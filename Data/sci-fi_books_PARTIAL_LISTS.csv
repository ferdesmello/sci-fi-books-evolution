The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress;Robert A. Heinlein;1966;288 pages, Paperback;4.15;133917;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Politics'];It is a tale of revolution, of the rebellion of a former penal colony on the Moon against its masters on the Earth. It is a tale of a culture whose family structures are based on the presence of two men for every woman, leading to novel forms of marriage and family. It is the story of the disparate people, a computer technician, a vigorous young female agitator, and an elderly academic who become the movement's leaders, and of Mike, the supercomputer whose sentience is known only to the revolt's inner circle, who for reasons of his own is committed to the revolution's ultimate success.;TANSTAAFL = There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.My three favorite books of all time are (in no order) Heart of Darkness, The Dispossessed, and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. When I first read this years ago I loved it, I could not put it down. As Stranger in a Strange Land was a Robert A. Heinlein vehicle for theology, so is Moon is a Harsh Mistress to ideology. And just as The Fountainhead is the better, though less epic, of the pair with Atlas Shrugged, so is Moon is a Harsh Mistress, the more focused and simple of the two, better than Stranger in a Strange Land. I liked the setting, the use of libertarian principles and of course the brilliant work of the Grandmaster himself.This is a virtuoso science fiction futuristic re-telling of the American Revolution. Told from the first person recollection of a computer technician (with thick Russian accent) and of the birth and progress of the Lunar independence.The Moon (Luna to it’s residents – who call themselves Loonies) has been a penal colony for decades. It is the perfect prison, get outside the underground warrens and beyond the air locks and you’re on the moon. Without a pressure suit, you’re dead. There are very little rules and no real laws, so a hardscrabble anarchy has created a loose but tough and resilient populace who want freedom.Certainly this libertarian paradise could have become an anarchistic hell, but in Heinlein’s hard loving hands, his creation is the Free State of Luna. This story tracks with the American Revolution with unfair and distant landowners, inept and uncaring provisional governors (the warden) and even a declaration of independence on the fourth of July. Students of revolutionary movements will also see an allegory for “throwing rocks” as a statement about the earliest stages of discontent and reaction.First published in 1966, this was written at the zenith of his considerable powers and stands as a true classic of the genre. I just re-read this (one the very few books that I have read more than once) and may re-read it again – it’s that good.** 2018 addendum - it is a testament to great literature that a reader recalls the work years later and this is a book about which I frequently think. A friend commented about Heinlein books and I realized as we talked that when I think about Heinlein, my mind automatically defaults to this book. When I read SF I project this on that book and I wonder if that author read and was inspired. This is on my short list of all-time favorites and I think this should be on a very short list of greatest SF books of all time.*** 2021 rereadOf the hundreds of books I’ve read (as I type this in January 2021 over 1700) I have listed eight as my all time favorites: Heart of Darkness, Dune, The Dispossessed, Forever War, American Gods, Neuromancer, Breakfast of Champions – and Heinlein’s magnificent The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. This may be my favorite.I like science fiction. I like Heinlein’s writing. I also like history and political science and ideology. RAH has combined all this into a year 2076 retelling of the American Revolution except from the perspective of the Free State of Luna and of their winning independence from the tyranny of Earth.Central to this story is also a computer that developed consciousness, and in 1966 the idea of an AI was state of the market SF.On every page is Heinlein’s homely personality and his affinity for characterization and dialogue. Modern readers may see this writer (born more than a hundred years ago in 1907) as sexist or racist, but his ideas were socially progressive for his time and he explores themes of sexuality, family, and inclusiveness. His description of open marriages, of multiple partner relationships, and of a line marriage – where husbands and wives can be opted in and can last hundreds of years, was thought provoking.*** 2023 reread - I LOVE this book. On a very short list of my favorite books of all time. You know it’s a book for you when you smile just reading, like a visit from a very close friend.This time around I played close attention to the wonderful characters and their interactions revolving around the revolution of the Free State of Luna. Manny O’Kelly, Wyoh Knott (but don’t call her Why Not) and Professor de la Paz are the central - human - players in this magnificent drama that has it all - action, political and legal thrills, romance, humor, love, death and a very early AI presence in Mycroft Holmes.In the past I have been an apologist for Heinlein, responding to critics spoiling his work as racist or sexist with admonitions that he was actually very progressive for his time. I now want to point out how very progressive this was, with a population of Luna that is not only tolerant but welcoming of just about anything that works. Heinlein’s description of line and clan marriages and poking fun of bigots in North America was some of the best scenes in the book.Heinlein’s championing of libertarian ideals was also again very fun to read. Yes, I know, it’s a rough justice and a due process quagmire but it’s science fiction, have some fun.Brilliant.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16690.The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress
I, Robot (Robot, #0.1);Isaac Asimov;1950;224 pages, Hardcover;4.21;357728;Robot #0.1;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Short Stories', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];"Isaac Asimov's I, Robot launches readers on an adventure into a not-so-distant future where man and machine , struggle to redefinelife, love, and consciousness—and where the stakes are nothing less than survival. Filled with unforgettable characters, mind-bending speculation, and nonstop action, I, Robot is a powerful reading experience from one of the master storytellers of our time. I, ROBOT They mustn't harm a human being, they must obey human orders, and they must protect their own existence...but only so long as that doesn't violate rules one and two. With these Three Laws of Robotics, humanity embarked on perhaps its greatest adventure: the invention of the first positronic man. It was a bold new era of evolution that would open up enormous possibilities—and unforeseen risks. For the scientists who invented the earliest robots weren't content that their creations should ' remain programmed helpers, companions, and semisentient worker-machines. And soon the robots themselves; aware of their own intelligence, power, and humanity, aren't either. As humans and robots struggle to survive together—and sometimes against each other—on earth and in space, the future of both hangs in the balance. Human men and women confront robots gone mad, telepathic robots, robot politicians, and vast robotic intelligences that may already secretly control the world. And both are asking the same questions: What is human? And is humanity obsolete? In l, Robot Isaac Asimov changes forever our perception of robots, and human beings and updates the timeless myth of man's dream to play god. with all its rewards—and terrors.--front flap";"A Brief History Of Robo Sapiens In Nine Sequences  “Why … WHY does something invariably go wrong with them?”“Because”, said Powell somberly, “we are accursed. Let’s go!” Asimov’s collection of short stories is a stunning document of humanity’s struggle to find balance in a world increasingly dominated by technological progress, but with the same social, political and emotional conflicts as always.At first glance, the different stories seem to show the growing sophistication of robots, and their integration in human society. But the stories are not just a documentation of robots getting “better and better”, they also exemplify different aspects of human life that are affected by artificial intelligence. And it is more and more complicated to solve the resulting issues from story to story.The first, apparently innocent sequence features a girl who becomes dependent on her toy robot, and refuses to interact with humans and animals as a result. Not too scary? Well, whoever has hosted a birthday party and seen the children who withdraw from the fun to sit in a corner and play on their phones knows that the problem is real, and urgent. - Dependence on technology: entertain me if you can!The second story deals with failure within the robotic programming itself, when the three “Laws of Robotics” clash and cause a dilemma that the robot can’t solve. Who will solve it for him, then? - System Failure: please reboot the world and start again!Then we move on to the metaphysical aspect of creating a superior intelligence which makes calculations that are beyond human capacity. This sequence was the most humorous, in my opinion, showing a robot deciding to ignore humanity and create a religion around the Master, a calculation machine of great power. The scientists’ despair when realising that it could argue “reasonably” against evidence, was hilarious, but also frighteningly contemporary! - Technology Cult: In matters of faith, no argument is good enough!One chapter deals with the scenario of robots developing military behaviour. - Weapons of mass destruction? ""Die Geister die ich rief!""Another story explores mind reading, and delves into the dilemma of robotic rationality versus human ambitions, hopes and fears. - The Transparent Humans: Unable to hide their thought crimes!Of course humans also start bending the rules of robotics for their own purposes and benefits, creating secret robots that do not fully obey the laws they are supposed to follow automatically. And of course it gets out of control, creating highly dangerous situations. - The Law Is For The Others!And finally, we have the robots that are advanced enough to pretend to be human, refusing to be examined and discovered as robots by applying the judiciary system and their rights within it (as humans, ironically) to prevent detection. An issue of some relevance, as well. What to do with the democratic institutions that are abused by people/robots who only respect them when they suit their purposes? - The Democratic Supermarket: Take What You Need, Leave the Rest Behind!Asimov has assembled an astounding diversity of ideas in a cohesive form. While touching on the essential questions of the modern human condition, it offers an intriguing, engaging narrative as well, still readable and relevant in a world that is more technologically advanced than Asimov could imagine himself.In the balance between the human factor and technological system peculiarities, he leaves humanity with the eternal philosophical question of what defines us and what we define ourselves. And there will be hiccups, for sure, for the predictions on the future that close the novel can be rightly interpreted by different characters as: How horrible! Or How wonderful! O brave new world that has such machines in’t!Recommended!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41804.I_Robot
Childhood’s End;Arthur C. Clarke;1953;224 pages, Mass Market Paperback;4.12;164975;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Dystopia', 'Aliens'];The Overlords appeared suddenly over every city—intellectually, technologically, and militarily superior to humankind. Benevolent, they made few demands: unify earth, eliminate poverty, and end war. With little rebellion, humankind agreed, and a golden age began. But at what cost? With the advent of peace, man ceases to strive for creative greatness, and a malaise settles over the human race. To those who resist, it becomes evident that the Overlords have an agenda of their own. As civilization approaches the crossroads, will the Overlords spell the end for humankind . . . or the beginning?;"“No utopia can ever give satisfaction to everyone, all the time. As their material conditions improve, men raise their sights and become discontented with power and possessions that once would have seemed beyond their wildest dreams. And even when the external world has granted all it can, there still remain the searchings of the mind and the longings of the heart.”

The United States and the Soviet Union were in the midst of a military space race when large ships appeared in the skies over all the major cities. The aliens have come to keep humans from annihilating themselves. An act of altruism? Or do they have another agenda?The press dubs them THE OVERLORDS, but they much prefer to refer to themselves as The Guardians. They allow humans to govern themselves by whatever means they feel comfortable unless policy decisions involve hurting people. “Man’s beliefs were his own affair, so long as they did not interfere with the liberty of others.”  The Overlords also did not approve of hurting animals for sport. In Madrid, when the Spaniards insist on continuing to hold bullfights, a lesson is administered. Every time the bull is stabbed, the pain the animal is feeling is transferred to the audience. No more bullfights.Robotics and computers are advanced to the point that humans are only needed as overseers. Work weeks are cut down to twenty hours a week. (OMG sign me UP.) People are encouraged to go to college, to develop hobbies and skills, and even go back to school several times over their lifetimes to learn something completely new. ”The existence of so much leisure would have created tremendous problems a century before. Education had overcome most of these, for a well-stocked mind is safe from boredom.”And for a while the excitement of improving themselves keeps the humans on a spectacular track of not only bettering themselves, but also evolving civilization. Murder has become almost nonexistent, and when passion inspires such aggression, it is only the matter of turning a dial for The Overlords to find the perpetrator. When I google NSA, the National Security Agency of course comes up, but so does No Strings Attached, which I found very ironic. Given the range and the depth of what the NSA knows about all of us, not just US citizens by the way, maybe we should start applying the term The Overlords to the United States government. It would be nice if they would convert all this information into something practical, like catching murderers. Knowing how these things work, they may not want us to know that they are capable of doing that. We might get fearful of our government. 

Barrage balloons over London during World War II. Clarke observed balloons like these floating over the city in 1941. He recalls that his earliest idea for the story may have originated with this scene, with the giant balloons becoming alien ships in the novel.It seems to be the fate of all Utopias to turn leisure into sloth and turn unlimited possibilities into boredom. Interesting that Arthur C. Clarke uses the advancement of Television technology to be a major contributor to the degradation of a perfect society. People became passive sponges--absorbing but never creating.” Clarke mentions that people in this society started watching television three hours per day. Rookies! The latest statistics that I saw mentioned that Americans now watch five hours of television a day on average.Obviously, I don’t watch television five hours a day as can be ascertained by how many books I read a year. If the Kansas City Royals are playing, I do watch about three hours, but I’m also still reading and researching while the game is on. Baseball is the perfect background noise for doing just about anything, including taking a much needed nap to rest the noggin for a few minutes. When people ask me how I read so many books a year and still work full time, I usually ask them how much time they spend watching television or playing with their cell phone or playing games on their iPad? Everyone has the same number of hours in their day; it just depends on how you choose to use them. I choose to read. People who read fewer books than me are making different choices or in some cases may have more obligations. Of course, this is relevant only because I see reading as the best way to evolve the mind. I’m old fashioned that way.“There were some things that only time could cure. Evil men could be destroyed, but nothing could be done with good men who were deluded.”There are concerns voiced by various religious groups and also by people who are not thrilled about humans losing their ability to govern themselves, but for the majority of people the lack of responsibility and the lack of ambition to succeed are concepts they readily embrace. A society that was evolving to the greatest heights of artistic and progressive achievements starts to prefer apathy. The Overlords are very careful to control what the humans learn about them. A man named Jan Rodericks stows away on one of their ships and sees a world he can barely comprehend. “And in its sky was such a sun as no opium eater could ever have imagined in his wildest dreams. Too hot to be white, it was a searing ghost at the frontiers of the ultraviolet, burning its planets with radiations which would be instantly lethal to all earthly forms of life. For millions of kilometers around extended great veils of gas and dust, fluorescing in countless colors as the blasts of ultraviolet tore through them. It was a star against which Earth’s pale sun would have been as feeble as a glowworm at noon.” In one of those time travelling, mind bending events that I always have trouble fully comprehending, Jan only ages a few months, but has missed eighty years on Earth. The Overlords make allusion to the fact that science can destroy religions, but that science is not the top of the mountain, but only a stepping stone to a much greater understanding of life. They search through our archives looking for information on the paranormal and other elements that have been written about outside the realm of science. When the children of earth start to develop telekinetic powers, the true reasons for The Overlords being our guardians becomes clear. We also learn that the Overlords defer to another power much greater than their own capabilities called The Overmind. 

I caught a commercial for the six hour miniseries that the Syfy Channel is planning to launch in December and realized that I have hauled a copy of this book around with me for a couple of decades without reading it. Sometimes we need one more push. As always I’m impressed with Arthur C. Clarke’s ability to tackle the bigger issues and to be somewhat controversial in his presentation of the best and worst of being human. It does seem that we are incapable of possessing true happiness for very long. We are designed for strife, for pain, for joy, and ambitious achievement. When any of those elements are removed from the equation, we start to falter. Joy can only be fully appreciated if we experience pain. Ambition can only be relished if strife was overcome to achieve it. As The Overlords fix all the problems, there is a huge cost, too big of a cost, in that we lose what makes us unique. It is disappointing to think that harmony and lack of fear will turn us into beings unworthy of admiration. When defense is no longer a primary objective, it is disheartening to believe that the energy previously expended on security can not be transferred to higher levels of achievement in the arts, philosophy, music, and literature. To be the best that we can be, we still need the growl of the Sabretooth tiger coming from just beyond the edge of the firelight. We still need to be capable of picking up a club and saying “here kitty, kitty, kitty.”This is a short book, power packed with ideas and concepts, and certainly deserving of inclusion in the list of classic, influential, science-fiction books.

Pebble in the Sky (Galactic Empire, #3);Isaac Asimov;1950;308 pages, Mass Market Paperback;3.9;25784;Galactic Empire #3;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy'];One moment Joseph Schwartz is a happily retired tailor in 1949 Chicago. The next he's a helpless stranger on Earth during the heyday of the first Galactic Empire. Earth, he soon learns, is a backwater, just a pebble in the sky, despised by all the other 200 million planets of the Empire because its people dare to claim it's the original home of man. And Earth is poor, with great areas of radioactivity ruining much of its soil--so poor that everyone is sentenced to death at the age of sixty.Joseph Schwartz is sixty-two.This is young Isaac Asimov's first novel, full of wonders and ideas, the book that launched the novels of the Galactic Empire, culminating in the Foundation books and novels. It is also one of that select group of SF adventures that since the early 1950s has hooked generations of teenagers on reading science fiction. This is Golden Age SF at its finest.;In Isaac Asimov's very first published novel, Joseph Schwartz, a retired Jewish tailor, is instantly transported from 1949 Brooklyn to a time many thousands of years in the future, through an odd nuclear accident (scientific unlikelihood, but we'll let it pass). He finds himself on an Earth marred by high levels of radiation, presumably from past nuclear wars, that (scientific impossibility) apparently hasn't resulted in any physical ill effects to Earth's population, but has resulted in Earthmen being completely ostracized from humanity's galactic society as third-class citizens. Fan's of Asimov's The Foundation Trilogy will recognize references to Trantor here. And although this future Earth has a far lower population than now, The Powers That Be believe that there are not enough resources to go around, so this is an Earth where everyone over age 60 is euthanized, unless you're a government bigwig or some such. Bad luck for Schwartz, since he's already 62.Schwartz ends up getting treated by a local scientist's brain-enhancing machine (more unlikely science) and gets major mind-reading and mind-control powers. Meanwhile, the scientist and his (of course) beautiful daughter are caught in the middle of a deadly plot that could have galaxy-wide consequences, which draws in a handsome (of course) galactic archeologist. Pebble in the Sky is a little rough around the edges and shows its 1940s roots, with the outdated science and social attitudes. Other than the love interest, who is occasionally awesome but too often of the hand-wringing variety, and a cameo appearance by a farmer's wife, no women grace the pages of this book. But there are also some creative and intense parts where you see what would make Asimov such a great SF writer. It's kind of corny but it has its charms, if you like very old-fashioned, Golden Age science fiction and are okay with some major disbelief suspension.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41820.Pebble_in_the_Sky

A radiation bomb planted in his dorm room changed him from an innocent student at the University of Earth to a marked man, fleeing desperately from an unknown assassin.He soon discovers that, many light-years away, his father, the highly respected Rancher of Widemos, has been murdered. Stunned, grief-stricken, and outraged, Biron is determined to uncover the reasons behind his father’s death, and becomes entangled in an intricate saga of rebellion, political intrigue, and espionage.The mystery takes him deep into space where he finds himself in a relentless struggle with the power-mad despots of Tyrann. Now it is not just a case of life or death for Biron, but a question of freedom for the galaxy.;"Very enjoyable but “ Asimov light”. More tomorrowNow Isaac Asimov is one of my all time favourite authors, his Foundation novels are to me the epitome of SF space Opera, and he is my ""go to"" author when I want a great book, so when I felt a bit down/lost/in need of a lift, I decided to read this book as I hadn't touched it in probably 20 + years.It was an enjoyable book, without a doubt an Asimov book, but a little light, as in not as detailed and structured as some of his more famous books.For those unaware of Asimov's books, he wrote a series of Robot novels and what he called Empire novels that culminated in his excellent Foundation Trilogy. The Robot novels involve such people as Susan Calvin and other excellent characters through to R Daneel Olivaw who surfaces again in the final Empire novels, whilst in the Empire novels one can experience the wisdom of Elijah Bailey the Earth detective who inadvertently helps found the Galactic Empire.All in all this was a good book that can be read alone or as part of reading the Asimov Empire novels or indeed the whole Robot and Empire novels. Whatever you choose, enjoy.Oh and if you have an old copy, like me, you get the wonderful Chris Foss cover.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41822.The_Stars_Like_Dust
The Caves of Steel (Robot, #1);Isaac Asimov;1953;206 pages, Mass Market Paperback;4.19;104907;Robot #1;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Classics', 'Robots', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];"A millennium into the future two advancements have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain. Isaac Asimov's Robot novels chronicle the unlikely partnership between a New York City detective and a humanoid robot who must learn to work together. Like most people left behind on an over-populated Earth, New York City police detective Elijah Baley had little love for either the arrogant Spacers or their robotic companions. But when a prominent Spacer is murdered under mysterious circumstances, Baley is ordered to the Outer Worlds to help track down the killer. The relationship between Life and his Spacer superiors, who distrusted all Earthmen, was strained from the start. Then he learned that they had assigned him a partner: R. Daneel Olivaw. Worst of all was that the ""R"" stood for robot--and his positronic partner was made in the image and likeness of the murder victim!";"The Caves of Steel (Robot #1), Isaac AsimovThe book was first published as a serial in Galaxy magazine, from October to December 1953. A Doubleday hardcover followed in 1954.The Caves of Steel is a novel by American writer Isaac Asimov. It is essentially a detective story, and illustrates an idea Asimov advocated, that science fiction can be applied to any literary genre, rather than just a limited genre. In this novel, Isaac Asimov introduces Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw, later his favorite protagonists. They live roughly three millennia in Earth's future, a time when hyperspace travel has been discovered, and a few worlds relatively close to Earth have been colonized—fifty planets known as the ""Spacer worlds"". The Spacer worlds are rich, have low population density (average population of one hundred million each), and use robot labor heavily. Meanwhile, Earth is overpopulated (with a total population of eight billion, and strict rules against robots have been passed. The ""Caves of Steel"" are vast city complexes covered by huge metal domes, capable of supporting tens of millions. In The Caves of Steel and its sequels (the first of which is The Naked Sun), Asimov paints a grim situation of an Earth dealing with an extremely large population, and of luxury-seeking Spacers who limit birth to permit great wealth and privacy. Asimov, who described himself as a claustrophile, mentioned that a reader asked him how he could have imagined such an existence with no sunlight, and related that it had not struck him until then that living perpetually indoors might be construed as unpleasant. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه سپتامبر سال 1991میلادیعنوان: غارهای پولادی؛ نویسنده: آیزاک آسیموف؛ مترجم: شهریار بهترین؛ تهران، آواره، 1363، در 398ص؛ داستانهای علمی تخیلی از نویسندگان روس تبار ایالات متحده آمریکا؛ سده ی 20مماجراهای داستان در آینده‌ ای بسیار دور رخ می‌دهد؛ در آینده‌ ای خیالی، ساختار جامعه‌ ی زمین، فرهنگ و شرایط زندگی مردم، بسیار متفاوت از زندگی امروزین است.؛ در دنیای آینده‌ ی غارهای پولادی، مردمان زمین، در شهرهای سرپوشیده‌ ای زندگی می‌کنند، که آن را غارهای پولادی می‌نامند.؛ مدت‌ها پیش از زمان داستان، عده‌ ای از مردمان زمین به فضا مهاجرت کرده، و پنجاه کره را، در فضا مسکونی کرده‌ اند.؛ مهاجران با دستکاری ژنتیکی خود، و دستکاری محیط زیستشان، طول عمر خود را نیز افزایش داده، و در واقع تبدیل به ابرانسان‌هایی شده‌ اند، که نیاکان خود در زمین را، خرد و کوچک می‌شمارند.؛ شخصیتهای محوری داستان کارآگاهی به نام: «الیاس بیلی»، و روباتی به نام «آر-دنیل الیواو» هستند؛ زمین در سالی نامعلوم، حول و حوش 2600میلادی تا 3000میلادی است، که از سوی نویسنده، به درستی مشخص نمیشودتعداد انسانهای زمینی، به مرز هشت میلیارد نفر رسیده، و به همین دلیل با کمبود شدید منابع روبروست.؛ کشاورزی نوینی که حاصل شیمی آلی پیشرفته آن روزگاران است، ابداع شده، و غذای همه ی آدمیان را، از مخمرها درست میکنند.؛ کشوری با مرزبندی کنونی، ظاهرا وجود ندارد، و تنها شهرهای خودمختار وجود دارند، که همه جای زمین یکسان اداره میشوند.؛ انسانها داخل ابرشهرهای سرپوشیده، و با مقررات ویژه زندگی میکنند.؛ خانه های آنها، آشپزخانه، و حمام، و دستشویی ندارد، و همه در غذاخوریهای عمومی غذا میخورند، و در پرسونالهای عمومی حمام میکنند، و به دستشوییهای عمومی میروند.؛ پول جایگاهی ندارد، و هر کس بنا به کاری که انجام میدهد، دارای جایگاهی است.؛ پس اگر بهتر کار کنند، و در کارشان پیشرفت کنند، میتوانند امتیازهایی بدست آورند، تا بدانجا که برخی در خانه، اجازه ی تناول وعده هایی از غذای خویش را دارند، و اجازه ی داشتن آشپزخانه کوچکی، و در موارد دیگر، حتی دستشویی دارندبالاتریها، و سرشناسترها، میتوانند همسران و دخترانشان را، به مکانهایی که در طبقات بالا قرار دارد، بفرستند، تا حمام آفتاب بگیرند، و البته این مکانها هم با شیشه های ضخیم از محیط خارج جدا شده اند.؛ انسان با زمین بیگانه شده، و هوای آزاد را مسموم میداند.؛ طلوع و غروب آفتاب را نمیشناسد، و باران را ندیده است.؛ در غارهای خودساخته و بسته زندگی میکند، و ارتباطی با محیط بیرون ندارد.؛ انسان زمینی در گذشته های دور، پنجاه مستعمره ی دیگر، در فضا ایجاد کرده، که اکنون مستعمره نشینان از لحاظ فناوری، همانند اروپای امروز در برابر آسیا هستند.؛ آنها کم جمعیت و ثروتمندند، و عمر طولانی دارند.؛ چند سالی هست که (بنا به دلایلی که با خواندن داستان مشخص میشود) به زمین آمده اند، اما از زمینیان دوری میکنند، و در کنار شهر آنها، شهرکی برپا کرده اند، که روباز است، و آفتاب به آن میتابد و باران میبارد.؛ در داستان، روباتها کم کم به زندگی زمینیان وارد میشوند، و به جای انسان قرار میگیرند.؛ اهالی زمین این را کار فضاییها میدانند، و شورشهایی را علیه آنها برپا کرده اند.؛ داستان از جایی آغاز میشود، که در شهرک فضاییها قتلی رخ داده، و کاراگاه «الیاس بیلی»، مامور بررسی پرونده میشود.؛ از سوی فضاییها هم، روباتی کاملا شبیه انسان، به نام «آر-دنیل الیواو»، به عنوان همکار کاراگاه گسیل میشود.؛ ...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 28/08/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 09/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41811.The_Caves_of_Steel
The Currents of Space (Galactic Empire, #2);Isaac Asimov;1952;304 pages, Mass Market Paperback;3.85;20576;Galactic Empire #2;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Classics', 'Fantasy'];High above the planet Florinia, the Squires of Sark live in unimaginable wealth and comfort. Down in the eternal spring of the planet, however, the native Florinians labor ceaselessly to produce the precious kyrt that brings prosperity to their Sarkite masters. Rebellion is unthinkable and impossible. Not only do the Florinians no longer have a concept of freedom, any disruption of the vital kyrt trade would cause other planets to rise in protest, ultimately destabilizing trade and resulting in a galactic war. So the Trantorian Empire, whose grand plan is to unite all humanity in peace, prosperity, and freedom, has stood aside and allowed the oppression to continue. Living among the workers of Florinia, Rik is a man without a memory or a past. He has been abducted and brainwashed. Barely able to speak or care for himself when he was found, Rik is widely regarded as a simpleton by the worker community where he lives. But as his memories begin to return, Rik finds himself driven by a cryptic message he is determined to deliver: Everyone on Florinia is doomed . . . the Currents of Space are bringing destruction. But if the planet is evacuated, the power of Sark will end--so some would finish the job and would kill the messenger. The fate of the Galaxy hangs in the balance.;Once upon a time, one of my classmates had enthusiastically shoved a rather drab copy of Prelude to the Foundation in my hand. Not sporting a particularly handsome cover, it didn't exactly excite me, but I read it nonetheless. And for the next few years,  Isaac Asimov's reputation remained firmly parked on the absolute best author pedestal.So when I picked up his books again, I was naturally expecting to be just as bowled over, excited, engrossed in the story... you name it. Is it any wonder that I just couldn't quite reconcile the idea, that his writing is mostly boring, and that his characters' dramatic antics would be at home in an Indian soap?The squires of Sark have been ruling over the planet Florinia and its people for quite some time. Preventing the planet's citizens access to decent education, the sarkites have ensured lasting supplies of Florinia's precious kyrt, the only resource for the known world's most pricey fabric... and the key to Sarkite wealth, heh.But then a space scientist shows up claiming that Florinia and its inhabitants are in grave, and irreversible, danger. The man gets swiftly rewarded with a hefty dose of brain-washing and abduction. Unfortunately for his attackers, the simpleton Rik starts mumbling about similar evil omens a year later, so a mad chase ensues. And amidst all this chaos no one knows what Florinia's doom actually consists of, nor who Rik's attackers actually are.I admit that I absolutely LOVED the resolution of things. The reason for the doom was sufficiently dramatic, the identity of the bad guy was not very obvious, not to mention the very obvious link between Rik and the scientist.However all the above makes up about 10% of the book, and that's found in the conclusion of the story. So basically, until you get to the interesting stuff, you find yourself wading through a bunch of tedious dialogue, whiny politicians, evil cackling and a hefty dose of all around frustration.Score: 2.7 / 5 starsAsimov's plot lines are just genius. His books' endings contain just the right amount of drama, and the reader can't help but feel satisfied. His characters however, and their journey to said resolution, seem to be left up to chance: they're either utterly awesome (eg: R. Daneel Olivaw), or seemingly endless resources of drama (every single Sarkite from this book).=======================================Review of the 1st book: The Stars Like Dust;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85434.The_Currents_of_Space
The End of Eternity;Isaac Asimov;1955;192 pages, Mass Market Paperback;4.24;58528;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Fantasy'];Andrew Harlan is an Eternal, a man whose job it is to range through past and present Centuries, monitoring and, where necessary, altering Time's myriad cause-and-effect relationships. But when Harlan meets and falls for a non-Eternal woman, he seeks to use the awesome powers and techniques of the Eternals to twist time for his own purposes, so that he and his love can survive together.;"I've always felt that Isaac Asimov writes brilliant science fiction with boring characters. I love a good time travel story, mostly to see what this author's take on the usual time travel paradoxes will be. Anyone who writes about agents changing history has to explain how they deal with things like the Grandfather Paradox, meeting earlier or later versions of yourself, and so on. There are a handful of well-known ways to deal with these issues (alternate timelines, a deterministic universe, special laws of temporal physics, etc.) and Asimov is rather inventive in using several of them at once.Although The End of Eternity is brilliant in its construction of a civilization of time travelers and all the history and technology that goes into their society and the way they meddle with time, his protagonists are basically a bunch of whiny geeks who've never kissed a girl and act like highly-educated chimpanzees fighting for the highest branch in the treehouse. Asimov's vision of a civilization that spans millions of years and thousands of realities doesn't include a single one where women become scientists and engineers and might join the Eternals' boys' club. The entire plot hinges on not one but two high-ranking Eternals who decide they are willing to throw all of reality into danger for the chance to get laid. I know Asimov was a nerd and he wrote this in the 1950s, but he still could have done better. It's like the idea of women as anything but sex objects to be coveted or to seduce men off the path of Righteous Scientific Objectivity just never occurred to him. So naturally when a girl shows up (the only female character in the entire book), she must spell T-R-O-U-B-L-E, and in this case, the end of Eternity.I enjoyed the story, but Asimov has never been my favorite among the Grand Old Masters of science fiction; there is something just a little too cold and calculating in all of his stories. For the ideas and the plot twists, this is a fun book with a great premise, but don't expect Asimov to wow you with his nuanced grasp of human relationships. His characters are wire dummies to hang a story on.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/509784.The_End_of_Eternity

But when Andrew started to develop special talents which exceeded the confines of his allotted positronic pathways, he abandoned his domestic duties in favour of more intellectual pursuits. As time passed, Andrew acquired knowledge, feelings and ambitions way beyond anything ever experienced by any other mechanical men. And he found himself launched on to a career which would bring him fame fortune — and danger. For a robot who wants to be human must also be prepared to die...In the Bicentennial Man, Isaac Asimov returns to his first and most enduring love — robotics.

سفر اکتشافی بود. ماجرا از این قرار بود که روزی قطعه‌ای به نام ""خوشحال می‌شم بتونم خدمتی کنم"" از گروه اپریل رین نظرم را جلب کرد. این گروه روسی فعال در سبک پست راک، عموما در قطعات بی‌کلام خود از دیالوگ فیلم‌ها استفاده می‌کند و بدین شکل با تلفیق فرم موسیقایی و دیالوگ، دست به خلق یک اثر روایی تاثیر‌گذار می‌زند. در قطعه مذکور نیز به یاد رابین ویلیامز، از دیالوگ‌های ربات خدمتکار خانگی به نام اندرو(ویلیامز) در فیلم انسان دوقرنی استفاده شده. اینجا بود که نظرم به فیلم که خود اقتباسی از داستان مرد دوقرنی ایزاک آسیموف بود، جلب شددرباره‌ی کتابمن عموما با داستان‌های علمی-تخیلی ارتباط برقرار نمی‌کنم و در مورد این کتاب هم تنها به خواندن داستان مرد دو قرنی که حدودا یک سوم حجم کتاب را تشکیل می‌داد اکتفا کردمداستانِ مرد دو قرانی از این قرار است که در عصر استفاده از ربات‌های خدمتگزار خانگی، یکی از ربات‌های خانواده‌ی ثروتمند مارتین به نام اندرو دچار اختلالی در سیستم مغز پوزیترونی خود شده که در نتیجه آن، تفاوت فاحشی با دیگر ربات‌های نوع خود داد: او علاوه بر هوش مصنوعی، دارای عواطف و احساسات است، یعنی ترکیبی که به طور تخصصی‌تر شاید بتوان آن را نفس نامید. در واقع اندرو بجز ساختار بدنی، هوش و استعد��د فوق انسانی خود، از لحاظ احساسی و شیوه تفکر، تفاوتی با یک انسان ندارد. اندرو در خلال داستان و طی گذشت دویست سال از روزی که به خدمت گرفته شده تمام تلاش خود را می‌کند تا به عنوان انسان از سوی جامعه جهانی به رسمیت شناخته شودپی‌رنگ داستان مرد دو قرنی را می‌توان در این جمله خلاصه کرد: ""رباتی که می‌خواهد انسان باشد"". اما چرا اندرو می‌خواهد از سطح خود به سطح انسانی نزول کند؟ آسیموف در این داستان پاسخ روشنی به این سوال نمی‌دهد. اما بطور ضمنی او یک موضوع را پیش‌فرض گرفته که انسانیت، والاترین گوهری‌ست که یافت می‌شود. اما به‌نظر من یک نقص دراین فرض نهفته است: نویسنده در اینجا هم به عنوان خالق یک اثر علمی-تخیلی که ده‌ها سال از عصر خود جلوتر است نتوانسته عینک انسانی خود را از چشم بردارد. چرا هوشمندی ربات‌ها نیز مانند هوش انسان‌ها و هم‌سطح با آن در نظر گرفته می‌شود؟ آیا این موضوع ریشه در خودبرتربینی انسان‌ها به عنوان سرور و مالک طبعیت ندارد؟ آیا این موضوع، به نوعی شبیه به نظریه زمین‌مرکزی‌ای که از عصر بطلیموس تا دوران کپرنیک رواج داشت نیست؟نکته دیگرحین دیدن فیلم و سپس خواندن کتاب، ناخوداگاه یاد نگاه ارسطو در طبقه‌بندی موجدات زنده و نفوس زنده افتادم. اندرو تمام آنچه که نفس انسانی خوانده می‌شود را دارد: قوه غاذیه، ادراک حسی، میل، حرکت مکانی، نوس و دیانوئتیکون (قوه مدرکه). چه چیزی مانع انسان انگاشتن یک چنین موجودی می‌شود؟ تفاوت ارتباط نفس و بدن بین اندرو و انسان‌ها؟ یا صرفا فناناپذیری نه چندان مطلق او؟ درباره فیلم‌نامهبه جرات می‌توان گفت فیلم‌نامه هم در شخصیت‌پردازی و هم در سیر داستانی و روابط علّیِ آن به مراتب قوی‌تر از داستان اصلی‌ست و بخش‌هایی از دیالوگ‌ها نیز اگرنتوان شاهکار نامیدشان، حداقل حسابی به‌یادماندنی هستند. خودِ فیلم هم که با بازی ویژه رابین ویلیامز در نقش اندرو، به خوبی دگردیسی فیزیکی اندروِ ربات را که به موازات پیشرفت بعد احساسی او رخ می‌دهد به تصویر می‌کشدنقص پیرنگ در اثر اقتباسی، به خوبی جبران شده، بطوری که می‌توان انگیزه اندرو از انسان بودن را فهمید: عشق. اندرو از همان نخست، یک ربات عاشق است. اندرو در ابتدا نه چشمی دارد و نه صورت انسانی تا بتوان احساسات را در آن خواند، اما اسب چوبی کوچکی که برای خانم کوچک می‌سازد نمودی از همان عشق است که بعدها رشد می‌یابد و او را به مقصودی که سال‌ها برای آن در تلاش بوده می‌رساند. نخستین گام اندرو در راه عاشق شدن، بدست آوردن اختیار و در واقع آزادی‌ست. هم در فیلم‌نامه و هم در کتاب با این موضوع مواجهه می‌شویمدر این دادگاه گفته شد که فقط انسان حق آزادی دارد. اما به نظر فقط کسی که آروزوی آزادی دارد، می‌تواند آزاد باشد و من چنین آرزویی داریم. قاضی با شنیدن این اندرو سخن گفت: کسی حق ندارد منکر آزادی موجودی شود که فکرش چنان پیشرفته است که آزادی را درک و آرزو می‌کندآزادی برای اندرو، موقعیت شیرین استقلال را به همراه دارد. او حالا حساب بانکی و کلبه مسکونی خود را دارد. اما اندرو تا طی دگردیسی به انسانی کامل راه درازی پیش رو دارد. گام بعدی خود شناسی‌ست. خودشناسی اندرو نه فقط با مطالعه در باب تاریخ، انسان‌شناسی و تاریخچه ربات‌ها، بلکه طی سفر اتفاق می‌افتد. ایده سفر به مثابه آغاز راه خودشناسی و کسب معرف در این فیلم‌نامه بسیار پررنگ است. اندرو تنها زمانی می‌تواند به‌طور حقیقی به پورشا عشق بورزد که از سفر طولانی خود باز می‌گردد. با این حال هنوز چیزی سر جای خود نیست. اندرو با آنکه ظاهر انسانی گرفته، اما احساساتش بطور کامل تحت تاثیر منطق رباتیک قرار دارد: اندرو هنوز گمان می‌کند انسانِ کامل باید بدون خطا و مانند کامپیوتر فکر و رفتار کنداندرو: پورشا چی شده؟پورشا: من و چارلز قراره ازدواج کنیماندرو: اون مردِ خوش شانسیه، به هر دوتون تبریک میگَمپورشا: خدا لعنتت کنه اندرو... اگه میخوای توی این کار موفق بشیاندرو: کدوم کار؟پورشا: برای همین کاری که سعی داری انجامش بِدی، باید این رسمی بودنِ لعنتیت رو بذاری کناراندرو: در این مورد نمیتونم کاری بکنم، من همینجوری ساخته شدمپورشا: پس تغییرش بدهاندرو: تغییر؟ خب من که تغییر کردمپورشا: منظورم از بیرون نیست اندرو، از درون... مثلا یه اشتباه کناندرو: اشتباه؟پورشا: آره، بعضی وقتا این مهمه که کامل نباشی، مهمه که اشتباه کنیاندرو: چرا؟ تا از اشتباهم درس بگیرم؟پورشا: نه! تا درستشون کنی، تا بفهمی چی واقعیه و چی نیست، تا بفهمی که واقعا چه احساساتی داری. آدما اشتباهاتِ وحشتناکی میکنن اندرواندرو: فهمیدم.... این همون چیزیه که بهش میگَن مکالمه‌ی غیرِ منطقی، درسته؟پورشا: نه، این یه مکالمه‌ی انسانیه؛ این در موردِ منطقی بودن نیست، این در موردِ پیروی کردن از قلبتهاندرو: و این همون چیزیه که من باید انجام بدم؟پورشا: آره. و تو یه قلب داری اندرو، من حسش میکنم. بعضی وقتا حتی باورش ندارم، ولی حسش میکنماندرو: ... و برای اینکه دنبالِ قلبم برم، باید اشتباه کنم؟پورشا: بلهاندرو: ممنونعشق منصفانه نیستحالا همه چیز تغییر یافته و اندرو و پورشا کنار یکدیگر زندگی می‌کنند. سال‌ها گذشته، پورشای هفتاد ساله در حال حرکت به سوی مرگ است، اما اندرو در همان سن و سال پیشین خود باقی مانده است. اندرو نامیراست و بدین علت، طی ده‌ها سال ناظر مرگ تمام خانواده مارتین بوده است. از سویی دیگر انسان بودن و نتیجتا عشق او به عنوان یک انسان هنوز مورد پذیرش قرار نگرفته. اندرو در این میان باید دست به انتخاب بزند: زیستن تا به ابد به عنوان یک ماشین و یا زندگی و مرگ به عنوان یک انسان در کنار کسی که به او عشق می‌ورزد. انتخاب اندرو واضح است. اندرو مرگ به عنوان یک انسان و فنا در عشق را می‌گزینداندرو: من همیشه سعی کردم درک کنم. باید دلیلی برای چیزی که هستم وجود داشته باشه. همونطور که می‌بینید من دیگه فنا ناپذیر نیستمچیرمن: شما برای مُردَن برنامه ریزی کردید؟اندرو: به نوعی بله من پیر شدم و جسمم در حال تحلیل رفتنه و مثلِ همه ی شما در نهایت،عملکردش متوقف میشه. به عنوانِ یک رباتمی‌تونستم برای همیشه زنده بمونم، ولی امروز به هَمَتون میگَم که ترجیح می‌دم به عنوانِ یک انسان ، بمیرم تا اینکه برای ابَد به عنوانِ یک ماشین زنده باشمچیرمن: چرا همچین چیزی رو می‌خواید؟اندرو: برای پذیرفته شدنِ کسی و چیزی که هستم، نه بیشتر و نه کمتر. تنها برای حقیقت ساده‌ی پذیرفته شدن. این چیزی بوده که از ابتدا در درونم جستجو می‌کردم و باید به دستش بیارم، چه زنده باشَم و چه با شرافت بمیرمبه یاد رابین ویلیامز بخشی از کتاب که گفتگویی میان حقوق‌دانی به نام هسینگ و اندرو بود من را به یاد مرگ خودخواسته‌ی رابین ویلیامز انداخت. از نگاه من رابین ویلیامز مغلوب افسردگی یا مرگ نشد. پیروزی و باخت در مبارزه‌ای که پایان محتومش روشن است، چندان معنایی ندارد. ویلیامز تنها دست به انتخاب زد، نه یک کلمه بیشتر و نه کمتر.هسینگ بدون حرکت ماند، لب‌هایش را فشرد و گفت: منظورت این است که تو ترتیب مردن خودت را داده‌ای؟ ممکن نیست. این خلاف قانون است. اندرو در پاسخ گفت: نه، من بین نابودی جسمم و نابودی آمال و آرزوهایم، یکی را انتخاب کردم. تخلف از قانون یعنی زنده نگه داشتن جسمم به بهای مرگی گران‌بهاترپی‌نوشت: همانطور که گفتم تفاوت فاحشی میان داستان و فیلمنامه وجود دارد. دو ستاره، امتیازی است که به داستان آسیموف دارم. اما فیلم مرد دو قرنی، جزء فیلم‌های محبوبم قرار

Space Cadet;Robert A. Heinlein;1948;224 pages, Hardcover;3.85;9175;Heinlein's Juveniles;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Adventure', 'Speculative Fiction'];This is the seminal novel of a young man's education as a member of an elite, paternalistic non-military organization of leaders dedicated to preserving human civilization, the Solar Patrol, a provocative parallel to Heinlein's famous later novel, Starship Troopers. Only the best and brightest--the strongest and the most courageous--ever manage to become Space Cadets, at the Space Academy. They are in training to be come part of the elite guard of the solar system, accepting missions others fear, taking risks no others dare, and upholding the peace of the solar system for the benefit of all.But before Matt Dodson can earn his rightful place in the ranks, his mettle is to be tested in the most severe and extraordinary ways--ways that change him forever, from the midwestern American boy into a man of the Solar Patrol.;This novel was exactly what I expected it to be and in that sense I certainly wasn't disappointed. Space Cadet is not as complex as some of other Heinlein's works I read, but that is hardly surprising taken that it is basically a YA novel targeted at boys. I didn't expect too much from Space Cadet, and the main reason why I picked it up was because it was written by Heinlein. There was nothing surprising about the book itself, it was a simple moralistic YA story with a bit of science and food for the thought thrown in. I ended up enjoying it as the concept of Space Cadets and Space Patrol proved interesting enough and it kept my interest. In many ways this book reminded me of Spaceship Troopers, but it felt a bit more juvenile in tone. How would I describe this novel? Space Cadet is a lovely vintage SF book that has aged well. It is quite typical of Heinlein's writing of the time. It follows the adventures of young Matt who decided to join a prestigious space organization that is military in organization but is more a scientific/peacemaking organization. Matt didn't interest me too much as a protagonist (neither did the other characters, I guess the whole story was too YA to keep me on my toes), but I was fascinated by the concepts of the above mentioned Space Patrol and I enjoyed reading about it. This novel was written for a young audience, so it might be boring to some adults. I didn't find it boring at all, but that is probably because I have grown up loving SF, so for me personally these kind of books are classics of a kind and make me feel nostalgic. I would primarily recommend Space Cadet to fans of Heinlein and to younger readers of SF.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50852.Space_Cadet

It's likely that Asimov and his editors probably had their collective tongues firmly planted in their cheeks and grins on their faces when they tweaked the noses of Asimov's contemporary authors by proving that you didn't need rocket ships and space opera to write great science fiction.While he didn't wander too far from home in terms of setting, Asimov used his fertile imagination and probing intellect to weave stories that will touch you in a wide variety of ways. Like all good SF authors, Asimov used his craft to question government, human emotions and fears, our development of and reliance on technology, humour and imagination.Perhaps a couple of examples will serve to whet the appetite of those who have yet to savour Asimov's talent! What collection of Asimov's short stories would be complete without at least one from his vast repertoire of Susan Calvin's robots? THE DEAD PAST, like most of the stories he wove around his famous three laws of robotics, is a clever logic puzzle but it also probes deeply into the human psyche and our potential interactions with robots. Asimov's MULTIVAC, a computer character he returned to over and over again in an enormous variety of stories, appeared in JOKESTER, a clever tale that probes the very nature of humour and FRANCHISE, which takes a very well-aimed poke at political pundits and pollsters. THE IMMORTAL BARD, undoubtedly drawn from Asimov's well-documented non-fictional study of Shakespeare, is a clever jibe at our modern interpretation of this master playwright's work. And on and on it goes ...For those that have yet to sample science fiction in general or Asimov's work in particular, this would be a fine place to start. Intellectual, thought-provoking, and deeply questioning yet humorous and lightweight enough to be entirely unintimidating! Highly recommended.Paul Weiss;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/245645.Earth_Is_Room_Enough
Fantastic Voyage;Isaac Asimov;1966;186 pages, Mass Market Paperback;3.91;28331;Fantastic Voyage #1;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Speculative Fiction'];Four men and a woman are reduced to a microscopic fraction of their original size, sent in a miniaturized atomic sub through a dying man's carotid artery to destroy a blood clot in his brain. If they fail, the entire world will be doomed.;You know those tedious shows where they tell you to imagine you've been sent to a desert island, and what will you bring with you? For example, which book? As it happens, I have direct information to supply here. When I was about 9, we went off on an extended visit to Italy. My mother is Italian, but, for various complicated reasons, I have never learned to speak the language, even though it would probably have been the easiest thing in the world. So, I was already a book addict, and I was going to spend several months in a place where English books were almost impossible to find.My well-meaning parents reminded me that I should pack plenty of reading material. But, with somewhat unfortunate timing, I had just discovered Isaac Asimov. Specifically, I had just discovered Fantastic Voyage. I was a geeky, junior-scientist kind of 9 year old, and I thought this book was the most amazing thing I had ever read. I mean, they - wow! - they, like, shrink this submarine down to the size of a blood corpuscle and they inject it into this guy's bloodstream and they have to get into his brain and zap the clot with a laser (lasers had just been invented) before it kills him, but they take a wrong turn and need to go though his heart and then his lungs and then... Anyway, you probably don't want all the details, but there's even a hot chick in there. I had recently noticed that the world, among many other interesting things, contained hot chicks, and Cora, who's quite appropriately played by Raquel Welch in the movie, made the book completely perfect. I decided that I was only going to take Fantastic Voyage with me. No other book was necessary. I could never get tired of this masterpiece.Alas... I'm afraid to say I was wrong. Wonderful though it was, on the third re-reading I no longer liked it as much, and I don't think I even finished it the fifth time around. So, first of all, if you're being sent to a desert island, try and bribe someone to let you bring at least half a dozen books. But, second, if you have a geeky 9 year old kid and you're stuck for birthday present ideas, consider giving them a copy of Fantastic Voyage. Even though they'll probably change their mind after a while, they may think it's the greatest book they've ever read for at least a month.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83539.Fantastic_Voyage
The Puppet Masters;Robert A. Heinlein;1951;416 pages, Mass Market Paperback;3.89;33473;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Aliens'];First came the news that a flying saucer had landed in Iowa. Then came the announcement that the whole thing was a hoax. End of story. Case closed.Except that two agents of the most secret intelligence agency in the U.S. government were on the scene and disappeared without reporting back. Then four more follow up agents also disappeared. So the head of the agency and his two top agents went in and managed to get out with their discovery: an invasion is underway by slug-like aliens who can touch a human and completely control his or her mind. What the humans know, they know. What the slugs want, no matter what, the human will do. And most of Iowa is already under their control.Sam Cavanaugh was one of the agents who discovered the truth. Unfortunately, that was just before he was taken over by one of the aliens and began working for the invaders, with no will of his own. And he has just learned that a high official in the Treasury Department is now under control of the aliens. Since the Treasury Department includes the Secret Service, which safeguards the President of the United States, control of the entire nation is near at hand.;Heinlein, did you really combine a very sexist plot element with the assumption that no gay people exist as the icing on the cake of your very awkward, biased, and wanna be subliminal writing?Body horror initializationI don´t know how many mind control, body horror, parasite,… tropes had already been established at the moment Heinlein wrote this book, but it might certainly have had a massive impact on many pandemic, alien invasion, horror, and sci-fi works that followed and it has more suspense and settings than some of his other works.Conspiracy without a worldThe agent, spy, government conspiracy, aspect plays a small role too, but it´s more of a vehicle to give the characters options to talk too much. Worldbuilding and action are hold small, rare, and I often asked myself while reading why Heinlein didn´t go the info-dumping way in both directions, not just with monologues, but with worldbuilding too. Parasites grow bigHow to find a cure has so many interesting variants and the more creative people think about finding a solution to this annoying infiltration parasite symbiont problem, the more interesting plotlines evolve, be it focused on technical, biological, magical, or mental eradication of that nasty mind bugs.Conservative thoughtsThe language and the mentality of the main character are both strange and fascinating, it´s kind of listening to an old man with dubious mentalities reflecting about life, not questioning anything or being unsure about the rightness of his mentality, but more reveling in his own points of view and why he is right.Who cares about equalityHow common sexism and bigotry were and that it was a shocking revolution to dare to describe naked people may seem laughable nowadays, but the people really lived and thought like that and still do in many societies as if nudity was a crime. Because of this involuntary side effect of reflecting on human behavior, it´s a better read than it would have been because it´s one of Heinleins´ poorer works.Because there will always be controversy around Heinleins´ work and changing world views, I want to add some personal opinions at the end of the reviews It seems a bit as if Heinlein had been a lifelong searcher for the right ideology, as he switched from one extreme to the other, leaving marks of it throughout all of his works. This is the biggest contrast to others, who kept their work clean from bias and agenda and it certainly built both his legend, fanbase, and critics by provoking and polarizing. Of course, it´s the freedom of art to integrate serious elements, as long as they are not dangerous, but the thin red line tends to be pretty blurry and while some see him as a visionary for alternative society models others describe him as a conservative, hate-filled, unsure man. I don´t really care what his motives might have been, his work is something special and different, it´s just a prime example of why professional artists should keep their work clean from personal agendas, because that just, justifiably, feeds the trolls and ruins ones´ reputation as for example seen with the great three titans of sci-fi. Asimov: robots, psychohistory, foundation. Clarke: epic, subtle, philosophical, each time reading finding new depths, extremely complex. Heinlein: Meh, his writing was average, but did you know what kind of mindset he had regarding... See? While people will endlessly debate about the ingenuity of and inspiration from Asimovs´and Clarkes´work, they will remember Heinlein as the kind of strange uncle with borderline attitudes.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7171856-the-puppet-masters
Nightfall and Other Stories;Isaac Asimov;1969;350 pages, Mass Market Paperback;4.25;14510;;['Science Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Anthologies', 'Classics', 'Fantasy'];A collection of science fiction stories which examine various reactions to altered environmental conditions or bizarre psychological situations;"This is a hefty collection of twenty short fictions by Asimov, complete with his insightful and amusing introductions for each story. Nightfall itself is an undisputed classic of the field. It was published in Astounding in 1941 and is the oldest story in the volume by a good margin. It was made into a not-very-good film and expanded into a not-so-good novel long after Asimov's death, but its original version is still chilling and terrific. It's a little amazing that it didn't appear in any of Asimov's own books until almost three decades after it first appeared, but Asimov notes that it was included in so many different anthologies from so many editors that it was always in print and available. Most of the other nineteen stories appeared in digest format science fiction magazines such as Galaxy and F&SF in the 1950s and '60s. None of the others are as iconic as the title story, but I found them all to be interesting, occasionally amusing, and always entertaining. My other favorites (as best I recall; it's been a -long- time!) were Green Patches from Galaxy, It's Such a Beautiful Day from Star, and Breeds There a Man...?, also from ASF. It's a good, classic volume.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70771.Nightfall_and_Other_Stories
Time for the Stars;Robert A. Heinlein;1956;256 pages, Hardcover;3.98;9499;Heinlein's Juveniles;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Classics'];"This is one of the classic titles originally know as the ""Heinlein Juveniles,"" written in the 1950 and published for the young adult market. It has since been in print for 50 years in paperback, and now returns to hardcover for a new generation.Travel to other planets is a reality, and with overpopulation stretching the resources of Earth, the necessity to find habitable worlds is growing ever more urgent. With no time to wait years for communication between slower-than-light spaceships and home, the Long Range Foundation explores an unlikely solution--human telepathy.Identical twins Tom and Pat are enlisted to be the human radios that will keep the ships in contact with Earth. The only problem is that one of them has to stay behind, and that one will grow old while the other explores the depths of space.Always a master of insight into the human consequences of future technologies, this is one of Heinlein's triumphs.";*** 2023 reread - This really is one of his best, probably certainly the best juvenile.What’s so great about it?Good question, this was not on my radar at all until I read it a few years ago. You always hear about the “big three” from Heinlein: Stranger in a Strange Land, Starship Troopers, and Moon is a Harsh Mistress. These three were first published in 1961, 1959 and 1966 respectively. Technically Starship Troopers is generally included as a part of Heinlein’s “early” novels but thematically this is more a part of the middle period, what I consider to be the height of his powers. Time For the Stars was first published in 1956, and was the tenth of twelve of Scribner’s juveniles.First of all, there’s just a lot going on. There is telepathy between an Earth bound partner and a starboard astronaut, allowing extreme distant travel to be able to communicate with Earth instantaneously.There is also lots of technical scientific and engineering talk about getting out to the stars and then there is alien contact and Bob really played this up for the kids with adventure and danger and shipboard drama. As in Joe Haldeman’s magnificent Forever War, and Poul Anderson’s Kith stories, we also play around with time relativity and the odd phenomena of star travelers aging slower than the folks on Earth.And here is where we come to what I’m talking about this being so good. The title is a play on words: “time” for the stars about the relativity issues, but also the simultaneity of the communications (which provides some more fun) but most importantly, that time for the stars means time from humanity, the opportunity cost of exploration.In the book there is a class of spaceships and they are all named for famous explores like Lewis and Clark and Robert Byrd and Columbus. This is a none too subtle examination of a type of person who leaves hearth and home behind to find something new. Heinlein usually has better than average characterization but here he takes extra time to explore the relationships between those who go to space and those who remain behind. Heinlein examines the human cost of leaving humanity behind, for the sake of humanity.It’s a fun book for the YA crowd, as intended, but with much more for a discerning reader.**(Original review) The Corsican Brothers go to space.Or at least one of them.First published in 1956, Heinlein’s Time for the Stars is one of his Scribner’s juvenile books, and one of the better ones, somewhat similar to Starman Jones. The Grandmaster tells the story of the first survey ships going out into deep space to look for suitable planets for humanity to colonize due to overpopulation on Earth. Needing a simultaneous communications system, the powers that be hire on groups of telepathic twins (or triplets) to provide real time coms between the ship and Earth. (Ten years before Ursula K. LeGuin’s ansible, which was first described in her 1966 novel Rocannon's World.Central to the narrative is the accepted theory of special relativity, whereby a voyager on a spaceship traveling at close to light speed will experience a different time than a person on Earth. The protagonist aboard the Lewis and Clark remains relatively young while his telepathic twin on Earth grows old. This concept is also explored in Joe Haldeman’s The Forever War and most notably in Poul Anderson’s Tau Zero.Heinlein also explores the concept of faster than light travel and these ideas may have been included in his notes for the novel that would be completed and published after his death by Spider Robinson in Variable Star.A good friend of mine suggested that a reader who favors Heinlein’s early / juvenile works over his middle works from the sixties and his later experiments with the tacky and wacky feels this way because that was the reader’s first exposure to Heinlein’s work. This could be true, as I have always liked his juveniles and these were my first books of his I read. In whichever camp one finds himself, Time for the Stats is one of his better novels.My final point to make on this book is an unusual observation about Heinlein’s work in general. According to Goodreads, Time for the Stars is my thirty-second Heinlein book. Bob mentions cannibalism in a lot of his works. Weird, creepy, unusual. By my recollection, I think he has mentioned cannibalism in each of the following works:Orphans of the SkyStranger in a Strange LandTime for the StarsFarnham's FreeholdFor Us, the Living: A Comedy of CustomsMethuselah's ChildrenThe Cat Who Walks Through WallsThe Moon Is a Harsh MistressStarship Troopers;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/356.Time_for_the_Stars
Starman Jones;Robert A. Heinlein;1953;272 pages, Paperback;3.88;8925;Heinlein's Juveniles;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];The stars were closed to Max Jones. To get into space you either needed connections, a membership in the Guild, or a whole lot more money than Max, the son of a widowed, poor mother, was ever going to have. What Max does have going for him are his uncle’s prized astrogation manuals—book on star navigation that Max literally commits to memory word for word, equation for equation. From the First Golden Age of Heinlein, this is the so-called juvenile (written, Heinlein always claims, just as much for adults) that started them all and made Heinlein a legend for multiple generations of readers.;Astrogators in space!One of Heinlein's earlier juvenile novels, this is one where RAH describes in great detail the machinations of the astrogators, quite a bit dated now with computers and it is amusing to imagine as he did a trio of math geniuses sitting in chairs with slide rules charting out a space ship's course, but that was part of his charm. Some thin characterizations along with some very 1950sish language, but Heinlein was working his very peculiar magic and this is all the while a fine sci-fi story.**** 2019 Re-readWas this 1953 publication an influence on Star Trek the original series and Lost in Space? Was Max Jones an idea for James Kirk?Their characters are very different, but this bildungsroman does follow our protagonist from farm boy to ship’s captain in spectacular fashion in a way that would be suited to fiery Kirk. The description of 3D chess would indicate the possibility that Roddenberry and crew had read this. Likewise, getting some decimals misplaced resulted in the spaceship in Heinlein’s story to be lost could have been a seed for the later 1965 TV series.Heinlein published his twelve Scribner’s juvenile books between 1947 and 1958 and this one is the seventh. Starman Jones describes Max Jones’ journey from the hills of the Ozarks to command of the Starship Asgard and the many adventures he had on the way.This is packed full of Heinlein’s campy wisecracks and homey logic, but also tells a damn fine SF story and one particularly enjoyable to anyone who’s stood watch of naval ships as RAH adds his personal knowledge of all things nautical and in his own inimitable way.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/351.Starman_Jones
The Gods Themselves;Isaac Asimov;1972;288 pages, Paperback;4.09;65455;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Hugo Awards', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];In the twenty-second century Earth obtains limitless, free energy from a source science little understands: an exchange between Earth and a parallel universe, using a process devised by the aliens. But even free energy has a price. The transference process itself will eventually lead to the destruction of the Earth's Sun--and of Earth itself.Only a few know the terrifying truth--an outcast Earth scientist, a rebellious alien inhabitant of a dying planet, a lunar-born human intuitionist who senses the imminent annihilation of the Sun.  They know the truth--but who will listen?  They have foreseen the cost of abundant energy--but who will believe?  These few beings, human and alien, hold the key to the Earth's survival.;What’s a man supposed to do? Here is a novel that is greatly revered by critics and fans alike. It received both the Nebula and Hugo awards for best novel (1972 and 1973 respectively). Asimov himself identified this as his favourite. And yet…I normally really enjoy Asimov’s works. Foundation, especially, is one of my favourite SF novels. I am going to go against what appears to be the norm by not giving this novel four or five stars. It’s a novel I respected rather than enjoyed. I can certainly recognise The Gods Themselves as a good Science Fiction novel. It’s no surprise it won awards. The science is hard enough to break rocks, even in one sixth of gravity. No doubt using this book to teach some of the fundamentals surrounding atoms and isotopes would be a good ploy for a science teacher. This is Asimov in full-lecture mode. There is also a lot of dialogue as characters use one another as sounding boards to drive the science home. To borrow from the comment below: it’s a bit wordy.And perhaps most importantly. The novel opens with an apocalyptic notion of epic proportions. The universe is going to explode! Or, more specifically, our “arm of the galaxy is going to be turned into a quasar”. You’d think this garnered some sense of urgency. You’d be dead wrong. The story plods along at its own pace, focusing on relationships and theories to a mind-numbing extent. But what about the imminent end of all things? Oh, well, I suppose we’ll get to that later. In the end it would have been more satisfying if the universe did explode, just to shut up all these people.Now before I get crucified. I liked the novel (hence the three stars), I just didn’t like it quite enough. In fact I feel that it is far inferior to Foundation. That is just my two cents’ worth, and looking at the current rate of exchange it probably isn’t much at all.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41821.The_Gods_Themselves

For centuries, disease, hunger, poverty and war have been things found only in the history tapes. And applied genetics has given men and women the bodies of athletes and a lifespan of over a century.They should all have been very happy....But Hamilton Felix is bored. And he is the culmination of a star line; each of his last thirty ancestors chosen for superior genes. Hamilton is, as far as genetics can produce one, the ultimate man. And this ultimate man can see no reason why the human race should survive, and has no intention of continuing the pointless comedy.However, Hamilton's life is about to become less boring. A secret cabal of revolutionaries who find utopia not just boring, but desperately in need of leaders who know just What Needs to be Done, are planning to revolt and put themselves in charge. Knowing of Hamilton's disenchantment with the modern world, they have recruited him to join their Glorious Revolution. Big mistake! The revolutionaries are about to find out that recruiting a superman was definitely not a good idea....";"Re-Read 7/31/24:Going through all of RAHs work in chronological order. It's still truly fascinating to read all this in context to the time. As for the regular adventure aspect, showing us a utopia and giving us vast amounts of exposition through dialogue, I'm still shocked-and-awed that it still makes for a great read. :)Original Review:It's time to prepare for the 1943 retro Hugo awards that will be presented in 2018! (Why? Why not? Some books deserve love even if they're before the Hugos even began!)In this case, novels published in 1942 are eligible. Books like C.S. Lewis's Screwtape Letters are technically eligible but really shouldn't be. There's nothing much SF about the religious satire.On the other hand, I really enjoyed Olaf Stapledon's anti-novel and worldbuilding masterpiece The Darkness and the Light that came out this year and please imagine how thrilled I was to learn that Heinlein also published a bona fide adult-oriented novel, too!He was generally known for his Juveniles by this point, so an early adult novel is something of a treat. And fortunately, his writing is always polished and clear and sometimes funny and always full of light agendas. It's Heinlein! He's a very opinionated man. :)In this case, we're treated to science lessons on genetics and a superior-gene race of humanity planning on overthrowing the current Utopia. The hero is the ultimate perfect superman and I kept thinking about the Howard families in his later fiction, the prototype that gets so fully explored later.We shouldn't forget the day. 1942. Does this kind of story sound familiar? In Heinlein's case, it feels like a mirror to a huge segment of the American population that already agreed with the Eugenics movement and what was happening in Europe at the time. Maybe no one really understood the impact or scope or even the reality of the death camps, but everyone could see the implications and the stated goals. It was war and knowing the publishing field, there's a long stretch between when a writer finishes a text and when it actually gets put on the shelves. I'll assume for a moment that Pearl Harbor had not happened yet, or if it did, there was no way Heinlein could have fixed his novel to reflect America's sudden inclusion in the war.However, it should be noted that he got all the salient points and sentiments RIGHT. It might have been a utopia like Stapledon's work but unlike Stapledon, he went the full ""good story"" option with interesting characters, exciting plots, cool snags, romance, and a big blowout. :)Without even mentioning the Hugos or the need to find the best SF or Fantasy of 1942, I would have read this early Heinlein novel thinking that it's a very polished introduction to his later genetic-field obsession with longevity. No Lazarus Long here, but enough ideas were packed in here to stand proudly with any of his later works. :)Between Stapledon and Heinlein, I choose Heinlein for the sheer fun factor, the timeliness of the topic, the sophistication of the storytelling, and lastly, the idea. :) Stapledon might blow him out of the water for sheer scope and range of ideas and world-building and commentary, but Heinlein's soup had the perfect mix.He's my main choice for the Hugo. :) So far. I'm still reading, however. :)";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/540503.Beyond_This_Horizon

But one day Willis unwittingly tuned into a treacherous plot that threatened all the colonists on Mars, and it set Jim off on a terrfying adventure that could save--or destroy--them all!From the Paperback edition.;This was, hands down, my favorite Heinlein book as a teen. I read it at least 4 or 5 times. I really need to read it again as an adult, but Heinlein ... always an iffy proposition. Though this is one of his early juvie novels, so it's safer than, say, Time Enough for Love.Two teenage boys, part of the human colonies on Mars, are sent away to boarding school in the biggest city on Mars. In between getting into trouble with the new, insanely strict headmaster, they find out about a plot that could endanger both humans and the native Martians. It’s up to these two boys to save their hometown and their Martian friend from the nefarious forces of evil. Heinlein is especially imaginative here, with the unique Martian civilization and the realistic (at least for the time) details about humans trying to survive in the hostile environment of Mars. There's a pretty heavy gun ownership rights theme running through this book that may irk some readers, the sexual roles are straight from the 1950s (Red Planet was written in 1949, so understandable enough), people in authority tend to be corrupt and/or incompetent, and you have to be able to suspend disbelief in light of what we now know about life on Mars. Other than that, it's a rockin' story! But no matter what, I will always adore Willis the Martian with my entire heart and soul.

But his new owner, Baslim, is not the disabled beggar he appears to be: adopting Thorby as his son, he fights relentlessly as an abolitionist spy. When the authorities close in on Baslim, Thorby must ride with the Free Traders — a league of merchant princes — throughout the many worlds of a hostile galaxy, finding the courage to live by his wits and fight his way from society's lowest rung. But Thorby's destiny will be forever changed when he discovers the truth about his own identity...;Citizen of the Galaxy (Heinlein's Juveniles #11), Robert A. HeinleinThorby is a young, defiant slave boy recently arrived at the slave auction at planet Jubbul's capital Jubbulpore, where he is purchased by an old beggar, Baslim the Cripple, for a trivial sum and taken to the beggar's surprisingly well-furnished underground home. Thereafter Baslim treats the boy as a son, teaching him not only the trade of begging, but also mathematics, history, and several languages, while sending Thorby on errands all over the city, carefully passing along information and keeping track of the comings and goings of starships. Thorby slowly realizes that his foster father is not a simple beggar but is gathering intelligence, particularly on the slave trade. In addition, Baslim has Thorby memorize a contingency plan and a message to deliver to one of five starship captains in the event of Baslim's arrest or death. When Baslim is captured by the local authorities and commits suicide, Thorby and local innkeeper 'Mother Shaum' convey the message to Captain Krausa of the starship Sisu. Because the 'Free Trader' society to whom Krausa belongs owes a debt to Baslim for the rescue of one of their crews from a slave trader, the captain takes Thorby aboard the Sisu at great risk to himself and his clan.

Stranger in a Strange Land;Robert A. Heinlein;1961;525 pages, Paperback;3.92;318252;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Novels'];NAME: Valentine Michael SmithANCESTRY: HumanORIGIN: MarsValentine Michael Smith is a human being raised on Mars, newly returned to Earth. Among his people for the first time, he struggles to understand the social mores and prejudices of human nature that are so alien to him, while teaching them his own fundamental beliefs in grokking, watersharing, and love.;"Apparently a classic of the sci-fi cannon, I'd never heard of this book until it came up on a book club here. It took me a long time to read only because of lack of time, and a rather annoying trait the author has that I'll go into later.This is one of those books that tells us more about the period it was written in than anything else, so it's important to note that it was first published in 1961 and later again in 1968 - when moon fever was running high and people seemed to have high expectations for human achievement. Events are set in an undisclosed future but the older characters seem to remember the first moon landing, so I wouldn't be surprised if Heinlein was thinking of it being set around about now. With a mix of very daggy technology like ""stereo tanks"" (TVs) and large, clumsy listening devices, alongside hover crafts and spaceships to Mars, the scope of the setting is hampered by a 50s' imagination. Stranger in a Strange Land is about Michael ""Mike"" Smith, the ""Man from Mars"", offspring of two of scientists on board the original mission to Mars, who was raised by Martians. He is more Martian than human, especially in his thinking and outlook and philosophy, when he is brought back to Earth. Heir to a shitload of money care of his parents' heritage, it's unsurprising that the bigshots on Earth are wanting to keep him locked up tight. A nurse at the hospital where he is first kept, Jill, offers him a glass of water and in that one action becomes a ""water brother"" - the highest accolade for Mike. She rescues him from the politicians with the help of her journalist friend Ben and takes him to the home of a grumpy, reclusive man, Dr Jubal Harshaw, who lives with three young women who serve as secretaries - Anne, Miriam and Dorcas - and two men who take care of the property - Duke and Larry. Mike's particular talents slowly reveal: he can vanish things, including people, if he recognises there is a ""wrongness"" in them; he can withdraw from his own body and shut down his body so there is no heartbeat; he can teleport and think telepathically; he can absorb books in minutes and regulate his own body, making it muscular and mature at will; and so on. All of this can be done with understanding of the Martian language, which Jill starts to learn. He's completely ignorant of human ways, of human concepts - things like jealousy, possessiveness etc. are all alien to him. He doesn't understand religions and he has never laughed.After months on the road with just Jill, learning and ""grokking"", he finally knows why humans laugh and how to do it himself, and gets the human condition. It leads him to start his own ""church"", though it's more of a way of life open to people of all religious denominations, with free love and open mindedness, and abilities gained through mastery of the Martian language. With Mike set up as a new Messiah, a prophet, there's only one logical conclusion for this story.As a story, Stranger in a Strange Land is enjoyable and original. Yet, as a story, it's also bogged down with sermons, with Heinlein's opinions, and a very out-of-date mentality. It reads very 60s and 70s, though it was written before then. Not as far-sighted as it would like to be! It's especially noticeable in the relations between men and women, which have that faintly liberated tinge that's all really lip service, and a great deal of sexist language. Which is ironic, really, considering Mike's free love cult. There's also an affectionate insult for a Muslim character who's nicknamed ""Stinky"" that I couldn't help but be offended by.It does make it hard to read, though, when you come across lines like this, as spoken by Jill very matter-of-factly: ""Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault."" (p304) While today the statistics are more like ""nine of ten times, a woman's rapist is someone she knows"", the idea that it's ""partly her fault"" is still considered true by way too many people. To hear this come out of Jill's mouth makes it especially awful.Another example is Jubal saying: ""Pipe down, Anne. Close your mouth, Dorcas. This is not a time when women have the vote."" (p382) Granted, they ignored him and did what they wanted anyway, but there're a lot of these flippant, dismissive remarks all through the book. Product of its times, sure: just not at all futuristic.Then we come to the proselytizing, which the book is rife with. Today, reading this book, the opinions shared are very ""yes, so?"" - old hat, in other words. Though it is fun to read the rants, the set-up is cringe-worthy. Jubal is the main lecturer, and the characters around him serve as props. There are a great many ""Huh?""s from educated and knowledgeable people so that Jubal can share his abundant wisdom. One ""huh?"" is okay, but when each long paragraph of Jubal is responded to with a ""huh?"" it gets a bit silly. Frankly, it's bad writing. It reminded me somewhat of The Da Vinci Code, which also uses characters to expound the author's theories on religion etc. at great length. While these things did at times make it harder to read the book, essentially the book is easy to read and often quite fun too. Jubal's sermons (and when Jubal isn't around, other characters fill the role, like Ben and Sam) can be a bit heavy-handed and obvious but a lot of it I agree with, so it wasn't rubbing me up the wrong way. Mike is a challenging character to write, because in order to write a naive, ignorant character to this extent, you need to be incredibly self-aware. Heinlein has fairly good success here, and Mike's growth, maturation, development and resolutions fit the character and work. He has charisma and is definitely intriguing; yet because he lacks the human flaws, he's also somewhat unapproachable and alien: a good balance to achieve.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/350.Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land

Then a space pilot bought him a drink, and the next thing Smythe knew, he was shanghaied to Mars.Suddenly he found himself agreeing to the most difficult role of his career: impersonating an important politician who had been kidnapped. Peace with the Martians was at stake — failure to pull off the act could result in interplanetary war. And Smythe's own life was on the line — for if he wasn't assassinated, there was always the possibility that he might be trapped in his new role forever!;"Review also posted at Fantasy Literature. In Double Star, a 1956 Robert Heinlein novella, Lawrence Smith (aka Lorenzo Smythe or ""Lorenzo the Great""), an out-of-work actor, accepts a job to impersonate a man for a few days, without, perhaps, asking as many questions about the job as he should have. He promptly finds himself whisked off to the planet Mars, standing in for one of the most important political figures in the solar system, who has been kidnapped. Larry's first task: fool the Martians during a vitally important Martian adoption ceremony. But somehow one appearance as a double leads to another, and another...My (self-imposed) mission was to find a Robert Heinlein story where the enjoyment of the tale isn't swamped by the offensive content for which Heinlein is, unfortunately, well known. Double Star, I think, does the job pretty well. There are a couple of instances of eyebrow-raising dialogue, and the women mostly have secretarial-type jobs, but it's par for what you'd normally expect to see in 1950's books (even science fiction; the imaginations of mid-century SF authors had their limits), and nothing was too far out of line.Heinlein gets on his soapbox a little about personal freedoms and politics, but it's all good since the main message is equality for all races, including Martians and Venerians (aliens from Venus). A few outdated technologies like microfilm and slide rules appear alongside the spaceships and ray guns, but it doesn't ruin the fun. It's actually pretty amusing in a retro kind of way.This is a quick and humorous read, not terribly challenging, but enjoyable, and there are some interesting ideas about how acting a role can change you as a person, the importance of the political process, and the impact one person can have.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175324.Double_Star

Heinlein’s most controversial bestsellers, a recruit of the future goes through the toughest boot camp in the Universe—and into battle with the Terran Mobile Infantry against mankind’s most alarming enemy.";Kinda philosophizing the heck out of militarism.The only one knowing how much of the author is in this work is Heinlein himself, because it would be tricky to write a military sci-fi novel without glorification of war and a military dictatorship to give the whole thing that certain something. Was his writing too realistic or did he really believe in it, nobody can say for sure. Did he even satirize militarism in a way that was too subtly hidden behind the obvious happenings? Both military science fiction and war novels have been strongly influenced by the impact of this world, one of the first detailed descriptions of exporting war to outer worlds and what human society might be best suitable for endless intergalactic war. It opened the world for all kinds of alien psychologies, ideologies, intelligence, cultures, histories,.. and the variety of reasons for war against humanity or an alien race that could be generated out of the smallest difference. As so often, the first in the field has many advantages and Heinlein used it to write some of the conventions of these genres.But he didn´t forget his recognition signal, his trademark of provoking by giving his protagonists opinions that are far beyond acceptable, even for the 20th century. Again, nobody can be sure if the was trying to proselytize for his current ideology or if he had a razor-sharp way of holding a mirror in humankinds´ ugly face. I read some of his novels and Starship Troopers is at least something of a conversation between different ideologies between the protagonist and other characters and not just a kind of endless talking. I liked the idea that military education goes beyond tactics and psychological warfare and includes philosophy, ethics, and some kind of crude war morality. It seems improbable that any, especially quite kind of extremist, military regime might motivate their soldiers to have deep, theoretical thoughts about right and wrong, because that would include a higher danger of self-made troublemakers and progressives, but it gives the work a special touch. It takes it away from the primarily basic training, kill, and career mode and raises it to a second, parallel, higher level.The difference between the movie adaption and the novel couldn't be more extreme. In the book, we are living in a quite a kind of liberal, tolerant, benevolent dictatorship that offers humans the option to be part of the war machine if they want some voting rights, but it´s never Orwellian. The movie is nice, not much of the original content is left and the story loses close to any dept and subtility, typical blockbustering down to be convenient for the broader audience.It´s one of the most philosophical and controversial of his works because it isn´t as objective as it seems to be and is subconsciously dripping political ideas in the readers' minds. But such great introspections and insights are totally worth the danger of getting a bit indoctrinated and hey, the others around here are adults and not easy to influence, immature brats like me.Because there will always be controversy around Heinleins´ work and changing world views, I want to add some personal opinion at the end of each review of one of his works.  It seems a bit as if Heinlein had been a lifelong searcher for the right ideology, as he switched from one extreme to the other, leaving marks of it throughout all of his works. This is the biggest contrast to others, who kept their work clean from bias and agenda and it certainly built both his legend, fanbase, and critics by provoking and polarizing. Of course, it´s the freedom of art to integrate serious elements, as long as they are not dangerous, but the thin red line tends to be pretty blurry and while some see him as a visionary for alternative society models the others describe him as a conservative, hate-filled, insecure man. I don´t really care what his motives might have been, his work is something special and different, it´s just a prime example of why professional artists should keep their work clean from personal agendas, because that just, justifiably, feeds the trolls and ruins ones´ reputation as for example seen with the great three titans of sci-fi. Asimov: robots, psychohistory, foundation. Clarke: epic, subtle, philosophical, each time reading finding new depths, extremely complex. Heinlein: Meh, his writing was average, but did you know what kind of mindset he had regarding... See? While people will endlessly debate about the ingenuity of and inspiration from Asimovs´and Clarkes´work, they will remember Heinlein as the kind of strange uncle with borderline attitudes.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17214.Starship_Troopers
Methuselah's Children;Robert A. Heinlein;1958;276 pages, Paperback;4.01;20859;"Future History or ""Heinlein Timeline"" #22";['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Speculative Fiction'];After the fall of the American Ayatollahs as foretold in Stranger in a Strange Land and chronicled in Revolt in 2100, the United States of America at last fulfills the promise inherent in its first Revolution: for the first time in human history there is a nation with Liberty and Justice for All.No one may seize or harm the person or property of another, or invade his privacy, or force him to do his bidding. Americans are fiercely proud of their re-won liberties and the blood it cost them: nothing could make them forswear those truths they hold self-evident. Nothing except the promise of immortality...;"A must read for any true sci-fi fan! Simply outstanding!Selective breeding and carefully planned marriages with subtle financial encouragement from a secretive group called the Howard Foundation carried out over the last 150 years have resulted in a group of humans that have the extraordinary trait of extreme longevity - Lazarus Long, the patriarch of the Family, born Woodrow Wilson Smith, carries his two hundred plus years quite well! When pressed for his true age, he's either not telling or he won't admit that he truly doesn't know himself! In 2125, a series of events result in the global administration and the remainder of earth's population discovering the Family's existence. A frenzy of enraged jealousy erupts as a maddened, frustrated world seeks to discover the secret fountain of youth they are convinced the Family is guarding for their own use. Hounded by the threat of murder, torture, brainwashing and ultimate extinction by their shorter lived neighbours, the Family flees earth on an untested starship. The discovery of two planets and alien races that pose threats and challenges even more imposing than those from which they fled plus an overwhelming loneliness for the way of life they left so far behind lead them back to earth for a second try.In METHUSELAH'S CHILDREN, Heinlein has crafted an exciting novel, a message, a screenplay and the movie script all at once. Descriptive passages, while compelling and very cleverly written are sparse and infrequent and the plot is almost exclusively driven by razor-sharp dialogue. Heinlein's method of conveying the story through his characters' mouths has got wit; it's got dialect; it's got humour and intelligence; it's got sensible science; it's got humanity and it's got credibility. Their expressions and manner of speaking firmly place the origins of the story in the 1940s USA but somehow Heinlein has managed to inject enough charm to leave it timeless.For those like me that frequently read for the thrill, the entertainment and the pure joy of a story without looking for any subliminal message or morality tale, Methuselah's Children succeeds in spades. Hard sci-fi runs rampant through every page and fleshes out a superb story line - ""refreshers"" (think Star Trek's sonic showers), private space yachts, hydroponics used for mass food production, psychometrics (no doubt, first cousin to Asimov's famous ""psycho-history""), extreme enhancement of longevity through selective breeding, elimination of national boundaries and the implementation of a global administration, inter-stellar travel at relativistic speeds, super-luminal warp travel ""in the dark"" reached with instantaneous acceleration, cryogenics and suspended animation for long-term space faring, lunar and Venerean colonies, orbital construction of spaceships, blasters, aliens, communication in an alien language, telepathy, high speed bio-engineering, and lots more. Although Heinlein didn't use the word ""replicator"", he may well have been sitting on the script team for a Star Trek episode when he had Lazarus order up a customized kilt:""He sat down in a sales booth and dialed the code for kilts. He let cloth designs flicker past in the screen while he ignored the persuasive voice of the catalogue until a pattern showed up which was distinctly unmilitary and not blue, whereupon he stopped the display and punched an order for his size. Ten minutes later he stuffed the proctor's kilt into the refuse hopper of the sales booth and left, nattily and loudly attired.""For those that wish to dig a little more deeply - don't despair - Heinlein has got much to say that will keep many a party conversation going on a variety of topics: the psychology and, oftentimes, fear of aging and death; mob psychology; prejudice and the abnormal fear of something that is different than we are; the importance of work, activity and a feeling of contributing as a part of the human condition.This book was more than exciting - it was fun and entertaining in the bargain!Paul Weiss";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175319.Methuselah_s_Children

But her uncle's power makes her a political target.;I like Robert A. Heinlein, he is certainly one of my favorite authors. So I am biased and am here, his apologist. While I can understand many feminists dislike of him and of this book in particular, I even winced at some passages, I would remind some that he was progressive minded when he wrote these, and was born in 1907, in Missouri, and attended a very different Naval Academy from the one we know today. This was entertaining, a little thin, but a well played use of science fiction politics and suspense. I thought he did a good job of characterization of Poddy, if not completely three dimensional. I did feel the ending was disappointing and have read some other reviews that concur.Not one of his best, but it's Heinlein so a good SF tale at the end of the day.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50839.Podkayne_of_Mars

I read 2001: A Space Odyssey when I was a teenager and knew it was a very influential work of fiction because of the film and all the attention it had received. Still, though I found it very entertaining, I did not really get it. Thirty years later, I have read it again, and though I may not completely get it the second time around, the more mature reader can better grasp the vision and message of the genius author. I especially enjoyed the many allusions to other works and found the reference to Melville's Ahab particularly engrossing. Clarke’s prose is clear and descriptive and his story line linear and thought provoking. Not just an excellent science fiction novel, this is a work of literature, brilliant.*** 2023 reread - I knew back in the day that this was a true science fiction classic, and knew that it was a great work of speculative fiction, but I like it even more now and believe this is one of the greatest SF books. Something I did not pick up on before is the influence of Clarke’s own earlier work Childhood’s End. This 1953 novel, published 15 years before 2001: A Space Odyssey, describes many of Clarke’s most compelling statements about extraterrestrial life and these themes were revisited in 2001.I’ve read quite a few of his books and I can also see that this was a literary stretch for him, he expanded the philosophical approach of most of his canon while telling a story with some very cool elements. Readers will pick up on horrific aspects of the book as well as different angles on his ordinary SF themes. His writing was better than most of his other works, and they are all good for the most part, and I wondered about his collaboration with Stanley Kubrick.This was not a novelization of the film, nor was the film based upon the book. Clarke and Kubrick worked on the novel and screenplay contemporaneously and I think that the synergy of their efforts provided to us one of the finest stories, told in both prose and film, that we have seen.Highly recommended.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70535.2001
Rendezvous with Rama (Rama, #1);Arthur C. Clarke;1973;243 pages, Paperback;4.12;172882;Rama #1;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Classics', 'Novels'];At first, only a few things are known about the celestial object that astronomers dub Rama. It is huge, weighing more than ten trillion tons. And it is hurtling through the solar system at an inconceivable speed. Then a space probe confirms the unthinkable: Rama is no natural object. It is, incredibly, an interstellar spacecraft. Space explorers and planet-bound scientists alike prepare for mankind's first encounter with alien intelligence. It will kindle their wildest dreams... and fan their darkest fears. For no one knows who the Ramans are or why they have come. And now the moment of rendezvous awaits — just behind a Raman airlock door.;"“But at least we have answered one ancient question. We are not alone. The stars will never again be the same to us.” 
I always find it interesting to see whether science fiction classics end up standing up to the test of time, given ever-changing technology, paradigms and culture. Some of them still shine, while others become hopelessly dated and irrelevant.Well, to me Rama, published in 1973, withstood the test of time, regardless of rare instances of eyebrow-raising. It is a classic SF novel of first contact - but done a bit differently, and full of the sense of wonder and the beauty of exploration of something amazingly strange and ultimately unknowable, the feeling of awe at mysteries that may be greater than we can imagine. All of it is done in such a short book - just slightly over 200 pages - and it uses each one of them just right (well, maybe minus that ‘bouncy breasts in low gravity’ paragraph).

The first contact here is not really with aliens — but rather with their amazing creation. A crew of a spaceship spends several weeks exploring the apparently dead and deserted colossal alien starship, basically a miniature world with cities and the Cylindrical Sea, built like an O’Neill cylinder (lovely video of what that would look like if made for humans rather than aliens is here). It’s very much a plot-driven story, very different from the now-customary character-driven approach. The sparsely sketched-out characters are there just as the vehicles for the exploration of the true protagonist - Rama itself, the enigmatic starship on an unknowable journey. And that was really interesting, having humans surrender the stage to the location as the true protagonist, because truly in the great scheme of things our existence doesn’t even seem to be a blip on Rama’s radar.
“Feeling extremely foolish, the acting representative of Homo sapiens watched his First Contact stride away across the Raman plain, totally indifferent to his presence.”
 

The point is Rama and the exploration of it — and not the humans. There are no character arcs, no romantic subplots, no conventional mysteries, no antagonists (minus the brief bomb scene that barely qualifies), no monsters, no battles, no important knowledge exchange — nothing that you would associate with the conventional First Contact story. No, it’s just a journey trying - and failing - to understand an artifact. Maybe a bit of Solaris vibe in the idea that we may not get things and that it’s not about us. Just sit back and look at the wonders and take notes and speculate on the whys and hows — and that worked so well for me.It’s a novel that it engaging without actually trying too hard to be such.
“[…] It had given a final, almost contemptuous proof of its total lack of interest in all the worlds whose peace of mind it had so rudely disturbed.”
And I actually loved the ending — that the mysteries remain mysteries because they are not meant for humans to solve, because humans end up completely inconsequential - especially after they were all becoming so convinced that Rama was trying to take over “our” system and instead it was barely a pit stop on the way. It’s a similar sentiment like in Roadside Picnicby Strugatsky brothers — humans are of little importance to the greater cosmic things. I loved how everyone was taken down a peg.

Apparently there are sequels written many years later in collaboration with another writer, supposedly more in the “traditional” space opera style, different from this gem of a book. I haven’t decided whether I’m ready to unveil the mysteries of Rama or whether I am content sticking with it as a standalone story full of mysteries that we will never solve as they aren’t meant for us (as Clarke’s initial intention apparently was). Probably it’s better to let it stand on its own.Solid 4 stars.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537.Rendezvous_with_Rama

I'm not wild about the orange cover (is that supposed to be David Bowie?), but the book is very nicely read by Buck Schirner. Most of the paperback editions only contained four of the original six. (The whole series is included in the omnibus The Past Through Tomorrow, which I highly recommend.) Life-Line was Heinlein's first published story, and is an interesting character study but doesn't fit in too well with the themes and continuity he was later to develop. Let There Be Light is a fine story that mixes economics and politics with the science, and features one of his first female strong characters, scientist Mary Lou Martin. The Roads Must Roll is a classic about patriotism and loyalty that I liked very much but never felt that it fit in the sequence too convincingly. Blowups Happen is another classic, and is a examination of the psychology of warfare. Remember, in the 1950s schoolchildren had atom bomb drills the way later generations executed fire drills. The other two, The Man Who Sold the Moon and its sequel, Requiem, are the very touching story of a man who did what he felt was the most important thing by all means necessary; it's how space exploration should have been initiated. The stories have been criticized some for what are now seen as sexist and racist attitudes, but it must be remembered that they were written seventy or eighty years ago. Compared to most of the other works of the time, not just in the sf field, they're remarkably advanced in social attitude. I believe Heinlein will always be one of the most important writers in the history of the genre.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16688.The_Man_Who_Sold_the_Moon

Their aircraft had begun to crash at an alarming rate, and no one could figure out what was going wrong. Desperate for an answer, they turned to Waldo, the crippled genius who lived in a zero-g home in orbit around Earth.But Waldo had little reason to want to help the rest of humanity — until he learned that the solution to their problems also held the key to his own...Magic, Inc.Under the guise of an agency for magicians, Magic, Inc. was systematically squeezing out the small independent magicians. Then one businessman stood firm. With the help of an Oxford-educated African shaman and a little old lady adept at black magic, he went straight to the demons of Hell to resolve the problem — once and for all!;"This was another of my listens whilst building my motorcycle shed.So anyone who has read my profile or seen some of my reviews will know that I am (and and have been for over 45 years) a keen science fiction reader and avid fan. Fantasy ? Well maybe not so much but I occasionally enjoy it.Now with that as an intro, this ""book"" was going to be interesting as it is basically 2 novellas; Waldo, a sf story (from which we get the word ""Waldo', as in remote manipulators), and Magic Inc., an out and out fantasy novel based around magic.Waldo well, hmm. I was really enjoying the story up until towards the end, when  Waldo discovers these mysterious powers (not a problem), but then he loses weight develops muscles and becomes both a world class dancer and surgeon. He becomes a jovial character with a good word for everyone, huh ? He was great as a miserable, selfish genius. Why would he become so full of ""bon homie"" towards his fellow man. And given his ""powers"" why did he not do more towards either helping his fellow man or making huge amounts of money?? So to me the story ends on the wrong note and doesn't ring true really So max of 3.5 stars ⭐️Magic Inc; now this was a fantasy story, again that I had never read despite having read so much Heinlein over the years, so I wasn't expecting a huge amount. Boy was I wrong. This might be fantasy and it might focus all the way through on Magic, but it is a fantastic story, well written with really interesting characters, and, AND, AND it is so well constructed from beginning to the end. So an easy 5 stars ⭐️Overall then its a 4 star (audio) book, with a fantastic narrator in MacLeod Andrews. I read a lot of Heinlein through the 70s and early 80s (after that I personally felt his work became to introverted and weird ) and in my humble opinion these were good examples (ish ) of his ""good"" period.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121586.Waldo_and_Magic_Inc

But nothing endures forever. The smoldering embers of liberty have burst into flame again. It is time for a new beginning.Contents:· The Innocent Eye: An Introduction by Henry Kuttner· If This Goes On - originally published in Astounding Science Fiction February 1940· Coventry - originally published in Astounding Science Fiction July 1940 · Misfit - originally published in Astounding Science Fiction November 1939 · Concerning Stories Never Written: Postscript by Robert A. Heinlein;"The USA today seems intent on proving Heinlein right!As the 21st century comes to a close, Nehemiah Scudder is First Prophet. Once a low IQ itinerant backwoods preacher, he now sits at the pinnacle of a fundamentalist Christian theocracy. It rules the former USA from New Jerusalem, the seat of an oppressive, right-wing government that punishes sin, heresy, blasphemy or even any openly expressed lapses of a doubting faith with all of the awesome power of modern technology, science and even applied psychology or psychotherapy. John Lyle, a young man proud of his recent appointment to the First Prophet’s corps of bodyguards, believes himself to be happy, devout and confirmed in his faith. But when he commits the “crime” of falling in love with one of the Prophet’s brigade of “virgins”, held in thrall for sexual services, he is forced to seek out the help of The Cabal, an undercover resistance movement dedicated to overthrowing the theocracy.Heinlein posited some thoughts on organized religion, government, power and revolution that were memorably thought-provoking and, if they were relevant in the 1950s, then they are even more important and relevant today:“You can’t conquer a free man; the most you can do is kill him.”“You can sway a thousand men by appealing to their prejudices quicker than you can convince one man by logic.”“Openly expressed piety is insufferable conceit”“No people was ever held in subjection long except through their own consent.”But the fact is that Heinlein’s writing in Revolt in 2100 is unable to clear the bar that he set for himself in such later, more polished novels as Methuselah’s Children. It’s blunt, ham-handed and melodramatic, the dialogue is stilted and trite, the romance is juvenile, and the manner in which the otherwise poignant ideas are expressed is in-your-face and over-the-top with nary a single subtle moment in sight.I’m not sorry that I took a few hours out of my life to read it. Jeff Sessions’ obnoxious recent establishment of a Religious Liberty Task Force (with the openly stated goal of combating ""dangerous secularism"")in response to the unrelenting pressure exerted by evangelical Christians in the halls of power in Washington make the message more important than ever. And, if a reader is paying any attention to the current events that are unfolding in the world around him, they will realize that Heinlein was nothing, if not prescient, when he penned Revolt in 2100. But, that said, there is still little positive that can be said about the quality of the story itself. Four stars for the message with a grudging single star for the writing brings the novel in at two stars overall.Paul Weiss";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1116661.Revolt_in_2100
The Black Star Passes;John W. Campbell Jr.;1930;176 pages, Paperback;3.15;326;Arcot, Morey and Wade a.k.a. The Black Star #1;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Classics', 'Pulp', '20th Century', 'Audiobook'];THREE AGAINST THE STARS! A sky pirate armed with superior weapons of his own invention... First contact with an alien race dangerous enough to threaten the safety of two planets... The arrival of an unseen dark sun whose attendant marauders aimed at the very end of civilization in this Solar System... These were the three challenges that tested the skill and minds of the brilliant team of scientist-astronauts Arcot, Wade, and Morey. Their initial adventures are a classic of science fiction which first brought the name of their author, John W. Campbell, Jr., into prominence as a master of the inventive imagination -- long before he became the editor of Astounding/Analog and changed the field of science fiction forever!;"Back in the late 1970s and early '80s, some of my favorite reading material, sci-fi-wise, was the wonderful series of 21 ""Best of"" anthologies put out by Ballantine. In an early indication of my future tastes, my favorites among those 21 collections were those by C.L. Moore, Henry Kuttner, Leigh Brackett, Edmond Hamilton and Philip K. Dick, although to be truthful, I thoroughly enjoyed them all...with one exception. ""The Best of John W. Campbell,"" it seemed to me, was just OK; a bit crude, and just too dryly written for my tastes...with the exception of one story, the now-classic ""Who Goes There?,"" which was of course rather loosely transformed into the excellent 1951 film ""The Thing (From Another World),"" and more faithfully adapted by John Carpenter as 1982's ""The Thing."" John W.Campbell, as most of the sci-fi community knows, made his main contribution to the genre as the editor of ""Astounding Science-Fiction"" from 1937 till his death in 1971; indeed, he is generally regarded as the single most important editor in sci-fi history, not only helping to steer the young genre into maturity but also fostering the careers of such future luminaries as Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, A.E. van Vogt and many others, thereby ushering in science fiction's ""Golden Age."" It had been a good 35 years since my last underwhelming Campbell dose, and so, figuring that the time was right to give him another chance (as a writer, that is), I picked up the volume entitled ""The Black Star Passes."" Originally released in hardcover in 1953, the three linked novellas in the book first appeared in 1930 (when Campbell was only 20) in the original science fiction pulp magazine, Hugo Gernsback's ""Amazing Stories."" And it would seem that my memory of more than three decades past was not in error; these tales are decidedly dry, crudely written and creaky...but still, somehow, compelling, and surely of historical interest today.In the first novella, ""Piracy Preferred,"" which takes place in either 2116 or 2126 (depending on which of my Ace paperback's typos is to be disbelieved), a supercriminal has invented an invincible knockout gas as well as the secret of invisibility, with which he commences to steal from the aircraft of Transcontinental Airways while they are in mid-flight! It is up to the nation's top physicist, Dick Arcot, his engineering pal Robert Morey, and their designing buddy Fuller, to stop the madman. In ""Solarite,"" which picks up three months later, the trio is back, aided now by the rehabilitated pirate of the previous story, the scientific genius Wade. The four decide to build a ship capable of interplanetary flight and ultimately DO make it to Venus, where they become embroiled in a war between the northern and southern continents. Finally, in ""The Black Star Passes,"" the residents of a dying solar system set their eyes on our worlds and send a humongous armada of spaceships in their bid for conquest. Once again, it is up to Arcot, Morey, Fuller and Wade to think of a means of combating the menace, leading to a full-bore space battle between the invaders and the Earth/Venus allies.As is my wont, I shall endeavor to find something nice to say about the book in question, dated and clunky as it may be. Campbell certainly does have a wide-ranging imagination, and his love of science and its limitless possibilities is certainly apparent here. That elusive ""sense of wonder,"" which was held at a premium in early sci-fi tales, is captured by the author intermittently, and when his tales don’t grind to a halt courtesy of scientific ""info dumps,"" they really do move. Campbell even manages to foresee the use of ""guided missiles with atomic warheads,"" which Arcot considers using against the ""Venerians"" at one point. But basically, these stories can be something of a tough slog. Campbell, who was a physics major at M.I.T. when he wrote these tales, admits in his intro that his early efforts were written for fellow science geeks and engineers, and boy, does it ever show! Rather than using scientific chatter to flesh out his story, Campbell instead seems to be adding some sort of loose plots to expound his physics and engineering extrapolations. In his introduction to ""The Best of John W. Campbell,"" author Lester del Rey tells us ""...in those days, the science fiction stories had almost no literary value. They were crudely written, at best, and there was little attempt at characterization. The people were merely used as props to discuss the heavy use of superscience and to make the simple plots work."" And that is most assuredly the case here. Arcot & Co. will often engage in pages of discussion regarding counterbalanced condensers, bus bars, Jolly scales, the specific gravity of Venusian elements, and the construction of a new solar generator or molecular motion gizmo. In the latter two stories, the team explores the spaceships of the Venusians and the extrasolar invaders, commenting at length on the generators and so on to wearisome effect. Yes, all this science chatter DOES add a patina of realism to the proceedings, but most people, I have a feeling, will be screaming ""Get on with it!"" When Campbell tells us at one point that ""The planning continued with exasperating slowness,"" the reader cannot agree more!And despite all this goobledygook, much of Campbell's science comes off as impossibly dated. For example, the Venerians of the southern continent have mile-long aircraft built of impenetrable armor, but how are these supermachines moved around? Via 100 propellers on the wings! In assorted bits of science fallacy, Campbell tells us that the Earth is 2 billion years old, whereas we now know that it is more on the order of 5 billion. He says that Venus has a 24-hour day, like Earth, whereas its ""day"" is actually more like 243 of ours. He tells us that Venus' surface temperature is 150 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas 860 degrees would be closer to the mark. He mentions the substance called coronium as being a new element found in our sun, whereas this ""new element"" was shown, later in the 1930s, to be merely composed of highly ionized nickel and iron. Another dated item: Istanbul is referred to as Constantinople, even though it had been renamed in the early '20s! And one more problem: When Campbell gives us the percent constituents of Venus' atmosphere (""23 percent oxygen, .1 percent carbon dioxide...""), they add up to...104 percent? And then there is the matter of women in Campbell’s book. There are none--not one--in all its 250-page length. Truly, this is strictly boys' club reading material. So much so that when our quartet decides to christen their spaceship, the Solarite, Arcot declares, ""We can't have a pretty girl christen this ship, that's sure. A flying bachelor's apartment christened by a mere woman? Never!"" In a word, oy!But I have perhaps saved ""the best"" for last. The name that Campbell gives the residents of that dying black star, despite their pale white skins, is Nigrans; their star, of course, receives the rather unfortunate appellation Nigra. Now, ordinarily I might not make a big deal of this, but in light of Campbell's later racist comments (he famously proclaimed that the U.S. slaves of the 18th and 19th centuries had a higher standard of living than they'd had in Africa, and that the 1965 Watts riots could be partially explained by the fact that some men were ""natural slaves"" who were unhappy as free men!), his poorly chosen nomenclature for this alien race cannot come off as anything but subtly (perhaps not so subtly) bigoted. So I suppose the bottom line is that if misogynistic, racist, dated sci-fi is your cup of tea, ""The Black Star Passes"" just might be for you! In his introduction to the current Rocket Ride Books edition of ""Who Goes There?,"" William F. Nolan tells us ""In today’s character-driven sf market most of the early Campbell fiction has become outdated,"" and I would certainly not argue with that assessment here. This is most surely a book that can only be recommended to those curious about the young roots of science fiction.

Foundation (Foundation, #1);Isaac Asimov;1951;244 pages, Hardcover;4.17;559750;Foundation (Publication Order) #1;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera'];The first novel in Isaac Asimov's classic science-fiction masterpiece, the Foundation series For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. But only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future--to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save humankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire--both scientists and scholars--and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.;"Honestly, I don't get why this book/series is so popular. There are some interesting elements to it (for instance, the use of religion as a tool of mass control and the implicit resultant argument that religion is no more than a fraud, ""the opiate of the people,"" after all), but the book gave me little to enjoy or dig into. The forces of the novel are broad, historical, dealing with masses of people; this means that there is little to no room for individual characters here and little to be done by the few characters who do appear. One leader says, in fact, in response to a crisis, the threat of warfare and annihilation, ""I'm going to do nothing. One hundred percent of nothing, and that is the secret of this crisis"" (191). This is a recurring theme. Plus, there are no female characters to speak of. One man's wife makes a brief and apparently unnecessary appearance for a page-long chapter, but that's it. All else is done by and to men.There are a couple of minor things I do like about the book. One is Salvor Hardin's statement that ""violence is the last refuge of the incompetent,"" which I like for its endorsement of nonviolent alternatives. Another is the characters' habit of saying ""Space"" or ""Galaxy"" instead of God when they exclaim or curse.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29579.Foundation

It was first published in 1953 by Gnome Press.Channis reveals his suspicions about the Second Foundation being located on the planet Tazenda, and takes the ship there. They first land on Rossem, a barren planet controlled by Tazenda, and meet with its governor, who appears ordinary. Once they return to the ship, Pritcher confronts Channis and believes him to have been too successful with the search. The Mule, who had placed a hyper-relay on their ship in order to trace them through hyper-space, appears, and reveals that Channis is a Second Foundationer. Pritcher's emotional bonds to the Mule are broken in the ensuing exchange between Channis and the Mule, and is made to fall into deep sleep. With only the two of them left, the Mule reveals that he has brought his ships to Tazenda and has already destroyed the planet, and yet senses that Channis's dismay is only pretense.

Foundation and Empire (Foundation, #2);Isaac Asimov;1952;256 pages, Hardcover;4.22;212523;Foundation (Publication Order) #2;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Classics'];Foundation and Empire tells the incredible story of a new breed of man who create a new force for galactic government. Thus, the Foundation hurtles into conflict with the decadent, decrepit First Empire. In this struggle for power amid the chaos of the stars, man stands at the threshold of a new, enlightened life which could easily be put aside for the old forces of barbarism. The Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov constitute what is very likely the most famed epic in all of science-fiction;Less episodic than the first (Foundation), which was a plus. But it makes all the more apparent Asimov's complete inability to create memorable or sympathetic characters. This means that each of the two halves read like over-long short stories. Part I is a suspense-thriller, solved by a ridiculous and anti-climactic deus ex machina, while Part II telegraphs its twist-ending so far in advance that the last few chapters are simply redundant. There's no arguing the brilliance of Asimov's ideas -- on science, politics, economics, war, etc. -- all of which come into play in these stories. But his writing itself borders on horrendous. Dialogue is unrealistic and the lovers' language in Part II was particularly stilted and corny, although this could have just been a product of being written in the 50s. Transitions are nonexistent, making some of the scene-jumps confusing at best. A simple empty line would have helped a lot to show the change of scenery (perhaps a problem only of the old edition that I read). Last, the aforementioned characters are poorly developed. It's one thing for Asimov to utilize his normal style of enigma/suspense followed by solution/resolution. This style works well for short stories even if they get monotonous after a while. But when stretched over 100 pages and combined with characters you don't care about, it makes for not much more than a mildly challenging brain teaser: interesting to be sure, but ultimately rather unfulfilling.All this would normally combine for two-star status, but I grant it a third in deference to Asimov's genius and the sheer scope of the enterprise he created with this series. He was clearly an idea man, worrying much less or not at all about the literary aspect of his works. I can respect that, even if it doesn't make for a very satisfying novel.Cross-posted at Not Bad Movie and Book Reviews.@pointblaek;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29581.Foundation_and_Empire

The Arisians, using advanced mental technology, have foreseen the invasion of their galaxy by the corrupt and evil Eddorians, so they begin a breeding program on every planet in their universe. Their goal...to produce super warriors who can hold off the invading Eddorians.;"I've heard people rave about how Doc Smith's work was one of the early space operas and that it influenced many later science fiction masterpieces. This may be true, but I'm thinking that just because it was influential, doesn't mean I have to like it. And I don't much. It's been pointed out by others that this book hasn't aged well, and maybe that's my problem with it. Then again, the Hardy Boys haven't aged well, and I still (guilty pleasure alert) like some of the series. But I read those as a child, so there's a bit of nostalgia that goes with my reading of the Hardy Boys. Not so with Smith's novel, Triplanetary. I wasn't a child when Doc Smith's first works came out, so I don't have that glittering/blinding cloud of nostalgia around his work, like the one that engulfs me when I read Hardy Boys.Maybe seeing Flash Gordon reruns at about the same time that Star Wars came out back in the '70s caused a rift in my mind, a gaping gulf between ""then"" and ""now"" (or what was ""now"" at the time). Pan Star Wars all you want, but the original movie is both derived from the old Flash Gordon serials and a reworking of the trappings in a beautiful and brilliant ""new"" (again, speaking relatively of time) packaging. I loved it, and still do. Flash Gordon is laughable, and was laughable even when I was a child. And because it's laughable, I kind of enjoy the campiness of it all. But I don't take it as seriously as it takes itself.And maybe that's my problem. Perhaps I went into this book ready to take it seriously, hence I was seriously disappointed. I can't look back on it and glory in the unintentional silliness of it all - the chauvinism, the absolutely terrible dialogue, and the deus ex machina (and here, I mean literally ""machine"") that jerks the plot in unlikely directions and destroys pacing. All of this makes for an agitating read full of overstimulus, like overdosing on cocaine or deciding, against all better judgement, that you should take the plunge off the 3 story tall water slide only to find that it wasn't such a good idea just as your butt clears the drop. Smith's attempts in this vein seem like a way to buy off, rather than reward the reader for patience. And I know not everyone wrote like that back in that day and age, so don't feed me the ""His writing was a product of the time"" line.The one aspect of the book that I did enjoy didn't involve the human characters at all. I actually quite liked the alien race, the Nevians. But the whole mess between Triplanetary (the human alliance) and these amphibian aliens could have been avoided, had someone just stopped for a moment and talked about the abundance of iron resources available in the asteroid belt. Why didn't anyone think of that? Can't we all just get along?!?So I finished the book. I can honestly say that. I won't be reading any more of E.E. ""Doc"" Smith's work, however. I've had enough. Too much, in fact. I can only be force-fed so many unlikely twists and perfect saves before declaring: ""Doc Smith is to hyperbole in science fiction what Monty Hall was to giveaways.""Still, I liked the aliens. At least they made sense. In fact, rather than destroying the galaxy, the aliens are saving a bit of the galaxy by keeping my rating of this book at two stars, rather than one.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444944.Triplanetary
The Martian Way and Other Stories;Isaac Asimov;1955;222 pages, Hardcover;4.01;4700;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Collections', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Fantasy'];This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov's ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances. Each of the long stores also shows his considerable skill in fully fleshing out a speculative scientific or social possibility.Contents:· The Martian Way · na Galaxy Nov ’52 · Youth · nv Space Science Fiction May ’52 · The Deep · ss Galaxy Dec ’52 · Sucker Bait [Troas] · na Astounding Feb ’54;"Still thinking like an earthling?Since time immemorial, Mars has always figured largely in Earth's mythology. And ever since the prolific imaginations of the likes of HG Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs first put pen to paper beginning the development of modern sci-fi as a genre, Mars, Martians, travel to Mars and life on a hostile Mars have continued to be favourite topics. With THE MARTIAN WAY AND OTHER STORIES, Isaac Asimov proudly continues this hallowed tradition with a series of four stories written in the good doctor's unmistakable and well-loved style.Despite its brevity, THE MARTIAN WAY explores a myriad of topics including colonization of an extra-terrestrial planet, acclimation of human beings to space and space travel, the politics and economics of life on another planet and its relationship to ""mother earth"" and even the development of earth-side prejudices to a people that are now considered foreigners.YOUTH tells the story of Slim and Red, two young boys, who have found two very strange animals. As any pair of young fellows might do, they hide the animals and feed and care for them to the best of their ability. They even dream about becoming wealthy by developing a circus act. The ending of the story discloses the surprise that the two animals are in fact the only survivors from a crashed alien spaceship (but ... and you'll have to trust me here on this one ... that is not a spoiler!) The REAL ending is a complete blind-side twist that only the likes of a twinkle-eyed fun-loving Asimov could imagine. I'll admit that the ending does seem somewhat artificial and forced but Asimov fans have long known that he loved his humour and always enjoyed tweaking his readers' noses. The joke is on us and even Asimov's silliness forces a reader to look into himself and investigate his self-centered notions of superiority.Unfortunately, many sci-fi authors have fallen in to the trap of creating aliens that are simply humans (or humanoid, to use one of Star Trek's favourite aphorisms) with only a bizarre variation on their outward appearance. In THE DEEP, however, Asimov has departed from that mundane mind-set and created a technologically advanced species with telepathic abilities that lives underground on a planet with dwindling resources. Teleporting an advance scout to earth to explore the possibilities of establishing contact with us and sharing our space on earth, the species discovers that the cultural, linguistic, physical and sociological gap between humans and their species is so vast that it could never be crossed. SUCKER BAIT, the longest of Isaac Asimov's novellas, deals, in a nutshell, with the potential rigors and difficulties of space travel, exploration and planetary colonization. An expedition to Troas, an earth-like planet located in orbit around a binary star system in the Messier 13 globular cluster, met with a mysterious disaster and failed to return or report back in any way. We are told the story of the follow-up expedition that was mounted to determine the fate of the original exploration. Although his tongue may have been at least partially inserted into his cheek, Asimov also uses SUCKER BAIT to cleverly discuss the potential pitfalls of ever continuing specialization in scientific research and the alarming and ever growing dearth of generalists and polymaths.The back cover of the edition I read asks, ""Still thinking like an earthling? Get out of your rut, open mind - there's a whole universe waiting."" I've got to agree. If you enjoy science fiction, then you'll enjoy this classic collection of four short stories from perhaps the finest author the genre has ever seen.

I’m not sure who E.E. Smith was sleeping with or what incriminating photos of the publisher he had stashed away, but this book is a stool sample. It started as a wonderful buffet of big ideas and interesting concepts. However, once digested and squeezed through the pen of Mr. Smith, it became eminently flushable. From a historical perspective, this book has a strong pedigree as the Lensmen Saga is the series most often cited as paving the way for large scale SF space opera.******(Note: That sound you hear is Mr. Asimov pffting that statement until his lips bleed). Thus, this series holds a place in SF history similar to the one held by LOTR in the realm of epic fantasy. However, that is where the similarities end and the suckness of E.E. Smith’s clunky, overwrought prose begins. This is a textbook example of a good concept and a compelling plot being torched to cinders by the inability of the writing to convey the story effectively. The prose is schlocky and kept an almost constant wince on my face. 
Samms thought, flashingly and cogently...for almost three hours, he went into the ramifications of the Galactic Patrol of his imaginings. Finally he wrenched himself back to reality. He jumped up, paced the floor, and spoke.”
 Put another way...‘Samms thought for a while and then spoke.’ 
They were amorphous, amoeboid, sexless. Not androgynous or parthenogenetic, but absolutely sexless; with a sexlessness unknown in any Earthly form of life higher than the yeasts.
 So, in other words...they had no sex.The above are random examples and are by no means indicative of the worst offenses in the book. I just wasn’t brave enough to revisit the most painful examples. Let me give you a quick plot rundown as it is really the only interesting part of the story.
PLOT SUMMARY
Super powerful good aliens, the Arasians, are in an eon-spanning galactic conflict with super powerful bad (and sexless) aliens, the Eddorians. Both races use surrogate/pawn races (including humans) to do their fighting for them. The bad (sexless) guys promote conflict and destruction while the good (non sexless) guys promote cooperation and brotherhood.There is a lesson/moral in here somewhere I’m sure of it. Anyway, the sexed up good aliens identify certain gifted individuals (starting with the titular character Virgil Samms) that have the ability to spur the formation of a peaceful, galaxy spanning civilization of awesomeness. These heroes, each referred to as a “lens,” are given a powerful device that allows them, among other things, to communicate telepathically across vast distances and read peoples minds. This newly formed “Galactic Patrol” of Lensmen then embark on a series of missions to thwart the plans of the evil, sexless Eddorians with the periodic aid of the Arasians. These missions include breaking up drug smuggling operations, spying on galactic “organized” crime, espionage and political intrigue, and space battles with Eddorian-backed bad guys. It all sounded great. Until, E. E. Smith wrote it down and killed it. By the way, written in the 1950’s, the LensMEN title is literal as “women” are too different “psychologically” to be able to wear the Lens. just thought I’d share that. 
MY THOUGHTS
I really liked the idea of the story. If this ever gets adapted for the big screen, it could be a lot of fun. But this book was an epic struggle to get through and that struggle is entirely centered around the writing, especially the dialogue. Now I like flowery, descriptive, melodramatic prose when it is well done. H.P. Lovecraft is a favorite of mine and he took melodrama to 11. Similarly, modern writers like Dan Simmons and Peter Hamilton amaze me with their ability to create a hyper sense of mood and drama through their prose. When done right it is a real pleasure. HOWEVER, when done poorly, like here, it is among the most painful literary experiences I can think of without drugs. This is bad melodrama...very bad melodrama...horrible cheesy-filled melodrama stuffed in a shit sack.Despite my pain-filled experience, I am giving the book 2 stars in appreciation for all it inspired in the genre that I love. I can see the vestiges of Smith’s legacy in many of the well-written stories that I enjoy. I’m gonna grant a star for that. That’s as far as I can go with this one.

It was the century's most important advance in space travel...and an experiment so revolutionary that only the men who huddled beneath the surface of Jupiter Nine were permitted to know its full meaning.Yet someone else did know--knew everything, saw everything, head everything--and was diabolically sabotaging the top-secret mission.Who or what the enemy was, Lucky Starr didn't know. but one thing was certain. The deadly force was not human...not even remotely human!;"This was the fifth novel in a series of six that Asimov wrote under the pseudonym of Paul French featuring David ""Lucky"" Starr and his sidekick John Bigman Jones. The first books were initially intended to be the basis for a television series but when that fell through Doubleday was happy to keep publishing them and Asimov was happy to keep writing them. By the time this fifth one appeared he regretted the pseudonymous publication, and his authorship became something of an open secret in the genre. Along with introducing Sirian antagonists, he incorporated Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. He pretty much abandoned the ""Space Ranger"" format, and had Lucky and Bigman become interplanetary detectives. The books were aimed for young readers and blended a strong action/adventure content with accurate (for the time) scientific concepts. This one appeared in 1957 and does not hold up as well scientifically as some of the other books; Jupiter was found to be different than 1950s knowledge postulated. It's still enjoyable, though; just pretend it's an alternate universe story. One has to remember that the social conventions of the series were conceived in the early 1950s, not just the science, and that Asimov was writing for twelve-year-old boys of the time. The Tom Corbett series by ""Carey Rockwell"" that Grosset & Dunlap published are similar, and I think David ""Lucky"" Starr and his feisty sidekick John Bigman Jones may have been influenced by Hamilton's Captain Future books, and perhaps even Superman. I didn't think the Starr books were as good as Heinlein's juveniles, but I thought they were at least as good as Andre Norton's, Donald Wolheim's, or Lester del Rey's juveniles of the time. And they're still fun stuff if you know what to expect.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/676158.Lucky_Starr_and_the_Moons_of_Jupiter

A Sirian ship then contacts Starr and informs him that the Sirians have built a colony on Titan and claimed it for Sirius, contrary to the traditional principle that inhabitants of one world in a stellar system have sovereignty over the entire system, even those parts without permanent settlements. Starr orders the pursuing Terrestrial fleet back to Earth; but returns with Bigman and Councilman Ben Wessilewsky to the Saturnian system.When several Sirian ships pursue the Shooting Starr, Starr conceals himself and his ship in the interior of Mimas; leaves Wessilewsky below the surface with enough supplies to maintain himself for several months; then takes the Shooting Starr back into space, where they are captured by the Sirians and taken to the colony on Titan. There, Sirian commander Sten Devoure threatens to have Bigman killed unless Starr agrees to testify at an upcoming interstellar conference on the asteroid Vesta that he entered the Saturnian system to attack the Sirians. When Bigman endangers himself by defeating Devoure in a duel, Starr makes a deal with Devoure: if he spares Bigman's life, Starr will testify that he entered the Saturnian system in an armed ship, and will lead the Sirians to Wessilewsky's base on Mimas.As delegates assemble for the conference, Agas Doremo, the leader of the neutralist forces of the Galaxy, tells Conway they should let the Sirians stay. While he supports the idea of stellar systems being indivisible, Doremo cannot see a way to get the Sirians out of the Solar System without a war, given the other worlds' distrust of Earth. However, should the Sirians remain, they might eventually overplay their hand, allowing for a new conference under more favorable conditions. However, he agrees to do what he can to support Earth's view should the opportunity arise.Doremo is elected to preside over the conference; the one thing both sides agree upon. Devoure admits that the Sirians have established a base on Titan, but insists that the fact that Saturn and its moons are part of Earth's stellar system is irrelevant: ""An empty world is an empty world, regardless of the particular route it travels through space. We colonized it first and it is ours"". Devoure then brings out Starr, who admits to having re-entered the Saturnian system after being warned off, and also that Wessilewsky established a base on Mimas.

The collection is bracketed with a pair of original amusing poems, but he had not yet adopted his persona of egotism and sexism and there are no autobiographical notes or introductions. Among the stories are The Feeling of Power (one of his most anthologized pieces; it was in my seventh-grade American literature text), The Last Question (which many people, including Asimov himself, felt was his best short work), I'm in Marsport without Hilda (an amusing Heinlein-like story), and The Ugly Little Boy (which proved that he could write good, convincing female characters.) One thing that's worth noting is that only one of the stories, Profession, appeared in John W. Campbell's Astound SF magazine. Asimov was known as a ""Campbell writer,"" but the other stories were printed in Galaxy, If, Venture, F & SF, SF Quarterly, two from Super SF, and one from Frederik Pohl's Star original paperback anthology series.

The book contains quite a few stories (24 in total), covering around 20 years of Asimov's short story writing (1950-1972). Moreover, this edition contains some autobiographical writing. Every short story is followed by a short essay (commentary) that has Asimov reflecting on his life, writing, publishing and relationship with editors. I quite enjoyed his autobiographical writing. It made me realize some of the things that might have influenced his Foundation and Robot series (fantastic series both of them, I was happy to make some connection with these stories). As for these short stories, their quality varied. Simply said, I enjoyed his earlier stories the least and his later stories the most.

Stephen King famously told about a rabid dog, filed up a novel with said rabid dog story, and it was actually pretty good.Robert A. Heinlein, is such a writer. Describing a far future world where the Earth is facing overpopulation and scarcity problems, one solution available to Terrans is to join up to be colonists.Our hero, leaping off the pages of Boys Life Magazine in Heinlein’s 1950 Scribner’s juvenile publication, learns that farming on Ganymede is much different than his agricultural chores on Earth. Heinlein demonstrates the charm of his juvenile work as he explores determination, family, perseverance and hard work.One of his better juvenile works this one earned a “Retro” Hugo in 2001.*** 2023 reread - One of his earlier books, first published in 1950, this is also a demonstration of his hard science sensibilities.It’s Golden Age Science Fiction, not the Andy Weir SF realism we see today, but for it’s time, this was technically challenging and thought provoking. And like many - most - of his writing, this tells a surface story while also delving into some deeper subjects.Right out of the gate we have some Malthusian economics and over population. How to deal with too many people folks needing some elbow room? Why, put them on a rocket and send them off to far Ganymede. But, isn’t that too cold? Sure, unless you terraform it! Hey, it’s 1950, have some fun.This was first serialized in Boy’s Life magazine and there is more than a passing mention of scouts and scouting and if you imagine a Scouts handbook but tailored to fit a terraformed colony fighting for self sufficiency, you can see some of the charm.One mistake many critics of Heinlein’s Scribners juvenile series (of which this is one) is to consider that these were written by a young man. Bob was 43 when this came out. Reading Grumbles from the Grave reveals how Heinlein’s homey delivery was carefully and artfully constructed for a book sales purpose. The author brought a good deal of real world experience to this work.The first half of the book was of the colonists leaving Earth and getting there and the second half is of the hard working and industrious folks taking care of business and dealing with conflict.Wonderful book.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50851.Farmer_in_the_Sky

Heinlein;1951;243 pages, Hardcover;3.87;5675;Heinlein's Juveniles;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Adventure', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Fantasy'];Don is a citizen of the Interplanetary Federation - yet no single planet can claim him as its own. His mother was born on Venus and his father on Earth, and Don himself was born on a spaceship in trajectory between planets. And he fights for the rights of this curious citizenship in very curious ways. Heinlein reveals in a dashing fast-moving style what can happen when politics - on an interplanetary scale - disregard the liberty of the individual. In the end, only the remarkable scientist-dragons of a rebellious Mars can resolve the conflict within a man who cannot live without the society that he knows is killing him.;Complicated and imaginative, very good.*** 2023 reread - Heinlein juveniles are so much fun.I recall that I very much liked this back in HS and then for whatever reason I have never reread this in 40 years. I did remember some scenes and of the story in summary, but this was a very enjoyable visit with crazy old Uncle Bob.As the story begins, Earth is a totalitarian nightmare with severely suppressed civil rights. Like other SF works during this time period (first published in 1951) the recent events of war and reconstruction have colored the perspective of our writer and dehumanizing authoritarian shenanigans are described.We find our protagonist with a unique legal status: he is a citizen of the solar system - The Federation - as he was actually born in space, the child of a mother from Venus and a father from Earth. His scientist parents are now on Mars and our hero has been given a package to deliver to his folks when all hell breaks lose as Venus declares independence from Earth and the Federation. His trip to Mars is hijacked and we then spend time fighting alongside Venusian guerrillas against the absentee landlords.Fans of Heinlein, and I am one, will make comparisons to his later masterpiece The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (first published in 1966) as that book described a revolution on the Moon against the tyrants on Earth. This was written for young adults and lacks some of the maturity of the later book, but the portrayal of independent minds and of the desire for freedom, as much as possible, is front and center.A very good book for the Scribner’s crowd but also an important work for Heinlein because if focuses on many of the political and philosophical themes he will explore in greater detail in many of his books following this one.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50854.Between_Planets
The Rolling Stones;Robert A. Heinlein;1952;Audio CD;3.89;7590;Heinlein's Juveniles;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Space'];"It doesn’t seem likely for twins to have the same middle name. Even so, it’s clear that Castor and Pollux Stone both have ""Trouble"" written in that spot on their birth certificates. Of course, anyone who’s met their grandmother Hazel would know that they came by it honestly… Join the Stone twins as they connive, cajole, and bamboozle their way across the Solar System in the company of the most high-spirited and hilarious family in all of science fiction. This light-hearted tale has some of Heinlein’s sassiest dialogue (not to mention the famous Flat Cats incident!). Oddly enough, it’s also a true example of real family values–for when you’re a Stone, your family is your highest priority.";"Robert A. Heinlein is a much revered name in Science Fiction. He won many awards, including several Hugo awards, and in 1974 was named the first “Science Fiction Writers Grand Master”. Sometimes he is referred to as the “dean of science fiction writers”, for his numerous novels and short stories. Although always emphasising scientific accuracy, he wrote very accessibly, and was one of the first American science-fiction writers to break into mainstream magazines. So how does this early novel, originally aimed at boy scouts, hold up? The answer, for me, is not as well as I had hoped.Space Family Stone by Robert A Heinlein, started life as a serial over four months, in the magazine “Boys’ Life”. This condensed version was published under the title “Tramp Space Ship”, and by the end of the same year, 1952 it was published in book form in the USA, as “The Rolling Stones”. Space Family Stone is its title in the UK.The novel was well received by critics and public alike. By now Robert A. Heinlein had established a good reputation for writing juvenile novels, in addition to his other writing, and these were in demand. George Pal’s cult film “Destination Moon” (a personal favourite of mine) from 1950, was also doing very well, and breaking new ground. It was the first major U.S. science fiction film to deal with the dangers of space travel and the consequent problems of America’s first lunar mission, involving the astronaut’s safe return. It is as well to remember that this event in real life was not to take place for another 19 years. Robert A. Heinlein was the film’s technical adviser, and the screenplay was based partly on his first juvenile novel “Rocket Ship Galileo” from 1947. He also published a tie-in novella, “Destination Moon”, based on the film, whose storyline also uses parts of his novel “The Man Who Sold the Moon”, from 1949, which was not published until 1951.Perhaps working in Hollywood on a Technicolour space exploration science fiction film drama had influenced his writing. At any rate, this is the first book of his to employ a jokey tone, and to be honest, the continual wisecracks wore a little thin for me, (though I am quite prepared to concede that this may be because I am English, and sense of humour can be tricky to cross cultures). I do feel that if I were now to watch the episodes of “Lost in Space” that I so loved as a child in the 1960s, I would wince in embarrassment, and find them sadly lacking. Space Family Stone has a lot in common with that TV series. Although it is about space exploration, it is a space opera, with all the action firmly revolving around a family. Robert A. Heinlein’s new wife Virginia had suggested he write about a pair of red-headed twins, and so “Castor and Pollux”, the 15 year old Space twins, came to be born. Frankly, I find these the two most irritating characters in the book, although perhaps they exemplify the American dream. They are fledgeling entrepreneurs, who, despite being high achievers, turn everything into a business opportunity.Other characters in Space Family Stone are the family matriarch, Hazel Meade Stone, a gun-toting grandma, one of the Founders of the colony on Luna. She seems to rule the roost without question, is “crazy as a skew orbit”, behaves like something out of the Wild West – and although the use of firearms is forbidden, she even wears a gun holster – although it is filled with cough candy.The twins’ rather ineffectual father, Roger, although possibly the least accomplished member of the family, skippers the spacecraft. And boy do we know it, as he increasingly resorts to variants on the theme of “I’m the captain of this ship and don’t you forget it”, whenever any of the Stone family appears to have an original idea, or become annoyingly enthusiastic. Their mother, Edith, a brilliant scientist and doctor, is a superwoman, who gets her own way by forever repeating “Yes dear”. Presumably this is intended to be droll. (It isn’t. Oh and by the way, she does all the cooking, although the other female members of the crew chip in when she is absent.)There is a daughter, whose part in the plot is so insignificant that I forget her name. She gets emotional at the drop of a hat, dreams about the hunky young men whom she might meet at various space stations, and sits knitting. Then there is the baby, Lowell, nicknamed “Buster”, who is an extraordinary child: a chess genius with telepathic skills. All three females look after the baby exclusively. Clearly he is intended to seem cute. I am not entirely sure when to say that certain aspects of the humour are extremely dated, that this family is annoying to the point of crassness, and that they seem to be stuck in their own little time warp.Of course in 1952, the dynamics of this family may not have seemed much out of the ordinary. The general view of “normality” has changed significantly, to the point that many of us question the very idea, and find a family setup like this one, distinctly trying. We also have to remember that this book is a satire, and as such, all the characters are exaggerated, and larger than life. (Oh yes, Meade is the name of the mimsy teenage daughter, the most old-fashioned of the lot.)Space Family Stone is the sixth of Robert A. Heinlein’s twelve juvenile novels, written primarily for younger people. The Stones are a family of “Loonies”, or residents of the Moon, which is known as “Luna” in the book. Largely due to the entrepreneurial twin teenage boys, Castor and Pollux, the family purchase and rebuild a used spaceship and go sightseeing around the Solar System. The action takes place on the moon, Mars, the Asteroid Belt, and around Saturn.There are engaging incidents, such as Castor and Pollux buying used bicycles on Luna to sell on Mars, their first stop. However, their inexperience means that they run foul of local regulations.  They are freed by their canny grandmother Hazel Stone. . The twins’ story is central, and is firmly focussed on business activities, rather than any sense of self-development; any concerns with wider knowledge, or imaginative exploration. The equivalent of a gold rush is in progress with people prospecting for “core material” and radioactive ores. The twins obtain supplies and luxury goods on Mars to sell at their destination, on the principle that it is shopkeepers, not miners, who get rich during gold rushes.Exciting diversions include a secondary story involving Edith Stone.  Her skills as a talented doctor are needed elsewhere, when an epidemic arises on a space station on the frontier. As a doctor, she is in constant demand, so for a good deal of the plot the Stone family are split up between different locations, allowing Hazel to take full rein. Also there is a very near call for this oldest member of the family, when Castor and Pollux inadvertently put Hazel Stone’s life at risk, by not recording up to date information about a long distance transport vehicle they had been tinkering with .By far the most entertaining story thread though, is the ongoing story about the “flat cats”. While on Mars, the twins buy their baby brother Buster a native Martian creature, who “had no discernable features, being merely a pie-shaped mass of sleek red fur a little darker than Castor’s own hair”. This was a flat cat, a creature who produced a comfortable soothing vibration, affecting anyone who held it. They called it “Fuzzy Britches”, and it was an instant success. “The child left carrying the flat cat and cooing a lullaby to it. Fuzzy Britches might lack legs but it knew how to win friends; anyone who picked it up hated to put it down. There was something intensely satisfying about petting the furry thing. Hazel tried to analyze it but could not.” Fuzzy Britches was a perfect pet … except that it had a feature similar to the Gremlins in the comedy horror film, which was that it bred exponentially, and rapidly the population threatened to take over the spaceship. .The idea of this may seem vaguely familiar to you. Perhaps you remember an early episode of “Star Trek”, called “The Trouble with Tribbles”. Apparently the show’s producers noticed similarities in the two stories and asked Robert A. Heinlein for permission to use the idea. He asked for an autographed copy of the script, but otherwise did not object, since he himself had credited a 1905 Butler short story “Pigs Is Pigs”, by Ellis Parker, as the inspiration behind the flat cats. Anyone familiar with the story about the Tribbles, may have an idea about a possible ending, but in fact the conclusion of the flat cats incident is less radical, and owes much more to the twins’ canny business acumen.  When the flat cat and its offspring threaten to overpopulate the ship, the family places them in hibernation in a freezer, and later the twins sell them to the miners.It comes as no surprise to me that one edition of Space Family Stone features a proto-Tribble-like creature embossed on the front cover, albeit with two eyes rather than the three it should have. They are far more endearing than the standard space-suited family, who feature on the cover of this edition (originally from 1969, reprinted in 1978). Oddly, at the time, flat cats were considered controversial, because of the asexual nature of their breeding. Apparently the flat cats caused a major disagreement between Robert A. Heinlein and his editor, who felt that they would cause librarians to become upset! Since librarians were a major influence on book sales at this time, this would never do.The novel ends on an optimistic note, after much drama, with the family setting out to see the rings of Saturn. It does seem a little weak, reminding us of the non-ending of a television episode, “to be continued”. Perhaps this is yet another indication of how much Robert A. Heinlein’s recent experiences influenced this novel.Whereas Robert A. Heinlein’s previous juvenile novels had focused around one key character, this time the plot is predominantly about a family. I feel it is this aspect which makes it seem so irksome, and heralds its downfall. By now Robert A. Heinlein had become a confident and accomplished writer, and we can recognise “the Heinlein voice”. Perhaps because of his recent experiences on film and television, much of Space Family Stone is dialogue based. This dialogue is lively and energetic, and in his characters we can see the beginnings of the bright and intelligent, Heinlein archetype. He does attempt to give each character a distinct and separate voice, but the tiresome snappy dialogue seems never-ending. It is frankly unbelievable that a family should continually talk to each other using such too-knowing, smart wisecracks. Perhaps this is a jaded, cynical, world-weary 21st century view, but I have to say that these characters, which are the centre of the novel, are so bright and overenthusiastic that they come across as just annoying.It is possible that out of all Robert A. Heinlein’s juvenile books, this is the one that has (so far) dated worst. This may partly be that the book is regarded as Heinlein’s first foray into a lighter, more humorous book. Apart from the fact that, as said before, humour is notoriously difficult to pitch correctly, what one person may find hilarious will not work for another, or in another culture, or at another time. Perhaps this seemed devastating witty to the American youth of the 1950s, but now it seems self-consciously stagey and clichéd.One worthy aspect, which seems particularly targeted to his youthful audience, is that Robert A. Heinlein tries to demonstrate how complicated and dangerous future space travel might be. There is a lot about mathematics in Space Family Stone, all to show us how complicated it would be to achieve any essential communication, including warning of potential dangers such as the transmission of disease. The point is drummed home. We might have reached beyond Earth, and out into the Solar System, but it is not an easy ride.Parallels are made with the gold rush and the Wild West. With no doubt deliberate irony, Hazel Meade sometimes spends her time using a Western-type drawl, and carrying what she actually refers to as “a sidearm”. Much of the book echoes the expansion of the American West, and Robert A. Heinlein’s view of the Solar System as something to be colonised, sits uneasily with me, and I suspect other contemporary readers. The Asteroid Belt is presented as a kind of frontier, and Mars is described in business terms, as over-commercialised and rather expensive. Is this really how we view a possible expansion out towards the stars?Another aspect of the novel that I found rather clunky, was the dumping of big chunks of technical information, all at once. Modern Science Fiction novels are frequently not free from this either, and many reviewers will say that they “skipped” the boring or highly technical parts of a novel such as Andy Weir’s “The Martian”. For myself though, I would not choose to read a novel where I needed to skim parts to enjoy it. Something must be mismatched to need such an approach, and in this case, I believe it is partly in the writing, and also with the benefit of hindsight. Information is always easier to read in the context of the story, and ideally should come about as a consequence of the plot, reading seamlessly, so the reader is unaware of any change, and certainly is not bored. Clearly Robert (and possibly Virginia) Heinlein had spent a lot of time working on this aspect, trying to get the technical parts right according to what was known in the 1950s. Readers were intended to get a realistic impression as to what the future pioneers would have to do, in order to travel into and cruise around space. However, from the perspective of the 21st century, all the mathematical details were dull, boring, and frankly now irrelevant, since the advent of computers. Technical info-dumps are always a bone of contention between enthusiasts of hard Science Fiction, and those who enjoy soft Science Fiction. When the information has become largely out of date, only a true classic can carry its audience along with it. This is, sadly, not such a book.However there are good parts, and in conclusion I will quote a description of the current age of the car, which I found particularly droll. The First Age of Technology, Robert A. Heinlein explains, consisted of transportation such as the ox cart, and the row boat. The novel is set in the Third Age of Technology, which was the Age of the Space rocket. The Second Age is where we are at present:“the automobiles of the middle twentieth century just before the opening of interplanetary travel. These unbelievable museum pieces were for their time fast, sleek and powerful – but inside their skins were assembled a preposterous collection of mechanical buffoonery. The prime mover for such a juggernaut might have rested in one’s lap; the rest of the mad assembly consisted of afterthoughts intended to correct the uncorrectable, to repair the original basic mistake in design – for automobiles and even the early aeroplanes were “powered” (if one may call it that) by “reciprocating engines”.A reciprocating engine was a collection of miniature heat engines using (in a basically inefficient cycle) a small percentage of an exothermic chemical reaction, a reaction which was started and stopped every split second. Much of the heat was intentionally thrown away into a “water jacket” or “cooling system”, then wasted away into the atmosphere through a heat exchanger.What little was left caused blocks of metal to thump foolishly back-and-forth (hence the name “reciprocating”) and thence through a linkage to cause a shaft and flywheel to spin around. The flywheel (believe it if you can) had no gyroscopic function; it was used to store kinetic energy in a futile attempt to cover up the sins of reciprocation. The shaft at long last caused wheels to turn and thereby propelled this pile of junk over the countryside.The prime mover was used only to accelerate and to overcome “friction” – a concept then in much wider engineering use. To decelerate, stop, or turn the heroic human operator used his own muscle power, multiplied precariously through a set of levers.Despite the name “automobile” these vehicles had no autocontrol circuit; control, such as it was, was exercised second by second for hours on end by a human being peering out through a small pane of dirty silica glass, and judging unassisted and often disastrously his own motion and those of other objects. In almost all cases the operator had no notion of the kinetic energy stored in his missile and could not have written the basics equation. Newton’s Laws of Motion were to him mysteries as profound as the meaning of the universe.Nevertheless millions of these mechanical jokes swarmed over our home planet, dodging each other by inches or failing to dodge. None of them ever worked right; by their nature they could not work right; and they were constantly getting out of order. Their operators were usually mightily pleased when they worked at all. When they did not, which was every few hundred miles, (hundred, not hundred thousand), they hired a member of a social class of arcane specialists to make inadequate and always expensive technical repairs.Despite these mad shortcomings, these “automobiles” were the most characteristic forms of wealth and the most cherished possession of their time. Three whole generations were slaves to them.” Now that description, so accurate, and cheekily on point, did make me laugh!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50848.The_Rolling_Stones

The impact of hope upon Worsal is something to witness.*There are little incidents like this one that absolutely undermine the ethical stance of the Galactic Patrol and the Lensmen.

The Star Beast;Robert A. Heinlein;1954;253 pages, Mass Market Paperback;3.81;7831;Heinlein's Juveniles;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Aliens'];Lummox had been the Stuart family pet for years. Though far from cuddly and rather large, it had always been obedient and docile. Except, that is, for the time it had eaten the secondhand Buick . . .But now, all of a sudden and without explanation, Lummox had begun chomping down on a variety of things—not least, a very mean dog and a cage of virtually indestructible steel. Incredible!John Thomas and Lummox were soon in awfully hot water, and they didn't know how to get out. And neither one really understood just how bad things were—or how bad the situation could get—until some space voyagers appeared and turned a far-from-ordinary family problem into an extraordinary confrontation.;Despite its juvenile status, I’m glad I didn’t read this novel as a child. It’s not that there’s anything in it that is particularly objectionable to children, I just really don’t think I would have appreciated it in the slightest. From the basic plot description, one could easily think this was a classic boy and his dog (though replace dog with star beast) style story, filled with heart warming moments of separation, reunion and everyone learning a valuable lesson… and indeed these aspects are a part of the story, but they are far from the whole. While the plot description makes it sound as if the boy and the star beast are the main characters, they share only about half the plot with two government officials who have to make constant calls over the legality of the boy owning an alien, whether the alien could be classified as a “human” race and whether or not the beast has rights. These colder “logical” moments are as much the heart of the story as the emotional aspects between the boy and his pet. I’m not sure kid me would not have appreciated this deeper narrative. Nor would I have likely appreciated the 30 page trial section, with its legal terms and lengthy discussion on rights… though as an adult I found this to be one of the more interesting sections and fairly comical.This is a story filled with moral shades of gray. Kiku and Greenberg (our two government bureaucrats) make decisions that are often questionable from a moral standpoint, but looking at a bigger picture it makes sense. This at times seems like Heinlein’s politics start showing through, but unlike some of his later work, they don’t subtract from the story. Here it feels appropriate and adds a sense of desperation, showing that this situation is much bigger than anyone thought at the start and the implication of the final decision from earth’s standpoint could change everything drastically. This is one of those situations where I really can’t expand upon this without going into spoiler territory, but let us just say that the presentation of a boy’s adventures with his pet are… very minimal in the grand scheme of things. While I appreciated this more thoughtful and more serious tone, it does make the novel feel unbalanced. The opening 20 or so pages feel like a parody of the giant monster films so popular during the 50s, then it goes into a rather comical trial, before becoming a brief adventure story, then something of an intrigue tale. It all makes sense in the context of the story, but it has a hard time balancing all these different tones and styles (some of which are far more successful than others). All in all, I don’t want to complain too much though as I found myself enjoying the story as a whole. There are many flaws, though it contains very few of my usual issues with Heinlein. Overall a satisfying read if you’re looking for a classic science fiction that doesn’t require too deep of thought.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175328.The_Star_Beast
Tunnel in the Sky;Robert A. Heinlein;1955;272 pages, Paperback;3.95;13974;Heinlein's Juveniles;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Survival', 'Classics'];A classic novel from the mind of the storyteller who captures the imagination of readers from around the world, and across two generations. The final exam for Dr. Matson's Advanced Survival class was meant to be just that: only a test. But something has gone terribly wrong...and now Rod Walker and his fellow students are stranded somewhere unknown in the universe, beyond contact with Earth, at the other end of a tunnel in the sky. Stripped of all comforts, hoping for a passage home that may never appear, the castaways must band together or perish. For Rod and his fellow survivors, this is one test where failure is not an option....;"Stargate! Minus all the gods and the missions and the ascension crap.Add survival, walls, and GOVERNMENT! Wooooo.... um... well at least the survival bit was fun. :)Seriously, this YA is still a very can-do Americana book, with a seriously heavy Liberterian bent, but I have no issues there. I love that crap.Still... I think I prefer Miles Vorkosigan's conception of the most important survival tool better. Tipping the invisible hat was one of Bujold's greatest inventions. But Heinlein had the same idea. Screw guns or even shoes, the one thing that any hardscrabble colony needs is the concept of a politics where people can actually work together, and that's what this book is really about.YA? Sure, more like New Adult in today's classifications. Are you civic-minded enough?As an adventure and a straight story, it's pretty great all the way to the point where they start voting, then my attention started wandering a bit. Still, some other crazy goes on and we flash forward to see how they all turn out and we even get a complete wrap up, so it's not like the tale went nowhere. It just didn't really do all that much for me. Plus, even though the women were all pretty strong and as can-do as the men, I didn't quite like how the old stereotypes came out in conversation... EVEN IF they were slapped down by a woman right in the group immediately afterward. I just hate the idea that women have to pretend to be men to be treated like men. It's just a sign of the times kind of story, unfortunately, but fortunately, there was very little of this kind of crap and Heinlein's stance on it is pretty egalitarian and equal rights and equal responsibility, so it's more of a me thing hating older cultural trends than a ""I blame Heinlein"" thing. Petty jealousies and toxic encounters in a closed group, indeed. Of course, she turned it right back and said the same thing about men in any closed group. It may not be clever, but it's true. I loved the whole stargate survival business and the worldbuilding that led up to it. That was pretty great. :) It's just the other stuff that made me knock it a star from my original review.

""Doc"" Smith";1951;306 pages, Paperback;3.98;3775;Lensman #4;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Space'];"The action in Gray Lensman picks up immediately where Galactic Patrol left off, in the middle of the battle to destroy Helmuth's Main Base and, it is hoped, fully end the threat of Boskone. After the base falls, Kinnison finds some clues that lead him to think that Helmuth was perhaps not the head of Boskone after all. The clues lead Kinnison to mount an expedition aboard the newly constructed super-dreadnought Dauntless, into the Second Galaxy where he thinks the true head of Boskone might reside. The Dauntless locates a planet under attack and comes to its aid, destroying the Boskonian forces and discovering that the entire planet is capable of going ""free"" (that is, inertialess, the method used in the Lensman books to achieve interstellar and intergalactic space travel). The Lensman returns to the First Galaxy with the space-faring planet and its grateful residents.";"Sometimes, I'm a fool. I thought, perhaps, that the ""so called"" golden age of sci-fi before Heinlein would be as painful to read as the old Jules Verne. I even tried to read the first ten pages of the first book of the Lensman of E. E. Smith PHD and cringed down to my soul. I was thinking that nothing would be worth the pain of reading this trash. And yet, all of my favorite past couple of generations of sci-fi authors swore by the old doc, and there are still generations of readers that are surprised and delighted by the stories. Heck, the fourth book is considered by some to be the 98th best sci-fi book of all time. I buckled down, gritted my teeth, and picked up the fourth without so much as reading eleven pages of the first three. I WAS DUMBFOUNDED. I was awestruck. I was plainly amazed and giddy in the reading of these little serialized bubblegum stories of sci-fi heroes. I'm too young to have watched Flash Gordon, but I understand the draw. I'm certainly old enough to have sat amazed through all the Star Wars at the inception. I've watched all of the original Star Treks, (not to mention every iteration after). I was forced to re-evaluate my entire internal consistency engine of sci-fi idea sources and lineage, and all of a sudden, the mitochondrial eve of sci-fi tropes (at least the best surviving eve) is FOUND. Now I understand. The light shines upon my mind. The great cosmic egg lights up like a big bulb.So I asked in a small voice... ""So the Lensman series is what encouraged the Green Lantern Comics into being? It also encouraged the biggest space operas? It took over as the sci-fi successor to all westerns and greek hero myths?"" And E. E. Smith replied, ""Yes, you dumbshit.""AAaaahhhh... ok... I feel like a moron now, but at least I didn't proliferate that weird-ass idea about galaxies colliding... whew... I'm back on my moral high ground again. :)I might just have to read them in order again and ignore, dutifully, the Really Bad Physics in favor of the Great Fun.Update:I can't get this out of my head: The proper term for the collision of two planets is ""Squishingly"".

The Door Into Summer;Robert A. Heinlein;1957;304 pages, Paperback;4.02;27488;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Audiobook'];Electronics engineer Dan Davis has finally made the invention of a lifetime: a household robot with extraordinary abilities, destined to dramatically change the landscape of everyday routine. Then, Dan was tricked by an unscrupulous greedy business partner and a greedier fiancee into spending thirty years in suspended animation, the long sleep, just when he was on the verge of a success beyond his wildest dreams.They never imagine that the future time in which Dan, a modern-day and future-time, Rip Van Winkle, will awaken has mastered time travel, giving him a way to get back to them, and at them, and get his revenge!.;"An enjoyable SF story from a Grandmaster.The novel's protagonist, Daniel B. Davis, was a precursor to Hugh Farnham and even Lazarus Long somewhat, though Long was introduced earlier in 1941's Methusaleh's Children. Actually, Davis (and others) are thinly disguised Heinlein: fiercely individualist, libertarian, technically savvy, hard working yet innovative, resourceful, wise cracking, and with a horn dog libido that would make a porn star blush. I wonder if Door Into Summer used some of the same notes and ideas that would later surface in Time Enough for Love? Door into Summer may be classified as a transitional book between the earlier juvenile works and his middle works (his apex, his high water mark) and then to the weird, time traveling and lusty later books. I think a better reviewer than me could even make the point that Heinlein had begun his ascendancy here.**** 2021 reread - I've thought about this wonderful book over the years and knew that it was time for a reread. Not sure why I stopped short with a 3 star rating last time but I've upgraded to a 4 star now.The premise for the title is that he and his cat had lived in an old farm house that had eleven doors. In the winter time he followed his cat to each, with the cat hoping to find one would open not to the cold winter landscape but rather a portal that would open to summer. This idea is repeated several times to show that one is looking for a good result, one better than even rationally hoped for.The premise of the book is fun as well. Engineer Dan gets swindled by his fiance and business partner and so he goes on ""the long sleep"". In the 1970 of this world, a person can be frozen to reawaken at a later time, while investments continue to grow with compound interest. When the sleeper awakes, it will be a later, more technologically advanced time and with a bundle of cash from a well managed portfolio. That's the idea but Bob has plenty of fun cooked up for us, including some more traditional time travel. Heinlein fans may compare this his short story ""All You Zombies"" and fans of Poul Anderson's time travel canon will also like this.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348.The_Door_Into_Summer

He answers a distress radio call from Peewee, scrawny rag doll-clutching genius aged 11. With the comforting cop Mother Thing, three-eyed tripod Wormfaces kidnap them to the Moon and Pluto.;My first Robert A. Heinlein work read and still one of my favorites.Heinlein produced his juvenile books for Charles Scribner's Sons mainly in the 1950s and these were what many consider to be some of his finest work. I’ve always thought that the period between 1957 and 1966 was his zenith, with good work before and after, but during this time was when he was at the height of his considerable powers.Have Space Suit Will Travel was first published by Scribner's in 1958 and so was a part of this high quality. Nominated for a Hugo award in 1959 (and what a cast that was! James Blish won for A Case of Conscience, and the other nominees were Robert Scheckley’s Immortality, Inc., Poul Anderson’s The Enemy Stars, and Algis Budrys’ Who?) this was on a short list of his best.Kip Russell wants to go to the moon. There begins a golden opportunity for SF in the Golden Age!Brimming with 50s kitsch, but in a loveable way, Heinlein appealed to his juvenile audience with a fun adventure story and to his growing older fans with some cool SF. Some of the more interesting RAH characters are here and also the beginnings of some of his more ubiquitous ideas like liberty, resourcefulness, self-reliance and determinism. My 2016 reread left me nostalgic and endearing, and more appreciative of his talent than before.*** 2024 reread - This early Heinlein book, part of the Scribner's juvenile series, has lost none of its potency over the years and definitely none since my last reread in 2016.This time I picked up on the powerful message brought to us by the Mother Thing and really enjoyed the Roman legionnaire from Spain.Maybe not one of his more thought provoking books, this one is a softball, but still good fun.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20417.Have_Space_Suit_Will_Travel

First published under this title in 1963.Heinlein gives us one of the earliest uses in science fiction of the ""generation ship"" idea, a huge spaceship transporting an entire community of humans to a destination so distant that generations will pass during its journey. And as Heinlein demonstrates, the origins of the community can become forgotten, misinterpreted, and otherwise distorted with the long passage.";An imaginative if improbable tale (or more accurately: pair of SF tales combined together to make a short novel) by Robert Heinlein, about a spaceship voyage to colonize another planet. The trip has taken so long that the people being born, living, having children and dying on the huge ship have lost all scientific knowledge about what the ship is and where it's going. To them, it is the world and the universe. The story of where they are from and where they're going has turned into a religion. For excitement, the normal people battle the mutant Muties -- but the leader of the Muties, the two-headed Joe-Jim, actually has rather more of a clue about what's really going on.Love the artwork, lol!I wouldn't recommend that anyone go out of their way to read this story, but if you like old-fashioned SF and Heinlein's stories from the period when they were only semi-weird, this is a fun and quick read. Joe-Jim's arguments with himself are one of the highlights.Written in 1940s + backwards society on the spaceship = women are pretty much nonexistent in the story, and when they do show up they're treated like servants (in one scene, a mouthy woman gets slapped down). Arguably it's realistic for this group of people, but if you're sensitive about this kind of thing, give this book a pass.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50832.Orphans_of_the_Sky

""Scar"" Gordon was on the French Riviera recovering from a tour of combat in Southeast Asia , but he hadn't given up his habit of scanning the Personals in the newspaper. One ad in particular leapt out at him:""ARE YOU A COWARD? This is not for you. We badly need a brave man. He must be 23 to 25 years old, in perfect health, at least six feet tall, weigh about 190 pounds, fluent English, with some French, proficient in all weapons, some knowledge of engineering and mathematics essential, willing to travel, no family or emotional ties, indomitably courageous and handsome of face and figure. Permanent employment, very high pay, glorious adventure, great danger. You must apply in person, rue Dante, Nice, 2me étage, apt. D.""How could you not answer an ad like that, especially when it seemed to describe you perfectly? Well, except maybe for the ""handsome"" part, but that was in the eye of the beholder anyway. So he went to that apartment and was greeted by the most beautiful woman he'd ever met. She seemed to have many names, but agreed he could call her ""Star."" A pretty appropriate name, as it turned out, for the empress of twenty universes.Robert A. Heinlein's one true fantasy novel, Glory Road is as much fun today as when he wrote it after Stranger in a Strange Land. Heinlein proves himself as adept with sword and sorcery as with rockets and slide rules and the result is exciting, satirical, fast-paced, funny and tremendously readable -- a favorite of all who have read it. Glory Road is a masterpiece of escapist entertainment with a typically Heinleinian sting in its tail.";"Re-reading my least favorite of Heinlein's works, because who knows? Maybe an older eye can shed some light upon this most shameful of tales rife with sexism, unabashed fantastical thinking (that works because this is a fantasy), or the fact that there *might* be a good reason why Heinlein only wrote one fantasy novel.Results of my analysis are pretty much the same as when I was a kid. Odd, that. I mean, sure, there's the fighting of dragons and lots of really cool swordplay, geometrical magical symbols and magic flying everywhere, and adventure, adventure, adventure, and while none of that is particularly noteworthy in a world literally overwhelmed with such things, there is a certain odd quirk to this novel that at once feels way out of place for a fantasy novel and later how it becomes almost the entire focus.It's a book about relationships.Not heroism, guts, luck, or doing one's manly duty.It's about getting in the girl's pants, discovering that she's playing him for the same reason, marrying her because of a sense of ""that's what men do"", learning she's a galactic empress in a high-tech interstellar kingdom, learning he's filthy rich, and then, even though he's ""wildly in love"" with her, gets bored within months and drops her to go back to earth and act like a screwed-up war vet, all the while obsessing over her, the fact that he'd just given up high-tech immortality and endless wealth, and he dropped her all because she's freaking old, too, and it doesn't even matter if she looks like she's in her early 20's and she's an empress that has been ruling for a long time. He's upset because she went out to sow her wild oats, and he was the result.Wild sexism is rampant throughout this novel. Absolutely. All on his part. He's pretty much the perfect example of ""do as I say not as I do"" idiocy that men tell each other about the women in their lives, and because this is a poor fantasy because it is just as fantastical to see this dipshit as a lady's man that all the chicks flock to, it IS a condemnation of such thinking, too.I mean, I think I'd have preferred to have read the book from Star's PoV, not Scar's. After all, she's out there playing the game and even offering this dipshit not just the world but her wonderful self, endless wealth, immortality, and the respect of a whole empire for the heroic deeds that he (and she) accomplished. She played the game as only a smart and sexy woman of 1964 could play it, hamming it up for the benefit of the idiot male and giving him what he expected at every turn. All she really wanted was fun and companionship and a bit of love. She'd already had three children and 50 born ex-vitro. She has experience, she's smart, and she's bored.It's just a shame that we had to follow along with this asshole, instead. If the novel had been written the way that Heinlein had written Maureen from Sail Beyond the Sunset, this novel would probably be a long-enduring classic. But it wasn't.I did like the full synthesis of other-universal conditions that changed the laws where certain tech isn't feasible but magic is. This makes the novel Science-Fantasy rather than standard SF, but I have no problems with it. It was nominated for the Hugo in '64 and Way Station won instead. That was a smart move. Way Station was awesome. :)I knocked off a star from my original review for all the reasons listed. It may be unfair to judge a work that is of its times this way, kind of like judging the men in Mad Men in the early 60's for their behavior by our standards, but it is what it is. *shrug* Let's see how some of my better-beloved Heinleins will hold up! :)";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50856.Glory_Road

What he hadn't expected was that when the apocalypse came, a thermonuclear blast would tear apart the fabric of time and hurl his shelter into a world with no sign of other human beings.;"I read an overly simplified summary of this book that went something like this: libertarian veteran saves family in fallout shelter, gets moved forward in time 2,000 years, goes into survivalist mode and then runs into an advanced civilization where black people are the chosen race and who rule over a racially determined slave system. Succinct. This could have been shortened, reducing the first half with all the survivalist development, moving faster to the more interesting second half when the protagonists run into the chosen. Heinlein took a lot of heat for this obvious allegory, but critics should remember that this was written in 1964 and he did take on some controversial issues; not just racism, but also sexism, alcoholism, drug addiction, and traditional family mores. Like Lazarus Long and Jubal Harshaw, in Hugh Farnham Heinlein has created a character who is an alter ego for himself and a vehicle by which he can espouse his libertarian and, in some respects, contrarian philosophies.This book was very influential, but Heinlein’s influence by H.G. Wells is also obvious as he borrowed heavily from The Time Machine. Not one of his best, but still pretty good.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50840.Farnham_s_Freehold

Heinlein;1970;512 pages, Mass Market Paperback;3.67;12306;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Audiobook'];Johann Sebastian Bach Smith was immensely rich, and very old. Though his mind was still keen, his body was worn out. His solution was to have surgeons transplant his brain into a new body. The operation was a great success, but the patient was no longer Johann Sebastian Bach Smith. He was now fused with the very vocal personality of his gorgeous, recently deceased secretary, Eunice, with mind-blowing results, for Eunice hasn't completely vacated her body... Together they must learn to share control of her body. Mind versus body, Masculine desires versus feminine appeal. And soul versus soul. And when a third soul joins them the situation becomes even more fantastic. . .;"...Heinleinwtf?what was this I don't evenI don't know where to begin.Okay, I can forgive Heinlein a lot. I forgave him for Friday, in which the main character (another super-hot polysexual Heinleinian wet dream) marries her rapist. By the end of his career, the Old Man was pretty much just churning out whatever wank he felt like. But he gave us Starship Troopers and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Podkayne of Mars (I know, that last one rarely makes anyone's list of Heinlein favorites, but I liked it), and a lot of other fantastic science fiction, much of which is actually teen-friendly and teen-accessible.I had never read this abortion, though. This... appalling distillation of the very wankiest, skeeviest crevices of that dirty old man's oversexed id, dredged from the depths of early 20th century gender stereotypes and shellacked with the 1970s ""free love"" aesthetic Heinlein had going on. The result is I Will Fear No Evil, in which a 90-something-year-old man has his brain transplanted into the body of his hot secretary and promptly turns into the girliest girl who ever spent most of a novel running around tee-heeing that she's not wearing any panties.yeah seriously did we take a left turn at Piers Anthony here?And it's not like Heinlein didn't have the writing chops to make this interesting, or that he couldn't explore mind-bending ideas, including gender reification which when he wrote this in 1970 still was barely out of the realm of science fiction.(But Ursula Le Guin wrote The Left Hand of Darkness in 1969 so Heinlein you have no excuse!)So, I already told you the plot. Johann Sebastian Bach Smith is a billionaire, born long enough ago to remember the Great Depression, but the book is set in the early 21st century. Smith's ancient body is only being kept alive by life support, so he arranges to be the ""donor"" in the world's first brain transplant operation. By sheer coincidence, his gorgeous young secretary, Eunice Branca, is murdered a few days later, and Smith's brain is transplanted into her body.So, a lifelong heterosexual male born almost a century ago exploring life in the body of a nubile young female. Could be interesting, right? Even if not handled precisely... ah... sensitively? It could still be a good story, especially in the hands of Robert Heinlein, who for all his faults (every single one of which oozes across the pages in this book) was a damn good storyteller.But I Will Fear No Evil is not a good story. It's an endless series of conversations between Johann and Eunice (who somehow still ""inhabits"" Johann's mind even though her brain is gone) about sex. Johann, without even hesitating, embraces the role of becoming a male fantasy, giggling frequently to Eunice that being a girl is so much fun! As ""Joan"" he goes about kissing, fondling, and screwing pretty much anyone who holds still long enough. But mostly men. Always the men. She strips and flaunts and teases and seduces because that's what girls are for — always with Eunice's wholehearted psychic approval, because Eunice herself, as she describes repeatedly in wanky detail, was also fond of jumping anything with a pulse, especially if it had a penis.Of course, all the men ""Joan"" is screwing around with know that it's actually their nonagenarian boss occupying that body, but none of them hesitate for a moment either. Just as Johann immediately accepts that he's now a girl, so does everyone else.I haven't even gotten into the spanking and the lessons on how women must always be super-hot and sexually available but never forget to clean the toilet and the impregnating herself with his sperm andyeah seriouslyEverything — everything — you have ever heard about Heinlein's ""problematic"" gender issues and skeevy sex roles is spread in stark glossy airbrushed glory across this book. I Will Fear No Evil is a course in anti-Heinleinism: ""Why Robert A. Heinlein was a Skeevy Old Man 101."" Everything you need to know about why he has so many detractors. Minus the alleged fascism and libertarianism, because the minimal worldbuilding is just another representation of a crumbling overpopulated socialist-capitalist state. There's a bit of Heinlein's usual ruminating about individualism, but then Joan is off to flash her pantyless bum to some other dude, and we're back to the main plot of the novel, which is how many different conversations Joann can have about sex in between having sex. Threesomes, foursomes, fivesomes, girls, boys, at least she didn't get around to bestiality but there was serious contemplation of incest and a tempting little thirteen-year-old...yeah seriously that is the plotHonestly, I wouldn't have hated this book quite so much (though I'd still have mocked the hell out of it) if it had a plot.For the love of Hugo Gernsback, do not read this novel if you've never read anything else by Heinlein, because I promise you'll never want to read anything else by him. I can't see how even the most ardent Heinlein fan could love this book. (I've read some of the 5-star reviews, trying to figure out what those readers saw in it, and... no, I still don't get it.)Heinlein wrote some great books. Even some of his really problematic books (well, they were probably all problematic in some fashion) were great books. But this? It made my skin crawl. And worse, it bored me. It. Stank. One.

For years, decades even, I have had a tepid reception for the later third of the Grandmaster’s work, from I Will Fear No Evil in 1970 to his passing in 1988, comprising seven novels.It was not so much that I disliked the novels entirely, they just were not my favorites (though I will need to reread I Will Fear No Evil since I did dislike that one).The change was a progression. I did like some sections of his work, but was turned off by his over the top concentration with sex, and just wrote it all off as old man creepiness. But I reread many of his earlier juvenile works and also the non-fiction collection Grumbles From the Grave, with letters to and from his editors and publishers, compiled by his widow Virginia after his death. I realized that the hokey delivery so representative of Heinlein’s writing was a carefully crafted facade to soften the impact of his world shattering ideas and to create an approachable and endearing homely narration.Rereading his 1982 novel Friday, I then realized that what I had earlier taken for dirty old man syndrome, was a wink and nod orchestration of satirical attacks on fundamentalism and conservatism. Heinlein was using his time tested delivery to serve up some HAVE AT YOU! to the powers that be.Heinlein’s 1973 novel Time Enough For Love (nominated for the Nebula, Hugo and Locus awards) was a lengthy conglomeration of shorter works tied together with a framing story about recurring protagonist Lazarus Long and some of his adventures as told to archivists who interviewed the “Senior” after more than two millennia of the old rascal hopping from bed to bed across the universe. When I first read this I liked the stories but glossed over the framing story. With my new approach to his later writing, I paid more attention to the “between the lines” story and really enjoyed it now. BTW - Long has been described as having red hair, freckled skin and a big nose. Some have opined that Heinlein tailored the look to resemble L. Ron Hubbard, but for my own reasons I have always seen him as looking like Jimmy Buffett, a lovable rogue.What Heinlein has done is quite amazing. He has taken many mores, customs, rules and even laws about relationships, sex, gender, sexuality, child rearing and family structures and tossed them on a heap, sorted through them, threw out most and settled on a stripped down version of what works and for practical, pragmatic reasons, eschewing any held together merely for religious or conservative philosophy. He then presents the new morality against the older models and comments upon what works and why, and in his inimitable libertine country doctor fashion.Then, he saves up his piece de la resistance for the end, an all out, no holds barred, attack on one of the most revered institutions in all of Western Civilization, in a time travel trick that would make Larry Flint blush.Highly recommended to Heinlein fans, SF fans and maybe even to modern readers who are looking for fresh ideas in unlooked for sources. ***Robert A. Heinlein was also a visionary who saw the trends of Western Civilization and expounded out into a foreseeable future, not just in terms of science fiction but also in regard to cultures, morals, sociology and ideology. Time Enough for Love demonstrates the fundamental attractiveness of science fiction, the eternal hope that things will get better. Dystopian fantasies aside, science fiction deals with the future, and that there are people in the future still carrying on everyday lives. At its heart, science fiction is about hope, hope that we’ll see a few more years ahead. Time Enough for Love goes one step further and introduces us to Lazarus Long (though he was in prior Heinlein novels) as the oldest living human, over 2,000 years old. Thus, Heinlein allows us to imagine an almost eternal existence, and without the need to live at night and drink blood. I like reading Heinlein because I like Heinlein, chauvinistic and militaristic as he may be; he is also a libertarian humanist who loves life and tells a good story. He’s not misogynistic, he clearly loves women and sees them as capable and wonderful people. Heinlein’s voice, whether Lazarus Long, or Jubal Hershaw, is that of Heinlein himself, his experience is cast upon science fiction of the future. The best thing about Heinlein is that he is a good writer, a great writer of science fiction.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/353.Time_Enough_for_Love
For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs;Robert A. Heinlein;2003;263 pages, Hardcover;3.39;3601;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Novels'];"From Grand Master Robert A. Heinlein comes a long-lost first novel, written in 1939, introducing ideas and themes that would shape his career and define the genre that is synonymous with his name. July 12, 1939: Perry Nelson is driving along the palisades when another vehicle swerves into his lane, a tire blows out, and his car careens off the road and over a bluff. The last thing he sees before his head connects with the boulders below is a girl in a green bathing suit, prancing along the shore. When he wakes, the girl in green is a woman dressed in furs, and the sun-drenched shore has been replaced by snowcapped mountains. The woman, Diana, rescues Perry from the bitter cold and takes him to her home to rest and recuperate. Later they debate the cause of the accident, for Diana is unfamiliar with the concept of a tire blowout and Perry cannot comprehend snowfall in mid-July. Then Diana shares with him a vital piece of the date is now January 7, the year 2086. When his shock subsides, Perry begins an exhaustive study of global evolution over the past 150 years. He learns, among other things, that a United Europe was formed; the military draft was completely reconceived; banks became publicly owned and operated; and in the year 2003, two helicopters destroyed Manhattan in a galvanizing act of war. But education brings with it inescapable truths--the economic and legal systems, the government, and even the dynamic between men and women remain alien to Perry, the customs of the new day continually testing his mental and emotional resolve. Yet it is precisely his knowledge of a bygone era that will serve Perry best, as the man from 1939 seems destined to lead his newfound peers even further into the future than they could have imagined. A classic example of the future history that Robert Heinlein popularized during his career, For Us, the Living marks both the beginning and the end of an extraordinary arc comprising the political, social, and literary crusading that is his legacy.";"Robert A. Heinlein (1907-1988) was one of the first science fiction authors I read and, by now in my doddering old age, I have read most (but not all) of his novels and short stories, a number of them twice. ""Friday,"" ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,"" and ""Glory Road"" are among my favorite RAH books, with ""Citizen of the Galaxy,"" one of the first Heinleins I read, remaining as my favorite Heinlein as well as one of my all-time favorite science fiction books ( ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" and ""Starship Troopers,"" widely regarded as his best novels, are NOT among my favorites of his!). This book was published in 2004, so, yes, it was published after RAH's death. It was written between 1938 and 1939 and was rejected for publication. Now it is considered Heinlein's first novel. But, as SF author Spider Robinson argues in the Introduction, it is not really a novel. He calls it ""a thinly fictionalized lecture series."" Sounds boring--and I suppose most readers, including SF fans, would find it so. You can understand why it wasn't published! I give it 3 stars and don't recommend it--except for Robert A. Heinlein fans. Then I would say it's a must-read. Because, again, as Robinson wrote, "" The seeds of many of Robert's major novels are clearly visible...The essential core of his entire career is implicit as DNA code buried in the pages of 'For Us, The Living.' "" For that reason, anyone with an interest in Heinlein might enjoy delving into this book and see where it all began! If, for whatever reason, you have never read any books by Heinlein, I would recommend ""Citizen of the Galaxy"" or ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" or, yes, ""Starship Troopers"" ( the book is far superior to the movie!).";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50881.For_Us_the_Living
Variable Star;Robert A. Heinlein;2006;320 pages, Hardcover;3.89;5900;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Space', 'Adventure'];A never-before-published masterpiece from science fiction's greatest writer, rediscovered after more than half a century.When Joel Johnston first met Jinny Hamilton, it seemed like a dream come true. And when she finally agreed to marry him, he felt like the luckiest man in the universe.There was just one small problem. He was broke. His only goal in life was to become a composer, and he knew it would take years before he was earning enough to support a family.But Jinny wasn't willing to wait. And when Joel asked her what they were going to do for money, she gave him a most unexpected answer. She told him that her name wasn't really Jinny Hamilton---it was Jinny Conrad, and she was the granddaughter of Richard Conrad, the wealthiest man in the solar system.And now that she was sure that Joel loved her for herself, not for her wealth, she revealed her family's plans for him---he would be groomed for a place in the vast Conrad empire and sire a dynasty to carry on the family business.Most men would have jumped at the opportunity. But Joel Johnston wasn't most men. To Jinny's surprise, and even his own, he turned down her generous offer and then set off on the mother of all benders. And woke up on a colony ship heading out into space, torn between regret over his rash decision and his determination to forget Jinny and make a life for himself among the stars.He was on his way to succeeding when his plans--and the plans of billions of others--were shattered by a cosmic cataclysm so devastating it would take all of humanity's strength and ingenuity just to survive.;"When the impossible happens - when a planet MOVES beneath your feet, and won't stop - when you look up on a gorgeous morning and see something huge fly majestically into the side of a tall building - when a man you buried shows up at your door with a six-pack - you're supposed to feel a primitive terror, a superstitious dread. It's in all the books. You pass out, or vomit, or your bowels and bladder void, or you howl. If the universe is prepared to CHEAT, you're screwed, right? The only other alternative is to decide it's all a bad dream or sustained hallucination and just go with it.Joel is 18 and loves Jinny. He wants to get married to her and start a family. The only problem is that they're poor. Only (SURPRISE!) Jinny is NOT poor - she's been lying to Joel. Really she's the granddaughter of one of the richest (if not THE richest) man in the solar system. Grandfather even says they can get married - but Joel's job in the company and his whole future is all planned out for him. Joel can't stand not being in charge of his own destiny, so he tells Grandfather to go Heinlein* and then heads off on a generation ship for a New Earth planet, Brasil Novo....I am very torn on how to rate this.Why, Carmen? Is it because Heinlein is a sexist?Ah, no. Although this seems to be a common idea. If you have come here for feminist rants on how sexist Heinlein is, you'd best go elsewhere. May I suggest http://miniver.blogspot.com/2004/02/i... or the excellent http://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comment... ?Please go and enjoy yourself, it's fascinating. :)But I was not ranting and raving about feminism while reading this novel. While undoubtedly Heinlein was very horny, and incredibly convinced that women crave marriage and especially babies, I didn't find this book to be offensive. Women were fine, Heinlein was fine, Joel was... interesting, but certainly not making me want to bash his head in. And you KNOW how much I love to rant about feminism, so...You might expect me to say something like, ""For a man who was born in 1907, Heinlein was surprisingly forward-thinking."" However, if you are familiar with my James Bond reviews, you know that I don't forgive people solely on the basis that they were born in another time.But that's so unfair, Carmen! Things were different back then, Ian Fleming blah blah blah blah....Yeah, I don't give a care. Go whine somewhere else.The only part that made me squeamish and upset was the fact that Joel falls in love with a female whom he meets when she is seven. SEVEN. Ew. I am very NOT with this whole ""meet your female spouse while she is a baby or child"" thing that seems to be very popular. It's never a man either, it's always a female child who later becomes Wife. This is gross and disturbing. It would be as if I met a man who I'd babysat when I was 16 or 18 - changed his diapers, made him eat his vegetables, wiped his nose - and decided to date him.Ew. Gross. I do not see the appeal at all. I completely don't mind the age difference - that's NOT what bothers me. What bothers me is knowing a child and loving a child and being part of a child's life, and then when that child turns 18, having sexual thoughts about her. (If those thoughts weren't there before.) It's very icky and skeevy.ALSO, it's double-icky and double-skeevy because Joel keeps talking about how Evelyn (the girl/woman he ends up with) looks just like Jinny (her cousin and Joel's ex-girlfriend). But a ""better and younger version."" Ew, ew, ew. That is so sick. Please excuse me while I vomit.I've seen a lot of books try to pull this crap and I've yet to find one that has given me any reaction except for instant disgust and revulsion. Aside from that, Heinlein and I were fine in re: women and sexual relations.OKAY, that huge ""BAD"" factor aside, let's break down more reasonable lists of ""bad"" and ""good.""THE GOOD: - Heinlein/Robinson is writing here with a kind of youthful teenage-boy outlook on life. Expect an extreme joy and interest in females, a need to make a lot of ""toilet humor,"" and a barely restrained exuberance for space and interstellar travel.Some may find this grating, I found it enjoyable. He made me laugh and smile a lot. - Spider Robinson clearly busted his ass writing this and piecing this together from whatever was in Heinlein's notes. Kudos to him, he did a fabulous job. - Heinlein has a fun, enjoyable, rather conversational style of writing (think Douglas Adams or John Scalzi). - There's gay men in this novel (although noticeably no lesbians... perhaps fueling arguments that Heinlein is sexist? Women must be sexually available to the male MC? Just a thought) and they realistic and touching marriages/relationships....THE BAD: - There were parts of this novel I had to FORCE myself to get through. Parts that were extremely boring. Heinlein really thinks that he's funny, and really enjoys hearing himself talk. Whole scenes, whole conversations were nothing more than Heinlein spouting his philosophies about life, love, and the human race. UGH. I was ready to move on with the plot, already. This happened pretty frequently, to be honest. - Joel is very much a Gary Stu. Not only does he play the saxophone, but he is one of the best saxophone players in the solar system! Oh, he's just a poor farmer from Ganymede, but by the end of the book (actually around the middle) he becomes one of the richest men ever!!!! That was very predictable, by the way. I called it about 50 pages before it happened. 99% of women are attracted to him and want to have sex with him. Joel is ""such a quick thinker"" and But I had also noticed quite early that I was usually faster on the uptake than most people. Unless the subject was me, anyway. I spent the better part of most conversations waiting for everyone else to catch up. Patterns form and combine in my mind like crystals reproducing at fast forward, sometimes so fast that even to me it seems like I skip whole steps in my logic process and just thumb to the back of the book for the answer.this leads him to many Gary Stu moments where he comes to startling and brilliant conclusions before anyone else does - solving problems and occasionally saving humanity. - Because of the Gary-Stu-ness of the protagonist, the book is quite predictable. It's simply the natural result of making your main character a Mary Sue or a Gary Stu. You know they will do x, y or z because of COURSE they are so smart/sexy/quick-thinking/talented that this must happen. Therefore, the book had very little suspense or excitement for me. - The narrator is supposed to be ages 18-24ish in this book, but he always sounds, speaks and acts like a man who is AT LEAST 40 or 50. I wasn't buying this whole teenager/young man thing. (Unless you count the 14-year-old-ish obsession with sex and fart jokes as mentioned earlier). ...Tl;dr - Overall, I would actually recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun, lighthearted space adventure. Heinlein is funny and enthusiastic - it's difficult not to catch some of this attitude reading this. On the other hand, the man does love to hear himself talk - you might get bored with his constant stream of philosophy and theories on human beings. And you're going to have to be okay with the fact that the protagonist is unabashedly a Gary Stu, practically perfect in every way.*http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50847.Variable_Star

Galmieu. Emegé]. Traducción The green hills of earth .. Este libro es de segunda mano y tiene o puede tener marcas y señales de su anterior propietario.";"In Robert Heinlein's short story collection, we get to read about a future history that never happened, where the Solar System is colonized by a bunch of ambitious, optimistic, happy-go-lucky space entrepreneurs. They cut corners, break the rules, and quite often get themselves killed. But it works. The American dream reaches the stars, or at least the planets.In the real world, manned space-flight reached its peak around 1970 with the Apollo landings and then stagnated. Reagan went into the blind alley of building the Space Station, ignoring all his science advisers. Under Dubya, the US had a goal to repeat Apollo (more or less) by 2020, but funding has been cut and it's almost certainly not going to happen. No one at NASA is surprised. I made a bet about four years ago with a senior manager there that someone would set foot on the Moon again by the end of the present decade. He said he hated to be so blunt, but he'd already decided how to spend my money.So here's the odd thing. The only manned space program which ended up looking the least bit like Heinlein's vision was the Soviet one. They had totally inadequate money and took a lot of risks, but they are still keeping it going. The US program became mired in a vast, inefficient government bureaucracy, and is slowly thrashing itself to death. Things are so bad that the US will soon have to rely entirely on Russian spacecraft to provide transport to the Space Station, unless there's a last-minute change of plan and the Shuttle is not retired next year.However could that have happened? I really don't blame Heinlein for getting it wrong, and if any SF writer managed to call it correctly I tip my space helmet to him._________________________________________________Do you know, I think I spoke too soon.

Ouesta frase sintetizza la tematica dei quattro romanzi brevi riuniti in questo volume, uno dei più significativi apparsi durante la cosiddetta «Età d’Oro della Fantascienza». Negli Stati Uniti dell’avvenire, le opposte forze del bene e del male si combattono sul terreno della facoltà parapsicologiche: sarà compito di una ristretta cerchia di giovani selezionati recuperare la perduta eredità dell’ESP e impostare la propria missione nel domani. Una giuria si trova a decidere su una questione di fondamentale importanza: quali sono i confini tra l’uomo e il bruto? Per viaggiare nel tempo è sufficiente «pensare» in un modo tutto particolare, che non è quello comune: certi viaggi, però, possono essere senza ritorno. L’avvenire della Terra dipende dal possesso di un microfilm: l’umanità del passato e quella del futuro se lo contendono, in una lotta senza esclusione di colpi che vede l’impiego di poteri mentali sconosciuti.«Missione nell’eternità» è uno dei libri maggiormente celebrati di Robert Heinlein, l’autore forse più prestigioso della fantascienza mondiale, uno dei «padri fondatori» del genere: e lo presenta ai lettori di « Futuro » nel meglio delle sue qualità narrative ed inventive.TitoliL'eredità perduta (Lost Legacy, 1941), romanzo breveAltroquando (Elsewhen, 1941), racconto lungoJerry era un uomo (Jerry Was a Man, 1947), raccontoAbisso (Gulf, 1949), romanzo breve";"The problem with Heinlein is that he's so readable. Ordinarily the ability to write compelling prose -- which is not actually a given, especially in hard SF -- would be good, but in RAH's case this often results in me being taken on journeys I really, really did not want to go on, and yet I find myself unable to stop. (See: anything involving incest, relationships with your underage future girlfriend, the entirety of Friday, and really I could keep going. And yet I am still trying to read most of his works.)This is a collection of four of his early short stories -- Gulf, Elsewhen, Lost Legacy, and Jerry Was a Man -- and really the only horrifying thing (other than the gender roles, which, okay, mostly aren't his fault, come on, it was the 30s or 40s) was the bit where I was expected to root for the supermen with superpowers and think they should automatically get to run the lives of us lesser mortals. Actually, no, I would like more evidence, please. But ""Gulf"" was a good spy story when it was being a spy story -- though not so much when it was rhapsodizing about the supermen. Or the pasted-on love story. Or whatever the hell Sapir-Whorfian regurgitated... stuff... that was in there about language. Heinlein's linguistics, man, I do not like it and he never got it right. Though, to be fair, all the soft sciences get hated on, as the middle of ""Lost Legacy"" has a really bizarre digression about how, in order for the SF-y stuff in the story to work, all of anthropology is clearly wrong. The characters, of course, agree. Well, okay, then. Sheesh.My favorite story was ""Jerry Was a Man,"" which I actually hadn't heard of before reading this book; I think it was the most compelling and least pulpy of the four. Also I totally want my own genetically-engineered pegasus, and I understand that this means I have completely missed the point.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50838.Assignment_in_Eternity

Anyone who is interested in early, classic sci-fi should also enjoy it but there are some quirks that are worth mentioning. Maybe a trigger warning or two.Heinlein is not everyone's cup of tea. Female friends who grew up more recently than myself are insulted by the fact that by modern standards he is pretty misogynistic. He is more than a little... off.... in his opinions about minorities, races and alternative genders also. He is inclined to have single prototypes of characters, his he-man male leads, his teenage super-smart but socially awkward YA girls, his super sexed not terribly convincing female leads... You either can bear with it all for the sake of the stories, which are good, or you can't.In the first story THE YEAR OF THE JACKPOT Heinlein's main character is Potiphar Breen (oh, yes, Heinlein also loves convoluted names) who starts out as a non-traditional Heinlein male lead, in that he is meant to be middle aged and balding, but transmogrifies into a Lazarus Long type along the way. 'These characters always include some fruity American slang, and with ""...dern tootin"" this box is ticked. This story is about the potential for a dystopian social breakdown, nuclear winter ect and it is a pretty good story, though it has dated significantly, and at times I was not sure what point he was trying to make. What with old maids at 25, and girls who never stop thinking about something unspecified that I could not make out and the quaint notion that anyone who engages is drag is an ""emotional cripple"". Written long ago enough that people still thought that lemmings suicided. Still, if you can get over such hiccups and read it as the historical sci-fi that it is, well worth it.BY HIS BOOTSTRAPS is a time travel gordonian knot which will be familiar to sci-fi readers and will hold few surprises, though it would have been ahead of it's time when it was first published. It is quite well done, though I do wonder if Heinlein intended the main character to come across as rather dumb (as he does) or not.COLUMBUS WAS A DOPE describes a future spaceship and has the cute (interesting but ugly) standpoint that only ""family men' can crew the spaceship, though their wives are allowed to come along as who-knows-whats it is basically a story about human concepts and assumptions, it has a punchy conclusion with a twist.The title story THE MENACE FROM EARTH is not about what you think from the title. It is a juvenilia style story which is very reminiscent of some of Heinlein's other juvenilia. We have the Heinlein prototypical super smart, teen aged girl who despite being IQ brilliant is otherwise awkward. The lurid cover art is MEANT to apply to this story, I am guessing, but the scantily clad Boris Vallejo style figures on the cover (who appear to be about to copulate while on the wing) have absolutly nothing to do with the story. The misogynism in this one is a supersonic cringe, from the fact that older women are (apparently) not able to be attracted to young men (oh, really?) to the following conversation;TMFF(The Mature Femme Fatale) ""I know, but we can't let men think they own us.""Teen girl ""I suppose not.""TMFF ""they do own us, of course "" Oh... ICK!!! I think I may have sprained an eyeball from rolling it too much during this story, though his concept of a lunar colony was interesting.SKY LIFT has a medical emergency on a far colony sending our hero boosting on a small ship at unsafe gravity / speeds to save the colonists with much needed blood products. A heroic style adventure which was well planned and put together but which has badly dated as attitudes to certain things have changed a fair bit. The personal sacrifice part was fine, but there are some questionable ethics behind some actions. Basically, it would make a good story for an undergraduate ethics discussion. Kind of a sci-fi variation on the Trolley dilemma.GOLDFISH BOWL is a great concept, set on Earth, with a variety of natural phenomena which are suspected by one academic as originating from an intelligence, though one clearly not human. This was a really good, very thoughtful examination of human preconceptions about intelligence and other species. The more intriguing to me as I had just finished a book about dolphin captivity. The ending tried to be too religious/philosophical, but aside from that it was good. Would make a great teeve series.PROJECT NIGHTMARE was a very decent PSI story, coming to you firmly from the middle of the cold war and America's obsession with Russia, but really good for all that. The final story in the lot is WATER IS FOR WASHING and follows the fortunes of one man when a massive earth quake on the San Andreas fault creates a rupture to the Pacific ocean and the water inundates Imperial Valley. (Of which I had not heard; thank goodness for google maps or I would never have been able to visualise this one).While I know I have read some/all of these stories before it was good to reacquaint myself with some of the early genera sci-fi stories. I do like Heinlein more than my criticisms would seen to suggest, he was way ahead of his time in many social ways. If some of his outdated attitudes cause an eyeroll or a bit of indignant vitriol, it is STILL worth reading him for the interesting ideas behind all of the stories.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50837.The_Menace_from_Earth
The Mightiest Machine;John W. Campbell Jr.;1934;217 pages, Mass Market Paperback;3.3;86;Aarn Munro #1;['Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fiction'];"From Ace's series ""Science Fiction From the Great Years.""A million light years from Earth, one solitary spaceship floats through a vast swarm of enemies. The ship was an experimental vessel from Earth that utilized a revolutionary new concept in space mechanics, developed by the near-superman Aarn Munro. The enemy vessels were wholly unknown to Mankind, for the new drive had taken the Terran vessel into an unmapped void, where not even the telescopes of Earth had ever penetrated before.The Mightiest Machine is one of the first great space novels on which John W. Campbell built the career that took him to the top of the science fiction field. It is a classic of Science Fiction from the Great Years -- the stories that made science fiction famous in the first place, and still rank as thrilling entertainment today.";I picked up this book in a used bookstore. I've seen the John W. Campbell award and knew that he is considered one of the greats of Science Fiction, but I had not read anything by him previously. So, I picked up this copy, from the 1950's, complete with a cigarette ad. I was not impressed.On the one hand, the writing is not really that good. I'll admit it is a fun romp in many ways, but there is never a problem that can't be solved by some new technology they just pull out of nowhere on a moments notice. Unarmed spaceship confronted by highly advanced evil bad-guy (literally demons) aliens? Invent weapons on the fly (including the main weapon based on a technology they claimed earlier in the book could not be used as a weapon). Too far from the sun to use the charging beam? Invent faster than light travel. The book is full of these instant inventions that solve every problem and are much more advanced than the knowledge of a very old and advanced space-going race. Sure, it's fun, but it's often cringe-worthy.But what really astounded me was both the blatant racism and the total acceptance of genocide as a solution to problems. Campbell indicates that the good-guy aliens actually came from Earth, as did the bad guys as well, Some that did not manage to escape into space after a war with the bad guy devil aliens crashed back onto earth. Only the ones who crashed in Europe remained pure, while those who crashed in Africa and other areas bred with the locals and were clearly inferior. It is an interesting look into the racist attitudes of the era.There are two planets at war, our ancient relatives and the devil-appearing bad-guys. The only solution ever considered is complete annihilation of the other species. They end up using a moon to completely destroy their planet and ships to eliminate any that may try to escape. Never once is the idea of negotiations even remotely considered. Completely genocide is considered a perfectly reasonable idea with no discussion at all. It is assumed that they are evil and must be destroyed. After all, they look like devils.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3198796-the-mightiest-machine
The Incredible Planet;John W.

""Avventura nell'Iperspazio"" si divide essenzialmente in due parti, la prima dove i terrestri incontrano una razza antichissima, scopritrice dei segreti dell'ibernazione dei corpi e capaci di parlare con il pensiero, alle prese con la possibile morte della propria civiltà, mentre nella seconda parte Campbell ritorna nuovamente alle (noiose) battaglie stellari, nella quale Aarn inventa nuove e sempre più terribili armi per sconfiggere una razza simile a dei rettili chiamata Seeset. Seppur scritto in maniera leggermente più fluente, rispetto al suo predecessore, ""Avventura nell'Iperspazio"" possiede purtroppo tutti i difetti propri dello ""scientismo estremo"" di Campbell. Tuttavia, è da segnalare che nelle parti più ""Startrekkiane"" nelle quali c'è di mezzo esplorazione di nuovi mondi oppure la fuga dalla prigione Seeset sono molto divertenti, mentre mi continuano a rimanere fortemente indigeste le borioso spiegazione pseudo-scientifiche piene di dettagli assolutamente inutili e spesso ridicole.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11482373-the-incredible-planet

The concept was simple; to make it plausible wasn’t – unless you were John Campbell.‘With this out-of-space drive they hightail it among the stars. They locate the fugitive planets of the Black Star… find a frozen cemetery-world of a lost race… then head out for another galaxy… and wind up in a knock-down-drag-out interplanetary war in the other galaxy.’-P. Schuyler Miller, Astounding Science Fiction";This book is in the public domain as it was written in the 1950's I downloaded this book from Librivox to listen to on the beach while I was on vacation. This book written in a style that harkens to the golden age of sci-fi is a gem. Its narrative style is fluid and colorful. The characters though a product of their age are three dimensional and extremely likable. The storyline stretches believability but doesn't break it. So then as our travelers glide between the galaxies we are not left questioning it. It is also a book that astounds with its inventive grasp of the future of material and power technologies that seem greatly advanced even from today's perspective. The Librivox edition is also exquisitely narrated. I highly recommend this book.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/525003.Islands_of_Space

It came from the void and settled on Earth, striking awe into the hearts of all who saw it. Its mission, however, was not conquest -- but a call for help! First contact was a job for the brilliant team of scientists, Arcot, Wade, and Morey. And what they received was an offer of an alliance against an invading foe so powerful that no known force could turn it back! John W. Campbell's INVADERS FROM THE INFINITE is a veritable odyssey of the universe, exploring world after world and uncovering cosmic secret after cosmic secret. Here is a classic space opera that may never be surpassed!;"As I am a life-long fan of ""John Carpenter's The Thing"", I wanted to try out my first John W.

In short: I am a whore for a sexy cover. Just look at that thing! A dragon-like monster wrestling with a rocket ship? And all that for forty-five cents? Take my money!The book seems to have trouble deciding to whom it's aimed. The awesome cover, the space-dog aliens, the rocket-ship-rattling space battles all seem to be shooting toward a juvenile audience, but all the wildly imaginative Hard SF might turn off that same audience. The prose is very competent, but the characters are just three guys with different names. The story itself is mostly forgettable as JWC seems to just be firing out random ideas as they occur to him rather than progressing the plot, or presenting moments of characterization for his leads.I can't say I'd recommend this book to too many people. Current readers of Hard SF tend to ""pshaw"" when reading about radio tube technology in space ships, while YA readers need characters that are more well-rounded and identifiable. It is an interesting look into the Golden Age of Science Fiction, however, and an early product of curiosity for fans of JWC, but I probably should have started my JWC journey with ""Who Goes There?"" (the inspiration for ""John Carpenter's The Thing"") instead. But how could I have resisted that cover?

The safest way to do it is to not get into the details of the science but to focus on the fiction keep the science very minimal. But the author exactly gets into that trap and gets let down.

Since then, its fame has grown steadily among the multitudes who have read the novel or seen the film based on it. Yet, along with almost universal acclaim, a host of questions has grown more insistent through the years:Who or what transformed Dave Bowman into the Star-Child? What purpose lay behind the transformation? What would become of the Star-Child?What alien purpose lay behind the monoliths on the Moon and out in space?What could drive HAL, a stable, intelligent computer, to kill the crew? Was HAL really insane? What happened to HAL and the spaceship Discovery after Dave Bowman disappeared?Would there be a sequel?Now all those questions and many more have been answered. In this stunning sequel to his international bestseller, Clarke has written what will truly be one of the great books of the '80s. Cosmic in sweep, eloquent in its depiction of Man's place in the Universe, and filled with the romance of space, this novel is a monumental achievement.;"The enigma of the Spaceship Discovery lost in Jupiter's orbit ( the setting has been changed from Saturn in the original book, to match Kubrick's film).

Clarke;1999;272 pages, Mass Market Paperback;3.59;26957;Space Odyssey #4;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Classics', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy'];The mysteries of the monoliths are revealed in this inspired conclusion to the Hugo Award–winning Space Odyssey series—“there are marvels aplenty” (The New York Times). On an ill-fated mission to Jupiter in 2001, the mutinous supercomputer HAL sent crewmembers David Bowman and Frank Poole into the frozen void of space. Bowman’s strange transformation into a Star Child is traced through the novels 2010 and 2061. But now, a thousand years after his death, Frank Poole is brought back to life—and thrust into a world far more technically advanced than the one he left behind. Poole discovers a world of human minds interfacing directly with computers, genetically engineered dinosaur servants, and massive space elevators built around the equator. He also discovers an impending threat to humanity lurking within the enigmatic monoliths. To fight it, Poole must join forces with Bowman and HAL, now fused into one corporeal consciousness—and the only being with the power to thwart the monoliths’ mysterious creators. “3001 is not just a page-turner, plugged in to the great icons of HAL and the monoliths, but a book of wisdom too, pithy and provocative.” —New Scientist;"3001: The Final Odyssey (Space Odyssey #4), Arthur C. Clarke3001: The Final Odyssey is a 1997 science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke. It is the fourth and final book in Clarke's Space Odyssey series.3001 follows the adventures of Frank Poole, the astronaut killed by the HAL 9000 computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey. One millennium later, Poole's freeze-dried body is discovered in the Kuiper belt by a comet-collecting space tug named the Goliath, and revived. Poole is taken home to learn about the Earth in the year 3001. Some of its notable features include the BrainCap, a brain–computer interface technology; genetically engineered dinosaur servants; and four gigantic space elevators located evenly around the Equator. Humans have also colonized the Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto. TMA-1, the black monolith found on the Moon in 1999, has been brought to Earth in 2006 and installed in front of the United Nations Building in New York City. It is determined that following the events of 2010: Odyssey Two and 2061: Odyssey Three, the Jovian monolith had sent a report to its superior monolith 450 light years away, and is expected to receive its orders toward humanity after the nine-century round-trip. Presumably, the monolith was empowered to obliterate the nascent biosphere of Jupiter, but needed a higher authority's approval to do the same with the technological civilization on Earth. There is considerable worry that the judgment, based on the monolith's observations of humanity up to 2061, will be negative, and the human race thus destroyed as the Jovian bio-forms discovered by David Bowman were wiped out (while making Jupiter a small sun to assist intelligence on Europa). Frank conscripts Bowman and HAL, who have now become a single entity—Halman—residing in the monolith's computational matrix, to infect the monolith with a computer virus. The monolith does receive orders to exterminate humanity, and starts a duplication cascade, whereupon millions of monoliths form two screens to prevent Solar light and heat from reaching Earth and its colonies. Due to Halman having already infected the first monolith, all the monoliths disintegrate. Halman uploads itself into a petabyte-capacity holographic 3D storage medium and thus survives the disintegration of the monoliths, but is infected with the virus and is subsequently sealed by scientists in the Pico Vault. At the close of the story, Poole and other humans land on Europa to start peaceful relations with the primitive native Europeans. A statement is made that the monolith's makers will not determine humanity's fate until ""The Last Days"".تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و یکم ماه نوامبر سال 2012میلادیعنوان: سه هزار و یک 3001؛ - آخرین اودیسه؛ نویسنده: آرتور سی کلارک؛ مترجم: پیمان اسماعیلیان خامنه؛ تهران، نقطه، سال1377؛ در288ص؛ شابک9644740394؛ چاپ دیگر سال1382؛ در308ص؛ شابک9645548063؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده20مبخش چهارم، و پایانی سری «اودیسه»ی فضایی، است؛ «آخرین اودیسه»؛ تصویری از هزار سال آینده است؛ دورانی که در آن، نوع بشر به صورتی ناباورانه، به رغم رخدادهای مرگزا، همچنان به زندگی خویش، ادامه میدهد؛ «آرتور سی کلارک» در «ادیسه سه هزار و یک» گسترده ترین و پیروزمندانه ترین نمونه های علمی تخیلی زمان را، به انتهایی شکوهمندانه، و فراموش نکردنی، میرسانند؛ «آرتور سی کلارک» در سالهایی که در حال نگارشگری بودند، چندین کتاب داستان، و ناداستان، و بیش از صد داستان کوتاه، و صدها مقاله نگاشتند؛ از نامدارترین داستانهای علمی تخیلی ایشان، میشود به: «پایان کودکی» و «دیدار با راما»، و «زمین امپراتوری»، و «دو هزار و یک اودیسه فضائی» اشاره نمود؛ «کلارک» که هم اکنون از ایشان، به عنوان پیامبر دانش، یاد میشود، در رمانهای علمی تخیلی خود، چندین مورد، از مجموعه های اختراع شده ی تکنولوژیک امروزین بشر را، که صورت واقعیت بخود گرفته اند، پیش بینی کرده بودندداستان، که از پنج بخش تشکیل شده، ماجراجوهایی «فرانک پول» را، دنبال میکند، فضانوردی که، بوسیله ابررایانه در کتاب «ادیسه 2001 (جلد اول سری ادیسه)» کشته شده است؛ یک هزار سال بعد، بدن خشک و منجمد شده ی «فرانک»، در کمربند «کوپیر»، بوسیله ی یک یدک کش فضایی جمع کننده ستاره های دنباله دار، به اسم «گولیاث» کشف، و دوباره زنده میشود؛ «فرانک پول» به خانه برده میشود، و در مورد وضعیت زمین، در سال3001، میآموزد، و …؛ «آرتور سی کلارک» در «ادیسه 3001»، بزرگترین و موفقترین سری «علمی-تخیلی» دوران را، به پایانی باشکوه، و فراموش نشدنی میرسانند؛ ایشان هوشمندانه، به هزار سال آینده، پرش میکنند، تا حقیقتی را، که ما اکنون درک میکنیم، آشکار سازند؛ «ادیسه 3001»، یک شاهکار حماسی آمیخته با واقعیت علمیِ خیره کننده، خلاق، و بنیانمند است، که تنها «آرتور سی کلارک» میتوانستند آنرا برای امروزیان و آیندگان بسرایندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/11/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 08/09/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63432.3001

Rama, ou plutôt son double, son clone, son jumeau : Rama II. Soixante-dix ans plus tôt, un mystérieux engin extraterrestre traversait brièvement le système solaire, donnant corps à cette fabuleuse révélation : l'homme n'était pas seul dans l'Univers. Et voilà qu'en cette année 2196, le scénario se répète ! Un deuxième vaisseau interstellaire, exactement semblable au précédent, se matérialise dans l'espace... L'humanité, pour la seconde fois de son histoire, envoie une équipe de savants à la rencontre du visiteur. Mission exaltante, bien sûr, mais les intentions des uns et des autres sont-elles aussi nobles qu'elles le paraissent ? Sans oublier celles de l'étranger : pourquoi la nef infléchit-elle brusquement sa course vers la Terre ? Que dissimulent les flancs de Rama II ? Des merveilles... ou un danger mortel ?;"So. Two stars. That’s a really low rating for me. Normally, if I really don’t like a book, I just move on with my life. But this one had elements that hit close to home for me.Sorry, I realize that I was just speaking Midwestern Understatement. What I meant to say was that this book is a tangible manifestation of my nightmares. Is this an awful book? No.Did I enjoy it? No. It frustrated me from the first page. From *before* the first page, actually. More than that, even. This book made me angry.But is it a bad book in itself? No. Which is why I’m writing a review of it. To explain this strange situation and to talk about the danger of sequels.***First and foremost, you need to know that this is a review of a sequel.For those of you who haven't read my review of the first Rama book, here's a link. This review will probably make better sense if you’ve read that.https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...For those of you who are too lazy to read and/or have a bizarre fear of clicking, I liked the first book. It's a very lean, tight piece of what I'd consider ""Classical hard sci-fi"" by which I mean there's a focus on the science, and an emphasis of plot over character.This sequel was written more than 15 years later in collaboration with a different author: Gentry Lee. From what I've gathered, I think it's safe to say that Clarke provided some ideas for this sequel, while Lee is the one who actually wrote the book.What went wrong:Ultimately, everything that made me dislike this book stems from the fact that it’s a sequel to Rendezvous with Rama. 1. Enormous stylistic shift from the first book.This book was much longer (more than twice as long) and much more descriptive than the first book. The structure itself was much more meandering, and non-linear. Now I don't mean to say that Gentry's writing is unpleasant. Honestly, his style is much more like mine than Clarke's is. So I can't throw stones.The problem is that it’s almost the opposite of everything Clarke did in the first book. Clarke’s description is lean to the point of austerity. And as I mentioned in my previous review, Clarke’s pacing and structure is so tight that it almost doesn’t allow room for tension. (Almost). The result is that this sequel doesn’t just feel entirely different. (Which would be a big enough issue by itself) it’s that when held up against the first book, this one feels huge, loose, ponderous, and slow. 2. Huge shift in tone. In the first book, Clark tells a story of humanity coming together and working against incredible odds to investigate a mystery. And by extension, improve the sum total of human knowledge.It’s true that some people in the book react with fear, but wiser heads prevail. The story was optimistic and full of heroes. This makes it a book that’s hopeful about the future of humanity. In the sequel, pretty much everyone is a bastard, by which I mean they’re motivated by self-interest. There are a few people that stand up to them… but that leads to an entirely different kind of story. A world where everyone’s a bastard except for 3 people isn’t an optimistic book. The other huge change in character deals with the cleverness of the characters. In the first book, the characters are really clever. When investigating the alien ship, the Astronauts move with great deliberation and forethought. They’re painfully aware of the fact that they don’t know what’s going on. They treat the alien ship with reverence, and are careful… well… not to be total dickbags when interacting with the ship. For example, when investigating the ship, they talk about cutting through walls so they can see the inner working of the ship or the contents of some of the structures…. But then they don’t, because they realize that that could be viewed as aggressive by the ship (Which has shown itself to be automated.) Also, when they encounter creatures on the ship, they decide *not* to try and capture and/or kill them. Because again, that would probably be seen as aggressive/destructive. In the sequel, when they get onto the ship, almost the very *first* thing they do is try to attack/capture one of the creatures they see. And when it goes wrong a lot of the folks are like, “Holy shit, who ever thought it would come to this?!?” Well, everyone who read the first book, I’m guessing. And probably anyone who wasn’t a total self-interested bastard, too. 3. Huge focal shift from the first book. The first book of the series was focused primarily on the ship itself. There were was some backstory to the world, and there was some information on the characters, too. But all of that was in service to the center of the story, which was about the aliens and the mystery of their ship.The sequel focuses on the characters themselves. There are twice as many, and nearly every character is a POV character at some point. And they all have backstories. And flashbacks. And ulterior motives that have nothing to do with unraveling the mystery of the ship.The odd thing is that I actually *like* this kind of book more. Character stuff is my bread and butter. But that's not why I started reading this book. I started reading this book for answers to the mysteries that were brought up in the first book. But honestly? This book kinda didn't give a shit about the previously established mysteries at all.And if you think I'm just being pissy, consider this:The original Rama was 243 pages long. But in this second book, the crew doesn't even get to the ship until page 170 or so. But ultimately, here's the real dealbreaker for me.... 4. It turns out Clarke wrote Rendezvous with Rama as a stand-alone novel.He mentioned this in his introduction. And when I read that piece of information, my initial reaction was genuine anger and disgust. As the opening to a three-part series that slowly unravels mysteries about a spaceship(s) and the alien race that created it, Rendezvous with Rama was a great book. But as a stand alone novel it has all the appeal of half a hand job. Half *dry* hand job. By a dumpster behind gas station. Now this might seem a little harsh. But it really isn't. There's an enormous difference between a story that doesn't give you all the answers (either because of subtlety in the storytelling or because the answers will be coming in future books) and a story that has no answers to give. The main difference is that the latter story is utter bullshit. This is what I mean when I said this book disappointed me from before the first page. What I found out in the introduction to this book actually made revise my opinion of the previous book, and lose respect for Clarke as an author. I’d assumed he was teasing us with a mystery. I’d assumed he had answers he was going to give us eventually.But he didn't. And that is a betrayal of trust. It makes me go back and resent the book that I'd previously enjoyed. It actually makes me want to go back in and change my rating of the book here on goodreads. (And I may. I'm not sure...)This is also what I was referring to when I mentioned that this book is my worst nightmare. It's proof that a sequel can be more than a disappointment. It can retroactively ruin a book you had previously enjoyed. And yeah. That's a spooky thing to me. And it lets me know that I'm right to be careful with my own sequels.I actually bought the third book of the series. But I'm not going to read it. It's a rare thing for me to give up on a series like this. But I feel ill-used by Clarke. And there are many other books to read....";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112520.Rama_II
The Garden of Rama (Rama, #3);Arthur C. Clarke;1991;593 pages, Mass Market Paperback;3.8;25913;Rama #3;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy', 'Space', 'Novels'];In the year 2130 a mysterious spaceship, Rama, arrived in the solar system. It was huge - big enough to contain a city and a sea - and empty, apparently abandoned. By the time Rama departed for its next, unknown, destination many wonders had been uncovered, but few mysteries solved. Only one thing was clear: everything the enigmatic builders of Rama did, they did in threes.Eighty years later the second alien craft arrived in the solar system. This time, Earth had been waiting. But all the years of preparation were not enough to unlock the Raman enigma.Now Rama II is on its way out of the solar system. Aboard it are three humans, two men and a woman, left behind when the expedition departed. Ahead of them lies the unknown, a voyage no human has ever experienced. And at the end of it - and who could tell how many years away that might be? - may lie the truth about Rama...;"There's a scene towards the end of the sixth Harry Potter book where Harry and Dumbledore find a small basin of water with a much-needed magical item at the bottom of it. The water is cursed, though, and they can't simply reach in and grab the item, nor scoop out the water; the water has to be drunk in its totality before the item can be attained. And you just know that water's going to taste bad. Think the purified essence of a thousand Domino's pizzas and then multiply that by three. Yes, that bad. Anyway, Dumbledore realises what has to be done and makes Harry promise to keep feeding him the water, glass by painful glass, and not to stop no matter what happens. Well sure enough it gets unpleasant, immediately they start Dumbledore starts begging Harry to stop, weeping and ranting; Harry meanwhile pleads, cajoles, and lies to his headmaster in order to get him to drink one more glass, one more glass, one more glass. Reading The Garden of Rama is pretty much like that: I'd promised myself I was going to finish the Rama series and so had to get through this book, and so I persevered through it all, shovelling page after page of toxic drivel down my throat no matter how bad it got.I'm afraid this review isn't going to have much structure or narrative flow. There were too many things wrong with the book to make this anything more than a long list of free flowing criticisms. Besides, the book didn't bother having any structure or narrative flow so feel free to pretend that my review itself is some kind of meta-criticism if you like.Where to start? Well, the title makes no sense for one. In Rendezvous with Rama the main characters rendezvoused with a spacecraft dubbed Rama. In Rama II an identical looking spacecraft, dubbed Rama II, came to the solar system to be investigated. And in Rama Revealed I assume the secrets of the whole Rama thing will be, well, revealed (although see below). So then, this book must be about some great big vegetable patch in the spacecraft, right? Alas not. A settlement built within the ship is christened New Eden, and they have plants and stuff there, but that's pretty much the only relation to any garden in the book. Maybe this first criticism is overly pedantic, but it seems the choice of title here was either overly mundane or meaningless.Next on my gripe list is the acknowledgements section (yes, we haven't made it to page one yet). Gentry Lee thanks his wife for ""conversations about the nature of the female"" since the book is primarily told from Nicole Wakefield's perspective. Indeed the first part of the book is told as excerpts from her journal. So does Gentry Lee manage to transcend sex differences in this journal section? Do his wife's suggestions seamlessly meld into a convincing catalogue of thoughts from a woman trapped in an alien environment and getting pregnant left, right, and centre? No. No, no, and no. Instead we get utterly bog-standard first person prose, except every ten pages or so there will be a cringe inducing paragraph along the lines of ""So my husband didn't put the toilet seat down today. What is it with men and not doing that? Huh? As a woman it really gets my goat. You know what I'm talking about ladies, oh yes."" I've no doubt Mrs Lee gave her husband numerous insights into ""the nature of the female"" but he hasn't used them to make a believable character, he's just shoehorned a few of these bad stand-up routines into the main text.And while we're talking about the believability of our esteemed protagonist Nicole, let me ask you a question, dear reader. If you had to start the human civilisation again from scratch, how many people do you think you'd need to ensure enough genetic diversity to make the new civilisation tenable? I seem to recall a figure mentioned in The Matrix Reloaded for the number of humans needed to rebuild Zion is twenty three. Stephen Baxter makes this a big plot point at the end of Ark and agonises that forty six people with maximal genetic variation might just be okay. A quick straw poll amongst my friends with backgrounds in the biological sciences reckoned that quite a bit more than that would be needed. There's evidence that the human population fell to less than 15 000 once, and that maybe 500-1000 humans could breed their way away from extinction. So, with all that in mind, how many people does Dr Nicole des Jardins Wakefield, hero of Garden of Rama, think are necessary to breed their way out of trouble? Fifteen thousand, like the actual human population after the Toba eruption? Maybe one thousand, which some research suggests is a safe minimum? Perhaps only one hundred and sixty as determined by American anthropologist John Moore? Or only one hundred, as suggested by my biology friends after three glasses of wine and two minutes to think about the problem? Maybe Baxter was right with forty six, or the Wachowski brothers with twenty three? Well, Dr Nicole, what's your answer? Two.I'm sorry, what? There are three adults on Rama at the start of the book — two men and one woman. Nicole and her husband Richard have two daughters at which point Nicole starts wondering about how her daughters are going to continue the species. Clearly they need a man, preferably one each. So, she decides, she needs to pop out a couple of sons. Luckily, though, ""one of [her] major areas of specialty during [her] medical training was genetics, especially hereditary defects."" Phew! Looks like she'll realise the futility of all this and stop dooming all these kids to a lonely future in space. But no! There's more. At this point of the book Nicole is 41 years old and worries how many more babies she can have. She decides she has to have a son and preferably with Michael, the other guy on Rama with her. So then the next generation will consist of two girls and a guy, all of them either half- or full-siblings. And obviously that's a genetically viable group if ever I saw one. To be fair, Nicole doesn't just want kids with Michael to get some more genetic diversity, that'd be silly, she also picks him because both of her husband's kids are girls, while two out of the three kids that Michael has had back on Earth were boys, so having a son would be pretty much guaranteed with Mike but nigh on impossible with Dick. And here was me thinking it was fifty/fifty with both of them.So Nicole tells her (emotionally insecure and already quite jealous) husband she wants to get it on with Michael for scientific purposes, i.e. so their daughters will have a half-brother to shag later in life. And then she's surprised when he gets upset. Aggh! Stop, Harry, I can't take anymore! Later, after having had two sons with Michael, Richard shows up and she has a third daughter with him. Her main concern? That she's already paired up in her mind her two daughters and two sons, so daughter number three doesn't have a brother to make babies with. Aggh! No more, Harry! Please! The folly of the whole thing is only pointed out to her later by her thirteen year old daughter, who decides to marry seventy-two year old Uncle Michael, because marrying her half-brothers would be incest. Aggh! Enough, enough! And on a tangentially related note, Michael's two sons with Nicole sometimes refer to him as dad and sometimes as Uncle Michael, and similarly they sometimes call Richard dad and sometimes Uncle Richard. Why?Part two of the book reveals the purpose of Rama, how it was made, and so on. Most of the big questions are answered, which leaves one major question: what exactly is left to be revealed in Rama Revealed? We don't yet know who the over-arching authority is behind the whole thing, but it's some alien or another and frankly I don't think ""It turns out Rama was built by Zylorgs from planet Herpes"" is particularly fulfilling. On the subject of Rama's mission, it seems fundamentally flawed. It's supposed to catalogue the spacefaring species of the galaxy by flying through star systems, luring these species aboard, and then taking them back to The Node. From there Rama is refitted with biomes to support larger numbers of these species and messages are sent to each of these species' planets to the effect of ""We're coming back, prepare a few thousand of your species to come and live on Rama for an unspecified length of time. Then the whole thing flies back around the galaxy, picking up these species for observation. Frankly this sounds like a rubbish way for an ultra advanced society to study other species, as proved by the fact that Rama only ""captured"" its three humans by a huge fluke.Rama's mission is only slightly less believable than Earth's reaction to it. The human race of the original Rendezvous with Rama has spread across the solar system and, excitable Mercurians aside, the biggest problem it seems to face is an overabundance of petty bureaucracy. Gentry Lee ruthlessly deconstructs this world in Rama II, with a huge economic slump occurring just after the first novel's events that sets Earth back a century or so and obliterates its space programme. By the time Rama II begins, seventy years after its predecessor, the slump has lifted enough for a mediocre space programme to exist, but the military still decide to destroy Rama when it comes near Earth. Their missiles are ruthlessly efficient at tracking the spacecraft as they try (and fail) to obliterate it, but in this book it's claimed that Earth had believed the craft was destroyed. Apparently they fired their nuclear missiles at it and then everyone started staring at the ground saying ""Yup, I'm so sure we destroyed that thing I'm not even going to look up and check.""So when Earth is informed in the 2240s, forty years after Rama II, that they need to send two thousand individuals to Rama, do they rejoice at the chance to redeem themselves, to fix past mistakes, to send their best and brightest to discover the secrets of the Universe? No, the shady council that rules the world decides it's all a hoax perpetrated by those pesky Chinese, so they send their best and brightest and a whole ship full of rapists and murderers to Mars. If there happens to be a honking great spacecraft in the vicinity of Mars then they'll board that, if not they'll start a new Martian colony. Of course they don't tell all these people going to Mars that they might end up in an alien spaceship until they're actually in the alien spaceship.Of these two thousand people it seems that about twelve are half-decent human beings, that's including Nicole, Richard, and some of their kids. Since the kids were in stasis for their entire teenage lives they all have to deal with being, essentially, a child in an adult's body. Gentry Lee obviously deals with this in a delicate and thought-provoking manner: Patrick is shy with girls, Eleanor is perfectly fine, and Katie becomes a nymphomaniac. Wow! Of these twelve normal people, half are unceremoniously killed in a scene near the end of the book, and the humans in the colony happily let a Japanese mob boss take over. No one seems bothered that there's little food, the weather system is broken, and a hundred other problems, because the mob boss starts a war with another biome in Rama. Such flagrant clichés can work if they're told well, alas that's not the case here.Despite the three hundred or so five star reviews here on Goodreads, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who struggled to find the resolve to finish this book. The editors apparently had the same problem. As the book goes on more and more typoes start appearing: spelling errors, punctuation where it doesn't belong, and so on. One of the few solaces I could take was that this book is trashy pop science fiction, not hard science fiction, so powering through its six hundred pages was not difficult, just unpleasant.With all that in mind, I'm now off to read Rama Revealed, hopeful in the knowledge that things surely can't get worse. Can they?";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112518.The_Garden_of_Rama

Clarke;1993;633 pages, Paperback;3.82;17194;Rama #4;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Aliens', 'Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Space'];Rama Revealed (1993) is a science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee. It is the last of three sequels to Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama by these authors. The book picks up the story immediately after the end of The Garden of Rama. The book follows the story of Nicole Wakefield and her escape from imprisonment left at the cliffhanger of the previous book.;"Along with garden of rama, this conclusion to the story , rama revealed is definetly my all time favorite science fiction saga ever. Even despite some uninteresting soap opera stuff at the begining, the finall 200 pages of this conclusion are the most satisfying conclusion i ever read to a space saga ever.This book ended and nicole des jardins stuck in my mind for months on end. Everytime i think of good scifi i remember the ending of this story.Not only garden of rama and this conclusion rama revealed are incredibly imaginative and totally epic in scope and detail, but all is grounded in unforgetable characters that i loved to accompany till the very end.Rama revealed has some imaginative concepts for a technologic ""god""if you want to call it that, while at the same time keeps everything grounded in rhe humanity of the characters.The rama series are the best spaçe adventure i ever read. I loved the sense of exploration, the hight tech lost world mysteries, not knowing what could happen next and always be rewarded by arthur clarke with more imaginative stuff ahead. And more, and more, and more.If you like books where you feel you're one of the explorers steping into an alien and fantasy book, then this is or you.The story is imaginative and does not waste any time pretending to act as a in your face political metaphore or something like. The rama series is pure mystery and imagination with great chatacters and an incredible epic ending.Instead of using a scifi story to be just a background for a plot that could have been set in any type of novel , genre or enviroment, arthur larke creates a story that wouldnt be the same if it was not just about exploring an alien giant spaceship. The focus here, was really the exploration and arthur clarke really did a magnificent work in taking the reader step by step into that imaginary space world wich is as a good and detailed as anything you ever read in fantasy.I keep wishing that someone takes these books to be adapted to cinema as good as peter jackon did with the tolkien material so far. In fact...peter jackson, if you're reading this...get this rama book series now please ! ;) Rama revealed is an extraordinary conclusion.The only thing similar that can compare to the scale of imagination in this final volume is the works of olaf stapledon, particulary the book, last and first men, which tell the story of humanity over a period of a bilion years.Arthur larke wrote a forward for one of the editions , and its clear that the rama novels were very much inspired in the best sense by olaf stapleon work.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112517.Rama_Revealed
Against the Fall of Night;Arthur C. Clarke;1953;208 pages, Paperback;3.97;4827;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Dying Earth', 'Classics'];ONE BILLION YEARS FROM NOW . . .Mankind has reached the heights of civilization. Men live thousands of years in perfect freedom and leisure—their wants are attended to by ingenious machines—peace and culture flourish in ways undreamed of in our time. And yet ... mankind is dying. The price of peace has been the loss of the needed human qualities of curiosity and drive—they have been bred out of the human race. So when young Alvin of Diaspar began asking questions, he was looked on as a dangerous freak, a throwback. But Alvin kept asking, kept looking, kept seeking out the truth ...... and what he found offered his people a dreadful choice—battle and destruction, or a new and richer destiny!;"3 – 3.5 starsHundreds of thousands of years ago (millions of years after our own benighted age) the Earth suffered a tragic loss in battle with beings known only as ""the Invaders"" and the apparently last remnant of humanity sits behind the majestic walls of the final human city: Diaspar. Here they while away their immortal days, a society of lotus eaters tended by the greatest machines ever conceived by humankind, living in pleasure, but also fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of the wasteland outside their walls, fear of the future. From time to time there has arisen among them a mind not founded on this culture of fear and indifference, but rather one prone to curiosity, courage and insight. Such a mind belongs to Alvin of Loronei, the last child to be born in the city of immortals, and a young man who thirsts for knowledge and adventure.Clarke crafts an exciting, and lyrically written, dying earth story in which young Alvin must overcome the obstacles of his own people and face even greater challenges in the wider world. Ultimately the fate of humanity and its future (should it have one) will rest on his decisions. I don’t want to give too much away and spoil the story, for much of the enjoyment comes from learning the truths, and falsehoods, of Alvin’s world through his own investigations. Suffice it to say that there is much humanity of the final eras has to learn about itself and its history and Alvin’s actions are likely to spell either a great new era in their development, or the final sputtering out of their dying life force.I have never read anything by Arthur C. Clarke, but didn’t expect this. My impression was that he was a much more ‘hard sf’ kind of writer, more interested in true science and plausible extrapolations of it, but here we have a lyrically written fable of humanity’s far-future days of decline. True, elements of science (or super-science) are important to the story, but they don’t outweigh the emotional elements of the tale, which are really what carry it forward. There is also a significant smattering of pseudo-science elements that I found interesting. I enjoyed the story, but sometimes Alvin seemed a little too competent (perhaps a smattering of the John Cambellesque hero here?) and I’m not sure if I ever believed he wouldn’t overcome the obstacles placed before him, but the future history Clarke has painted for mankind is an interesting one and this is definitely a worthy entry into one of my favourite sub-genres of sci-fi.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33841.Against_the_Fall_of_Night
Prelude to Space;Arthur C.

Because Clarke was a proud Englishman, (and because in 1947 the British Empire was more or less intact) the moon mission is a UK affair, with some help from their American junior partners.In this, his first novel, Clarke's style is didactic, almost to the point of being Gernsbackian:   ""As you know, the atomic pile heats the reaction mass to a temperature hotter than the surface of the Sun!""   ""I say, as hot as that?""  But you know, that's all right. This book was deliberately written to get people excited about space travel. Specifically, to show in meticulous detail that space travel was no longer the realm of science fiction, but of practical engineering.My speculation: when Clarke was a boy, like all boys of his time, he was exposed to penny periodicals of the ""Boy's Own Thrilling Ripping Yarns"" type. These magazines, according to George Orwell's insightful essay, were written to prepare young British boys for their rightfully deserved task of running an empire. It's my considered opinion that Clarke wrote this book to convince the next generation that they rightfully deserved the planets.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1106989.Prelude_to_Space
The Sands of Mars;Arthur C. Clarke;1951;229 pages, Mass Market Paperback;3.75;4705;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Space', 'Audiobook', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction'];Space writers holiday. When a celebrated science fiction writer takes to space on his first trip to Mars, he's sure to be in for some heckling from the spaceship crew. But Martin Gibson, man about space, takes it all in his stride. That is, until he lands on the red planet. Once there the intrepid author causes one problem after another as he stumbles upon Mars's most carefully hidden secrets and threatens the future of an entire planet!;We will get the obvious stuff out of the way first. “The Sands of Mars” was Arthur C. Clarke’s first foray into the science-fiction novel format after publishing a series of successful short stories. First published in 1951, it is a somewhat unusual offering within the greater Clarke canon, for reasons which we shall discuss in this review later. Now we can argue all day as to the dates of what constitutes the true “Golden Age of Science-Fiction,” but in my mind this book and quite a few of the others published in the early 1950s still fall within that nomenclature. Whatever the case, “The Sands of Mars” is an excellent novel of space-age adventure, part travelogue, part soap opera, and part love letter to the act of discovery and exploration as essential qualities of what makes us human. The plot is as straightforward as you will ever get. Science-Fiction author Martin Gibson (a very obvious stand-in for Clarke himself) is traveling to the colonies of Mars on board the newest commercial space cruiser Aries. As it is the Arie’s shakedown cruise, Gibson is the only passenger, accompanied only by the small crew of the gigantic spacecraft. There are a few comic moments when Gibson has issues adjusting to the reality of weightless travel, but he quickly figures things out and he and the crew begin to bond over the course of their months long voyage. There are a few on board adventures to be had, including the interception of a vital experimental medicine necessary to combat what the colonists are calling “Martian fever.” Gibson arrives on Mars having made friends with one of the junior members of the crew, Jimmy Spencer, who has an unusual personal tie to Gibson. Gibson soon settles into his role of intrepid travel explorer and reporter, sending missives back to Earth on a regular basis. The Mars colony itself is small, and contained within clear domes that have been terraformed to sustain human life. Gibson soon begins to get a feel for the colony, and manages to get himself into a scrape or two along the way. He finds a mysterious outpost during one of his travels in the Mars “outback.” He then seizes an opportunity to travel to one of the outlying cities on Mars, but the plane that he is flying on runs into a massive dust storm and crash lands. It is here where the story begins to take a turn towards adventure and mystery, as Gibson and his mates from the downed plane soon discover a new species of plant life on Mars, as well as a small colony of “Martians,” a reasonably intelligent animal species that sort of resembles kangaroos. Gibson ends up taking a sample of each new life form back to Port Lowell, the main city on Mars. He names his new pet “Squeak” in honor of the sound that it most often vocalizes. Along the way, Gibson finds himself drawn to the Martian colony, and he begins to think in long-term plans. But there are many unanswered questions. What is the nature of the odd outpost that he discovered earlier, and how does it tie into the new plant that he discovered? Are “Squeak” and his marsupial companions the only remaining examples of animal life left on Mars? What is the nature of “Project Dawn,” a much-whispered about but never revealed plot thought to be covertly run by the Mars Administration? What exactly is the relationship between Gibson and Jimmy? What secrets does Warren Hadfield, the gruff Chief Executive of Mars Administration hide? Will Gibson’s immersion into Martian culture cause him to “switch allegiances” and commit himself fully to the colonist’s causes? Don’t worry, all of these questions and more will be deftly answered by the end of the novel, but you will get no more spoilers from me. I’ll state for the record right here that “The Sands of Mars” contains some of Clarke’s most personable writing. Often criticized for his lack of characterization, Clarke paints some pretty deep people in this book. There are times when it almost feels like a soap opera in space as he traces all of the relationships down to their logical ends. The Gibson character mirrors Clarke’s own life to some degree, even down to the failed relationship with a woman in college that may explain the nature of his relationship to Jimmy. Clarke himself had a short marriage to a woman, and remained a bachelor for the rest of his life thereafter. Fortunately there is little in the way of sexuality in “The Sands of Mars,” so we can leave all of the “other” speculations behind and focus on the adventure and fun to be had as the book comes to its satisfying climax. What Clarke IS most often known for is his keen grasp on hard science-fiction ideas and his uncanny ability to forecast future technologies and societal trends. He’s a bit off base here, but not too far if you consider what we actually knew about Mars back in 1951. This is a far cry from H. G. Wells or Edgar Rice Burroughs. You will find no vicious Martian land rovers spouting deadly fire, nor will you discover scantily clad alien princesses idling lazily as heroes draw swords and heave their massive thews. No, what you get in “The Sands of Mars” is a reasonable portrait of interplanetary travel as it might have existed in the future, along with a bevy of other interesting technical details that hit or miss the mark in various ways. Clarke was certainly not short on ideas. And you can even see the beginnings of what would eventually turn Clarke from a “good” science-fiction writer into one of the all-time greats, a concept that I like to call “The Big Idea.” A lot of Arthur C. Clarke’s later works would enter into Big Idea territory. The transformation of the entire human race in “Childhood’s End.” The senses-shattering journey into the farthest reaches of the galaxy with a side shot of the transformation of the entire human race in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” The monumental first contact with an alien artifact in “Rendezvous With Rama.” These are the books that Clarke is best known for, and while “The Sands of Mars” harbors no such aspirations, you can still see the seed of Clarke’s grand ambition on display here. Personally, I loved this book. I’m not going to give it five stars as it never ramps itself up to anything of a major status. But I liked the cast of characters. I liked Clarke’s happy-go-lucky sort of British pluck that he infuses the entire story with. I didn’t mind that the whole thing read like a 1950s science-fiction travelogue crossed with a soap opera of epic proportions. At the end of the day the book just made me feel GOOD. “The Sands of Mars” is a prime reason why I enjoy Golden Age science-fiction so much. The idea that the universe was ours to explore, the grand scale, the epic notion that human beings could work together to achieve massive and far-reaching goals, the sheer OPTIMISM of the whole thing. Arthur C. Clarke and a number of other authors envisioned a world where anything was possible, and that sort of enthusiasm wasn’t lost on an entire generation of people who would eventually come together and place the footprints of human beings upon the moon. In short, “The Sands of Mars” is a tidy, fun read that never gets too far off of its path and will leave you feeling satisfied and happy after you have turned the last page. It’s a short step up from some of the “juvenile” fiction that Robert Heinlein was writing around the same time, and you could easily fit this book into the “YA” category today. Highly recommended for any Arthur C. Clarke fan and/or any fan of Golden Age science-fiction.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149063.The_Sands_of_Mars

There are spider-creatures on Mercury. There is life on Venus. And there is possibly intelligent life on Mars...and Humans are interacting with all of it. This seems to be set sometime in the 2080s as there's a reference to a ship which had orbited Venus in 1985 having had ""nearly a century since it's last trip.""I also find it interesting that Humanity is actively terraforming Mars in this book, adding considerable amounts of oxygen to the planet's atmosphere (so much so that some people are able to tolerate it for a few minutes without a breathing mask) and yet they are walking around and interacting with the native Martians who, as the book states, may or may not be the remnants of an ancient civilization.

There have been no wars for the last 200 years.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «زمین افروز»؛ «نور زمین»؛ «روشنای زمین»؛ نویسنده: آرتور سی کلارک؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: سال1994میلادیعنوان: زمین افروز؛ اثر: آرتور سی کلارک؛ مترجم: هوشنگ غیاثی‌ نژاد؛ تهران، پاسارگاد، سال1370؛ در312ص؛ چاپ دوم سال1373؛ موضوع داستانهای خیال انگیز علمی از نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 20معنوان: نور زمین؛ اثر: آرتور سی کلارک؛ مترجم: محمد قصاع؛ تهران، افق، سال1374؛ در215ص؛ شابک9646742769؛عنوان: روشنای زمین، توطئه در ماه؛ اثر: آرتور سی کلارک؛ مترجم: مهوش مجذوب؛ تهران، فرزان روز، کتاب روز، سال1380؛ در256ص؛ شابک9643210227؛در این کتاب، «کلارک» به تجربه ای تازه روی کرده اند، نویسنده داستان خیالی خویش را، با رگه ای از ترفند پلیسی درآمیخته؛ «استانلی کوبریک» کارگردان شهیر سینما، «کلارک» را اعجوبه خوانده اند؛ داستانی مرموز از توطئه در ماه است؛ داستان از زبان شخصیتی به نام «سدلر» بازگو می‌شود، که در ظاهر به عنوان حسابدار دایره ی ممیزی به رصدخانه آمده، تا چگونگی وضعیت مالی رصدخانه را بررسی کند؛ اما او در واقع مامور سری «سازمان اداره مرکزی» است و میخواهد دریابد چه کسانی، اطلاعاتی را از ماه به زمین مخابره می‌کنند، اطلاعاتی که احتمال بروز جنگ بین سیاره‌ای را در پی دارد ...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 06/02/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ 27/11/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1705748.Earthlight
The City and the Stars;Arthur C. Clarke;1956;255 pages, Paperback;4.08;34898;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy'];Clarke's masterful evocation of the far future of humanity, considered his finest novel.Men had built cities before, but never such a city as Diaspar. For millennia its protective dome shut out the creeping decay and danger of the world outside. Once, it held powers that rule the stars.But then, as legend has it, the invaders came, driving humanity into this last refuge. It takes one man, a Unique, to break through Diaspar's stifling inertia, to smash the legend and discover the true nature of the Invaders.;"The City and the Stars, Arthur C. Clarke The City and the Stars is a science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke, published in 1956. The City and the Stars takes place one billion years in the future, in the city of Diaspar. By this time, the Earth is so old that the oceans have gone and humanity has all but left. As far as the people of Diaspar know, theirs is the only city left on the planet. The city of Diaspar is completely enclosed. Nobody has come in or left the city for as long as anybody can remember, and everybody in Diaspar has an instinctive insular conservatism. The story behind this fear of venturing outside the city tells of a race of ruthless invaders which beat humanity back from the stars to Earth, and then made a deal that humanity could live—if they never left the planet. In Diaspar, the entire city is run by the Central Computer. Not only is the city repaired by machines, but the people themselves are created by the machines as well. The computer creates bodies for the people of Diaspar to live in and stores their minds in its memory at the end of their lives. At any time, only a small number of these people are actually living in Diaspar; the rest are retained in the computer's memory banks. All the currently existent people of Diaspar have had past ""lives"" within Diaspar except one person—Alvin, the main character of this story. He is one of only a very small number of ""Uniques"", different from everybody else in Diaspar, not only because he does not have any past lives to remember, but because instead of fearing the outside, he feels compelled to leave. Alvin has just come to the age where he is considered grown up, and is putting all his energies into trying to find a way out. Eventually, a character called Khedron the Jester helps Alvin use the central computer to find a way out of the city of Diaspar. This involves the discovery that in the remote past, Diaspar was linked to other cities by an underground transport system. This system still exists although its terminal was covered over and sealed with only a secret entrance left.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه سپتامبر سال 1993 مسلادیعنوان: شهر و ستارگان؛ نویسنده: آرتور سی کلارک؛ مترجم: محمدرضا عمادی؛ تهران، هرم، 1371؛ در 261ص؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20معنوان: شهر و ستارگان؛ نویسنده: آرتور سی کلارک؛ مترجم: حسین شهرابی؛ تهران کتابسرای تندیس، 1394؛ در 331ص؛ شابک9786001821790؛ چاپ دوم 1397؛در این داستان «کلارک» گام به دورانی میگذارند، که در آن دوران بشر به اوج توانایی‌های علمی، و پیشرفت‌های تکنولوژیک خویش رسیده، و به دورترین نقاط فضا، دست یافته است؛ اما خودپرستی و جاه طلبی بیمارگونه ی انسانها، آرامش کرات آسمانی، و ساکنان آنجا را نیز، سلب کرده؛ تا آنجا که اتحادی از موجودات فضایی، انسان را، وادار به بازگشت به زمین خویش میکنندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 21/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 20/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250024.The_City_and_the_Stars
The Deep Range;Arthur C.

He found it in the ocean depths when strangers defied death to give life back to him. Freedom to roam above and below the great waters should have been enough for any man - but Franklin was haunted by the memory of an echo.... an echo that could solve the oldest mystery of the sea....;Written in 1957, The Deep Range, is based on the Arthur C. Clarke 1954 short story of the same name, published in the April edition of Argosy magazine, seen here:The short story version was later published again in Star Science Fiction Stories No. 3, edited by Frederik Pohl, seen here: & again in an Arthur C. Clarke short story collection, Tales from Planet Earth, seen here:This isn't what most have come to expect from an Arthur C. Clarke science-fiction saga. It feels more like Robert A. Heinlein or, someone I can't quite put a finger on while writing this.Clarke proposes a near future world, whose seas are fenced in, by using ultrasonics, to create and procure rich plankton meadows grazed by herds of whales, now domesticized animals raised to feed the masses, like the cows and chickens of today. The story centers around Walter Franklin, formerly a space engineer. At the beginning of our story, Franklin has just been reassigned and transferred into a new career to an underwater facility, it's location hypothetically decided upon as, existing on Heron Island, Australia.His job is to now perform as a Warden of the deeps. It isn't easy for him to let go of his past life. The details of which I think you would want to learn reading it yourself. Learning to operate a mini-sub, it is his job to oversee specific designated territories using high-tech sonar equipment to govern and control daily aspects of his job as well as any unforeseen occurances. Other engineers are assigned their own territories in rotating scheduled shifts. There is an oldschool sci-fi feel to the fresh ideas here that can be fascinating, in both dark and light speculations, to our own real future. The parallels to our world are some of the highlights of this adventure. The real grabber, however, may be that through the demanding daily routines of Walter Franklin's new life, somewhere deep below in the bottom depths of the ocean, lies a mystery or two that may not be at the story's center-piece but, is Arthur C. Clarke writing, what is essentially, one of the first cryptid adventures. Yes. This novel has giant sea creatures. And not just whales. What are they, exactly? ♫ I'm not going to tell you ♬The ratings by reviewers for this book are up & down and all over the richter scale. I give it 5 stars for having been fully engaged with this science-fiction world, and one that, I not only believed could be possible but, felt I had been transported to, and really cared about. It's true that it is not a high-octane modern tech-thriller but it was fun and for me, both, rewarding and one I will come back to.Though not as brilliant, The Deep Range inspired two time Hugo Award-winning writer, Allen Steele, to write a tribute of sorts called, Oceanspace, pictured here:* The edition pictured to the left of my review is not the edition I own.

Imperial Earth;Arthur C. Clarke;1975;320 pages, Paperback;3.74;6793;;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Space', 'Fantasy'];Imperial Earth is the fascinating odyssey of Duncan Makenzie, traveling from Titan, a moon of Saturn, to Earth, as a diplomatic guest of the United States for the celebration of its Quincentennial in the year 2276. Titan, an independent republic, was originally colonized from Earth three generations earlier. Duncan's initial challenge is to prepare, physically and intellectually, for the 500-million-mile trip to Earth. Once there, he is caught up in a sweep of new experiences, including the social and political whirl in Washington, a strange visit to a carefully preserved ancient city once prominent in the 20th century, and a search for and meeting with a woman he loved since she visited Titan years before.;This book is chockful of twists and surprises. At the beginning it looked like nothing more than an exuberant, gratuitous, though admittedly juicy, narration of life on Titan, the biggest of Saturn's moons. Clarke's description of hydrocarbon clouds and ammonia snow, the rose-tinted atmosphere and the wax formation that wraps around lukewarm volcanic effluvium is mesmerizing, as is his characters, the Makenzie twins, separated by decades, because they are clones. Add to that the fact that book was written in the seventies and yet it had predicted such things as palmtop organizer and the internet, and the kind of propulsion engine powered by mini black holes, the kind only mentioned in the Star Trek series so far. Add to that pentominoes, polyominoes, joy stick, null-G sex and asymptotic drive, and you have your perfect recipe of a jolly romp in space. Still it didn't seem to promise much beyond mere advertisement on life on Titan, and I admitted to a slight feeling of disappointment.But then on the 500th anniversary of the USA, Duncan Makenzie was invited to give a speech before the assembled representatives of Earth and its colonies. The story switched to the vivid, poignant exploration of an estranged home by Duncan, who not only has to train hard to acclimatize himself to Earth's stronger gravity, but also meets his first horse (...First Monster from Outer Space.... Understandably, since the horse is a Percheron weighing upwards of a thousand kilos, bred in the past to carry fully-armored knights), his first butterfly (an exuberant--no, arrogant--loveliness, is first taste of honey, his first underwater murderThen suddenly, with the sudden appearance of a gemologist, it seemed that the book had turned into a whodunit, full of mysterious, exotic things like titanite being smuggled and a friend slash ex-lover falling off radio telescopes. And yet, in the end, the book gives another twist, a profound, unutterably grand, and yet chillingly frightening, capped with a speech rife with courage and heroism it would've made Abe Lincoln proud.As usual Clarke presented his readers with solid science and a healthy dollop of dry humor, but also as usual, he staggered the mind with a vision of such mindstopping scope and scale.

Time Reborn
 a few weeks ago, I happened to run into the following passage, which I imagine must have occupied the author’s attention for all of two minutes. He is talking about gravity:Newton, according to legend, had this epiphany while sitting in his garden noticing apples falling from a tree as he contemplated the motion of the moon. To complete the thought, he asked another crucial question: How does that force decrease with the distance between the objects? For decrease it must, otherwise we would be pulled upward to the sun rather than downward to Earth.Now I’m not questioning the obvious fact that the force of gravity decreases with distance, but is Smolin’s argument valid? My reasoning was that we're in orbit around the Sun, so it shouldn't matter very much if the Sun's gravitational pull is stronger. I even remembered Jupiter Five, an SF short story in this collection by Arthur C. Clarke, which hinged on that exact question. They are on Jupiter V, a small satellite near Jupiter. The gravitational attraction of Jupiter is much stronger than the gravitational attraction of the satellite. Yet even when they push themselves gently away from the satellite and drift into nearby space, they are in no danger of falling into the nearby planet. There was a long, complicated and rather amusing discussion, which Not is threatening to write up in detail, so I won’t spoil her fun. But here, at any rate, is the final analysis of the situation which I arrived at; it’s quite fitting in a way, since Clarke, according to this page, dedicated the short story to the astronomer G.C. McVittie, for drawing up ""twenty to thirty pages of orbital calculations"". My own efforts are far more modest, but read on.So let’s try and write down some equations; it soon becomes clear just how odd the ""constant gravity"" scenario is. Suppose that, instead of the usual formula (1) F = GMm/r²you have a force given by(2) F = G'Mmfor some G'.Suppose the Earth is in a circular orbit around the Sun, and compare the normal case with (1) against the ""constant"" case with (2). (First peculiarity: the orbit has to be circular rather than elliptical. But it's going to get much weirder). Let R be the radius of the Earth's orbit, M be the mass of the Sun and m be the mass of the Earth.In the ""normal"" case (1), we have that the gravitational force acting on the Earth isF = GMm/R²so the acceleration of the Earth towards the Sun isA = GM/R²In the ""constant"" case (2), we need exactly the same acceleration to keep the Earth in its orbit, soG'M = GM/R²henceG' = G/R²Now what acceleration does a person on the surface of the Earth experience? In both cases, there are three things to consider: the gravitational pull towards the Sun, the gravitational pull towards the center of the Earth, and the fact that they are in an accelerating frame of reference since they are moving in a circle. Irrespective of whether we have case (1) or case (2), the third term is going to be the same. We can reasonably assume the second term will also be the same. So the only difference will be in the first term, the gravitational pull towards the Sun.Think about the situation at noon (observer nearest to the Sun). In case (2), where we have a constant force, their acceleration towards the Sun is stillA₂ = G'M = GM/R²But in case (1), their acceleration towards the Sun isA₁ = GM/(R-r)²We haveA₂/A₁ = (R-r)²/R²=~ 1 - 2r/R assuming r/R is small.So the change in gravity at noon in the ""constant gravity"" world will be approximately-2Ar/Rwhere A is the gravitational acceleration towards the Sun, which by hypothesis is the same as it is in the real world. This is both very small and in the wrong direction, so there is no danger of “being sucked into space”, or indeed of experiencing any other weird gravitational effect.But what is A, in fact? We haveA = ω²Rwhere ω is the Earth's angular velocity. The Earth takes 1 year = 3 x 10⁷ seconds to go around the Sun, and R = 1.5 x 10¹¹ m, soA = 1.5 x 10¹¹ x (3 x 10⁷)⁻² m/s² = 1.7 x 10⁻⁴ m/s²However, the gravitational acceleration due to the Earth is 9.8 m/s², so we have the absurd result that the Sun's gravitational pull is actually much weaker than the Earth's. Thus the assumption that the Earth is going round the Sun must be incorrect, and the Sun is actually a very small body going round the Earth. So suppose instead that the Sun goes round the Earth. How far away is it? The angular velocity will be the same, so we haveg = ω²RR = g/ω²= 9.8 / (3 x 10⁷)⁻² = 9.8 x 9 x 10¹⁴ =~ 9 x 10¹⁵ m = 9 x 10¹² kmi.e. more than 60,000 times further away, and thus more than 60,000 times larger - but still, somehow, much less massive than the Earth. While we're at it, let's also think about the Moon. Its period is about 1/13 that of the Sun, so its distance will be 1/13² that of the Sun, i.e. 9/13² x 10¹² =~ 5 x 10¹⁰ km instead of 4 x 10⁵ km in real life. So the Moon is also much bigger than the Earth, but also much less massive.Bottom line: the “constant gravity” world just makes no sense, so it is very hard to talk meaningfully about what would happen there. But it is astonishing how much thought we required to come to this simple conclusion.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149060.Reach_for_Tomorrow

Clarke;1957;151 pages, Paperback;3.92;3194;;['Science Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Fantasy', 'Collections', 'Anthologies'];"From outside it was simply an ordinary-looking London pub, a place you'd have to be guided to more than once before you memorized its location, somewhere between Fleet Street and the Embankment. But if, by chance, an insider led you to the White Hart on a Wednesday night, you would have found yourself in the midst of a select gathering or writers, editors, scientists and interested laymen—drinking, swapping odd bits of information, and, like as not, listening to Harry Purvis' memorable stories.  A scientist by profession, Harry Purvis has had or heard about some of the most astonishing experiences—like the story of the carnivorous orchid that was used in a murder plot, or the one about the military computer that was converted to pacifism. There's SILENCE PLEASE, involving a spurned lover and a device that was supposed to destroy sound; and BIG GAME HUNT, in which an ambitious researcher becomes so wrapped up in his latest projest—controlling animal behavior with electrical impulses— that he overlooks one tiny important detail. Such stories may challenge your powers of logic and strain your imagination. Yet even if you doubt their veracity, they're guaranteed to provide you with hours of SF reading. Baron Munchausen, step aside.Contains: Silence Please; Big Game Hunt; Patent Pending; Armaments Race; Critical Mass; The Ultimate Melody; The Pacifist; The Next Tenants; Moving Spirit; The Man Who Ploughed the Sea; The Reluctant Orchid; Cold War; What Goes Up; Sleeping Beauty & The Defenestration of Ermintrude";"""Se llega a ""El Ciervo Blanco"" de forma inesperada, a través de una de esas callejas anónimas que bajan desde la calle Fleet hasta Embankment. Sería inútil explicarles dónde se encuentra; muy pocas personas, aun proponiéndoselo, han conseguido llegar. Para las doce primeras visitas es imprescindible la ayuda de un guía; después todo consiste en cerrar los ojos y confiar en el propio instinto, y a lo mejor se tiene suerte""Creo que casi todos tenemos nuestros lugares predilectos, nuestros lugares especiales desde que somos críos, jovenes o mayores, son nuestros lugares de reunión, nuestros lugares en los que somos o fuimos habituales. Lugares en los que cuando ponemos un pie en ellos, vemos caras conocidas cuya amistad con nosotros puede reiniciarse en segundos, aunque haya pasado tiempo. Este divertido libro de Arthur C. Clarke recoge quince improbables historias, narradas en un pub londinense en el que se reúne cada semana un selecto grupo de escritores, de científicos, periodistas y editores. La gran estrella de esta tertulia es Harry Purvis, es un jactancioso y ocurrente fabulador que aprovecha cualquier ocasión para abrumar a sus amigos con extraños sucesos de los que ha sido supuesto testigo o privilegiado conocedor.Tendremos inventos sorprendentes, situaciones impensadas y experimentos audaces (máquinas para producir silencio, reproducir el placer sexual o fabricar melodías perfectas, buques que aran los océanos, computadoras para uso militar que adoptan comportamientos pacifistas, colonias de termitas que incorporan conocimiento humano) constituyen la trama, ingeniosa e imaginativa de ""Cuentos de la Taberna del Ciervo Blanco"".Al frente del grupo, en un sentido ni elegido ni designado, está Harry Purvis, se trata del único personaje que aparece en todas las historias. Es el tipo de persona que puede iluminar cada conversación y caer bien. Es un aventurero que habla rápido, habla con franqueza y bromea que siempre tiene la historia más extraña en mente y, sin embargo, es muy relevante para lo que sea que se esté discutiendo. El prólogo nos dice que Clarke comenzó esta colección por alguna afrenta a la idea de que la ciencia ficción y la comedia no se mezclaban. Logra demostrar que combina bastante bien a través de la narración de historias que los científicos han intercambiado entre ellos en este maravilloso pub. Fue ingenioso porque le permite pasar de un tema a otro, burlándose de todo, desde Oxford hasta los estadounidenses, y mostrando el tipo de esnobismo bondadoso que puede ir casi de la mano con altos cocientes de inteligencia. La mezcla de suposiciones bromistas e improvisadas deja al lector perpetuamente entretenido. Y con más de una sonrisa.Según nos aclara el propio Clarke en el prólogo, el pub “El ciervo blanco” existió en realidad, aunque se llamaba “El caballo blanco”, una taberna situada en Londres. Después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial ese lugar sirvió como sede para una parte importante de los autores y aficionados de la ciencia ficción de Londres.En esta colección se abordan muchas cosas: la inteligencia artificial, también las operaciones microrobóticas, la presunción del hombre y la preocupación por el futuro. La mayoría de las historias son acumulaciones de una sola línea, y la mayoría son absolutamente divertidas, pero entremezcladas hay algunas historias que reducen todo a un nivel más serio antes de volver a subirlo. Incluso habrá una planta carnívora que os hará sonreír.A partir de ideas o teorías serias y rigurosas la la historia siempre termina en algo realmente disparatado y que sin embargo conserva un aire de realidad. La narrativa de Clarke es notable, como sus ideas. Todo es muy ágil, sencillo y todo es comprensible para el lector, un gran trabajo creando personajes muy definidos. Una CF que toca lo hilarante, ideas geniales en las que ves como el autor da rienda suelta a su ingenio. En las que a través de las sonrisas que nos provoca también tiene momentos de reflexión. Pues un invento o hallazgo de la ciencia es algo de enorme importancia que pueden tener una variedad de aplicaciones, y todo depende de las intenciones del que los usen, entra ahí el factor humano y las consecuencias catastróficas de sus decisiones.Tenemos relatos que van desde un profesor que inventa un dispositivo que registra las ondas cerebrales correspondientes a las sensaciones humanas, su asistente visualiza un uso mucho más rentable y sexual para el dispositivo...Un experto en efectos especiales mientras está trabajando en una actual serie de CF de bajo presupuesto para Hollywood, tiene la tarea de construir pistolas de rayos para ella, cada vez más impresionante. Hasta que crea una que funciona de verdad, resultados devastadores.Un empleado manso y tímido con afinidad por las orquídeas es intimidado rutinariamente por su tía Henrietta. Después de plantar una rara especie de orquídea carnívora en su invernadero, pronto idea un complot para deshacerse de ella. Este me encantó.En los desiertos de Australia un equipo de científicos se confunde mientras prueba un nuevo diseño de reactor nuclear. En lugar de una explosión, el reactor forma una burbuja antigravedad de varios cientos de pies de diámetro. Sin embargo, entrar en la burbuja podría resultar tan peligroso como caerse de una montaña.Y así muchos más, si bien me gustaron unos más que otros como pasa siempre en estos formatos, acabó ganando con un mayoría. Mi primer libro de Arthur C.Clarke y ha sido todo un éxito. Agradezco a mi estimado colega lector, Xabi1990, por su recomendación pues yo hubiera empezado con otros más famosos pero este creo que ha sido perfecto. Ya por el título y la sinopsis, se trataba de un libro que pega mucho conmigo. Para lectores y no lectores de la CF, es una lectura muy recomendable de una mente adelantada a su tiempo.Leedlo, disfrutad y sonreíd.. ✍️";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149055.Tales_from_the_White_Hart
The Other Side Of The Sky;Arthur C. Clarke;1958;245 pages, Paperback;4.01;2405;;['Science Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Collections', 'Anthologies', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Short Story Collection'];The Other Side of the Sky presents a glimpse of our future: a future where reality is no longer contained in earthly dimensions, where man has learned to exist with the knowledge that he is not alone in the universe. These stories of other planets and galactic adventures show Arthur C Clarke at the peak of his powers: sometimes disturbing, always intriguing.;"A wonderful collection of sci-fi shorts!THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SKY is a collection of short stories by Arthur C Clarke, an author whom many consider as an icon of both classic and contemporary science fiction. Frankly, I never agreed. I always felt that his work was pretentious - ""literary"" in the most pejorative sense of the word, mystifying, muddy and purposely deep, yet without clarity, for the sole purpose of achieving the lofty height of being arty.No doubt others may disagree with me, but when I read the opening story in this collection, THE NINE BILLION NAMES OF GOD, my first reaction was disappointment - ""oh, oh, more of the same""! Why would anyone, even those with an abiding faith in their god, believe that there was some sort of deep religious or philosophical ramification to the act of physically preparing a complete list of the permutations of an arbitrarily selected set of letters? What meaningless drivel!I almost closed the book at that point and I suspect it was because the next story was only a few pages long that I decided to try it anyway. And what a lucky choice for me! From that point on, the collection was a thoroughgoing winner with everything a reader could wish for - charm, characterization, fun, pathos, warmth, wit, depth, twists, humour, human interest, solid science and thought-provoking questions - all of this without ever stooping to being either mundane or, worse yet, snobbish and superior.A few examples will perhaps to serve to whet the appetite. REFUGEE manages to humanize the British royal family in a most appealing way. SPECIAL DELIVERY explains some of the difficulties of living in a satellite and the physical implications of a jammed autopilot that accelerates a rocket delivering supplies for just a few seconds too long - a very, very small incident that illustrates the enormous implications of such a tiny event. COSMIC CASANOVA is pure space humour with an unexpected ending reserved for the final sentence in the manner of Jeffrey Archer's A TWIST IN THE TALE. PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN is tongue in cheek and humorous but it is also a clear and scathing condemnation of bigotry and man's xenophobia. THE STAR could not be perceived as anti-religious in its tone but this tale of a very special and unique supernova should provoke more than a little head-scratching and puzzlement in those that would interpret the Bible literally. (This was probably my favourite story in the entire collection)If you're already an Arthur C Clarke fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SKY. If like me, you were unconvinced of his right to icon status, try this one on for size. Plenty enjoyable enough that I'd be happy to pick up more of Clarke's work and give it a try again. Maybe I'll even go back and try some of his other stuff again to see if perhaps I missed something. It's happened before!Recommended.Paul Weiss";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/358859.The_Other_Side_Of_The_Sky
Tales of Ten Worlds;Arthur C. Clarke;1962;245 pages, Paperback;4.0;2104;;['Science Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Collections', 'Anthologies', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Audiobook'];This outstanding short story collection fuses science fact and fiction in an impressive showcase that will enthrall both enthusiast and newcomer alike..This classic collection of short stories includes some of Clarke's finest vivid glimpses into the future, a year, a decade, a century, a millennium from now.;"This classic collection of short stories includes some of Clarke's finest work: vivid glimpses into the future, a year, a decade, a century, a millennium from now.I first read this book in the 1960s and its images have stayed with me whenever I think of Arthur C. Clarke. To review a collection of short stories is a balancing act. Do I tediously describe each story making it easy for the reader to say ""I've read all of the review so I don't need to read the book"" A bit like those movie trailers that show all the action scenes.Or do I gloss over all the stories simply saying that they show a coming of age in the growing field of science fiction - which gives the reader no idea of what they are about and no reason to read any.I am trying for the middle way so bear with me as I give you Tales of Ten Worlds.""I remember Babylon""Clarke wrote this back in 1945, before satellite relays, cell phones and the internet. It shows how uncensored pornography would become the downfall of the western nations. (Has it already happened?)""Summertime on Icarus""A brave man facing death by being too close to the Sun. A great thriller from the early days of space flight.""Death and the Senator""Clarke's answer to a real politician, William Proxmire, who did not want to fund the space program. On my first reading I did not understand the significance. Years later I stumbled upon the dreadful things Proxmire was doing in order to support his dairy farm voters.The stories are;I REMEMBER BABYLON SUMMERTIME ON ICARUSOUT OF THE CRADLE, ENDLESSLY ORBITINGWHO'S THERE?HATE INTO THE COMET AN APE ABOUT THE HOUSESATURN RISING LET THERE BE LIGHT DEATH AND THE SENATOR TROUBLE WITH TIMEBEFORE EDEN A SLIGHT CASE OF SUNSTROKE DOG STAR THE ROAD TO THE SEAAlways leave the customer wanting more.

The first year or so of this project I did not add new read dates to some titles and I did not update the original reviews. I still won't be doing that, but I wanted to have the dates properly recorded. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the preface to this book, Clarke states that all of the short stories he wrote in the 60's (and three from the early 70's) are included. There are 18 stories here, most of them quite short but all packing a punch as relevant today as back in the Space Age when they were written.We spend time in deep space, in the deeps of Earth's oceans, and deep within Clarke's amazingly creative imagination. He asks What If? about many topics, and builds answers that make you think. What If a newly installed satellite telephone network took over the world? Dial F for Frankenstein, June 1963 What If the biggest giant squid we know about is just a scout for a true giant? The Shining Ones, December 1962What If there was only one way to avoid destruction by a rogue Black Dwarf? Love That Universe, October 1966What If an ancient Intelligence from the far reaches of space has come to the conclusion that something must be done about the illogical signs of supposed intelligence coming from the third planet from the sun? Crusade, October 1966What If Man could visit Jupiter? A Meeting With Medusa, February 1971These were the ones I liked best, but my favorite story of the collection was when Clarke asks What If a race of Beings whose ancestors had colonized Earth arrived with the cure for the disfiguring disease that ruined lives and changed history millions of years ago? Reunion, November 1963.I've read this book many times, but I never get tired of it. Thank you, Mr. Clarke!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149056.The_Wind_From_the_Sun
