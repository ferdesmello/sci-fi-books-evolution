Robinson.;"3rd Review
- August 2022I read Frankenstein for a sixth time this week. Although it is one of my favourite novels, and in my opinion one of the finest pieces of fiction ever written, I find myself with a new appreciation of the text every time I come to it. A large proportion of one of my PhD chapters is about this novel. I'm discussing the idea of the vegetable diet along with purity and becoming our natural selves. And I'm also considering notions of animal rights, of the idea that man is very much an animal too and he has lost this sense of original self. Frankenstein at its very core is a novel about duality, of our capability to be both good and evil and to be both human and animal. There is so much to take from this book and there's so much that be taken apart, scrutinised and then put back together again. What's truly striking about the work is how much is reflects the anxieties of the age. It's full of insecurities about nature, god, science and our place in the world. Ultimately, it is a novel that creates a sense of unease because it highlights so much about the inauthentic nature of the lives many of us live. Running through the novel is a craving for freedom: a craving to to simply exist in a natural way. 
2nd Review
- January 2020Some books teach you something new each time you revisit them. I picked up the tragically wonderful Frankenstein for a fifth time this week, and I was totally mesmerised by the descriptive language used to describe the natural world. In all my previous readings, I focused on all the classic tropes of man and monster though I never considered the importance of the serene beauty that surrounds the story. The natural world dominates the background of the novel. It’s there, like a pervading monster that lingers in the darkest reaches of the mind. What struck me most about it was the fact that both Victor and his creation long for a real life, a life where one is truly alive. And they both ponder what this means at length, reaching the same conclusion: to go completely nomad. They both wish to live a life free of burden and complications, no money, no commitments and no responsibility. They just want to be totally free in the wilderness with the ultimate goal of finding happiness by looking after their most immediate and natural desires. And for me this says a great deal about society, not just the society in which this was written, but society in general: how many of us feel truly alive? 
Original Review
- 2016Let’s have a party Victor. Let’s get together and celebrate all things Gothic, and dark, and wonderful. Let’s have it in an attic in an old house in the middle of a thunderstorm, and then afterwards let’s go to the graveyard with our shovels and our body bags. Sounds good doesn’t it Victor? We could then create our own doppelgängers from the corpses of criminals and geniuses. Then we can abandon our marvellous creation to fend for itself with his childlike innocence, and then wonder why it goes so horribly wrong and blows up in our faces. Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. On second thought we probably shouldn’t have that party. Because if we did it would end in blood Yes, lots of blood: the blood of everyone you love, the blood of all your family Victor. You blame the monster, but you are his creator. You should have taught him the ways of the world and guided his first steps. The things you two could have accomplished together. So I ask you this Victor, who is the real monster? Is it the creature that has gone on a murderous rampage or it you? You are the man who played at god and was horrified at the consequence. You judged your creation by his physical appearance, which was more a reflection of your vain soul. Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. Surely you don’t wonder why the monster revenged himself upon you?“I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel...”Indeed, the real monster of this novel is Victor Frankenstein, and not his monstrous creation. The creature is a monster on the outside but Victor is on the inside, which is a form much worse. By abandoning the creature he has taught him to become what his appearance is. The first human experience he receives is rejection based upon his physicality. His own creator recoils in disgust from him. He cannot be blamed for his actions if all he has been taught is negative emotion, he will only respond in one way. He is innocent and childlike but also a savage brute. These are two things that should never be put together. Woe to Victor Frankenstein’s family. “There is love in me the likes of which you've never seen. There is rage in me the likes of which should never escape. If I am not satisfied in the one, I will indulge the other.”Mary Shelley raises questions of the danger of knowledge, and shows a probable consequence of trying to play god; the novel portrays nineteen century fears for the rising field of science and knowledge and questions how far it could go. Indeed, in this case Victor takes on the role of a God by creating new life. She also shows us what can happen to a man if he so driven by this thirst for knowledge and how it will ultimately lead to a fall. Victor reminds me somewhat of Doctor Faustus (The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus) in this regard. Faustus is a man who sold his soul to Lucifer for unlimited knowledge in the form of arcane magic. Victor, like Faustus, has stopped at nothing to gain his goal, but in the end is ultimately dissatisfied with the result. Suffice to say, I simply adore this book as you may have gathered from my ramblings. I think this, alongside Dracula, are amongst the strongest representations of Gothic literature. Furthermore, I have a real soft spot for epistolary means of storytelling. I’m not sure why, perhaps it’s the stronger sense of intimacy you fell with the characters as you see their words on the page rather than an impartial narrators. You see inside their heads more and understand their motifs and feelings. My favourite quote:""This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. Listen to the passion, to the intellect and witness such a wasted opportunity. Victor, you’re a silly, silly, man.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35031085-frankenstein
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea;Jules Verne;1869;1860;269;3.89;258932;yes;['Classics', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'France', 'Literature'];When an unidentified “monster” threatens international shipping, French oceanographer Pierre Aronnax and his unflappable assistant Conseil join an expedition organized by the US Navy to hunt down and destroy the menace. After months of fruitless searching, they finally grapple with their quarry, but Aronnax, Conseil, and the brash Canadian harpooner Ned Land are thrown overboard in the attack, only to find that the “monster” is actually a futuristic submarine, the Nautilus, commanded by a shadowy, mystical, preternaturally imposing man who calls himself Captain Nemo. Thus begins a journey of 20,000 leagues—nearly 50,000 miles—that will take Captain Nemo, his crew, and these three adventurers on a journey of discovery through undersea forests, coral graveyards, miles-deep trenches, and even the sunken ruins of Atlantis. Jules Verne’s novel of undersea exploration has been captivating readers ever since its first publication in 1870, and Frederick Paul Walter’s reader-friendly, scientifically meticulous translation of this visionary science fiction classic is complete and unabridged down to the smallest substantive detail.;"Hands down the WORST book I've read all year.I mean, there's boring and then there's mind-numbing. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is definitely the latter. I was actually looking forward to listening to this. It's supposed to be a classic action/adventure sci-fi book, right? And it's not an overly long book, which made me assume it was a pretty compact story. Plus, I usually have better luck when it comes to these older novels if I listen to the audiobook instead of trying to wade through all the crunchy dialogue with my eyeballs. So, between those factors, I thought this would be a complete winner.But ho-ly shit this was terrible. Terrible!  Ok, how to describe this book?Alright. If a really tedious nature show fucked a 5th grade word problem and didn't use a condom - 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea would be their bastard child.The vast majority of this thing:Lattitude 54, Longitude 45. <--or whatever.On the {insert random date here} the crew of the Nautilus and my companions entered the {insert random body of water here} and observed {insert random sea life here}. Then Aronnax would go on to describe in excruciating detail every fucking thing about whatever chunk of seaweed, fish, oyster bed, sediment, etc. that they happened to be floating past.Now, sometimes my mind will wander for a second when I'm listening to an audiobook. Usually, it's one of those Did I remember to give my kid the check for that field trip? things that distract me. And then I'll just have to back the book up a few seconds to recoup whatever info I just lost. But with this one, I was spacing out constantly due to the fact that there was literally NOTHING happening. But I could lose half an hour and it wouldn't fucking matter because the professor would still be droning on about different types of pearls and how they were made, and what colors there were, and how much each kind sold for on the open market, and whether or not the oyster wept when they were gone.Or some other such nonsense.Where was the action I was promised?! Where was the adventure?!Not here, that's for goddamn sure.Still, I remembered hearing about the famous Scene With The Giant Squid and I figured it might make all of this other garbage worth wading through. Supposedly, it was this super awesome battle between man and cephalopod that left a lasting impression on people. <--I should have known better. Lamest. Battle. Ever.Let me save you some trouble. See, I thought that there was some menacing squid following them that decided to attack the sub and try to drag it to the bottom, or crush it with its massive tentacles, or break it open to slurp out the crew with a straw, or...something. Anything!But no.A group of big-ass squids was swimming by, a few got curious, one of the poor bastards got tangled around the fan or whatnot, and then when the crew when out to ""fight"" it off the Nautilus one of them got tossed off and killed. Oh, and Ned almost got eaten but Nemo hacked at the squid's beak and saved him. The End.Bah.There was a shining moment when I thought things were going to finally get cool as the Nautilus passed over Atlantis. Fucking Atlantis! <--Yes!These turds got out to explore every dull coral bed along the way, so surely they would stop and meander around this magically advanced civilization, right?Nope.They just floated on past it.Bye, Aquaman...And after that, I think I just lost the will to even try to muster up a few shits for the rest of it.Nemo's quitting land because of {insert spoilery things here} was also ridiculous but I could have easily given it a pass if this were a remotely engaging story otherwise. Since it wasn't, that was just ONE MORE THING that I found annoying. I mean, really? Why the hell would anyone go to all that trouble of building this masterpiece of a submarine just for revenge? Just track the fuckers down and shoot them in the head. It would be waaaaay easier and ultimately less time-consuming. Oh, and their stupid secret language that they spoke on board? It was probably Pig Latin, because everything else they did seemed like something thought up by a 10 year old.Why keep Aronnax, Conseil, & Ned prisoner just because they had seen the Nautilus? <--made no sense!It's not as though anyone could track them down even if those guys spilled the beans!They were literally the ONLY submarine in the world at that point and the oceans are HUGE. Again, I would have overlooked that with pleasure if I weren't so pissed off with this boring time-suck. The only fun thing about this was Ned Land. <--harpooner extraordinaire Just the fact that he is the ONLY surly Canadian I've ever read about was almost worth the price of admission. Seriously. Name another volatile Canuck in literature.Kind of hard to do, eh?


Or is it, Bub?



Anyway. It may be hard to tell but I didn't actually like this very much. However, if you did? Well, then that's good, too.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33507.Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea
Journey to the Center of the Earth;Jules Verne;1864;1860;240;3.85;205807;no;['Classics', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'France', 'Audiobook'];An adventurous geology professor chances upon a manuscript in which a 16th-century explorer claims to have found a route to the earth's core. Professor Lidenbrock can't resist the opportunity to investigate, and with his nephew Axel, he sets off across Iceland in the company of Hans Bjelke, a native guide. The expedition descends into an extinct volcano toward a sunless sea, where they encounter a subterranean world of luminous rocks, antediluvian forests, and fantastic marine life — a living past that holds the secrets to the origins of human existence.;"One does not simply walk into the center of the Earth.  Young student Axel and Professor Otto Lidenbrock, studying a very old manuscript, discover an ancient pathway into the center of the Earth. They immediately travel to Iceland, and with the assistance of Hans, a local guide, they find an entrance in Snæfellsjökull, a volcano near Reykjavík. The travel is extensively long, and not without its many perils. Will they be able to make it? And what amazing wonders await hidden within the depths of the Earth?An incredible adventure like only the immortal Jules Verne can deliver. The book starts somewhat slow, and I must confess I found everything regarding Iceland particularly boring, but once they enter the volcano, it’s a non-stop journey of thrilling dangers and ever greater surprises. I’ll never forget the caverns, the underground sea voyage and all the amazing lifeforms found in the prehistoric land.  Never ending sheer amazement. This is my favorite Verne book so far, I’ve read a few others and I'm always intent on reading more. His extraordinary voyage series is pure classic magic.It’s public domain. You can find it  HERE.*** The movie (2008) is an entertaining adaptation. Not a great movie, nor exactly faithful to the book, some very big licenses were taken, but still very popcorn worthy. Stellar cast including stars like Fraser, Hutcherson and Briem. I think the best of the movie are the especial effects, beyond awesome, and, if not the plot, at least they truly depict the beautiful essence of all the wonders of this hidden world Verne created with his book. All the anti-gravity stuff felt absolutely preposterous, but oh well, Hollywood right? But other than that, very entertaining, and easy to watch. Overall a nice complement to the reading.*** The movie (1959) is a somewhat mediocre adaptation. Several changes were made to the plot, and none particularly good. These include a second shadow expedition with a merciless antagonist, a new partner with a romance, and a brief period in Atlantis. The only thing I liked was the introduction of Gertrude, a companion goose; which coincidentally was also the saddest thing. The plot was very slow paced and mostly boring. There were also several scenes of singing, which annoyed me to no end. The effects were lacking, but considering the year of filming might be excusable. Prof. Lindenbrook is portrayed as an obnoxious misogynist jerk. And the acting (of everyone) was subpar at best.-----------------------------------------------

El viaje es extensivamente largo, y no sin sus muchos peligros. ¿Podrán acaso lograrlo? ¿Y qué asombrosas maravillas esperan escondidas en las profundidades de la Tierra?Una increíble Aventura como solo el inmortal Julio Verne puede entregar. El libro empieza algo lento, y debo admitir que encontré todo lo que respecta a Islandia bastante aburrido, pero una vez que entran en el volcán, es un sinfín de emocionantes peligros y cada vez mayores sorpresas. Nunca voy a olvidar las cavernas, el viaje marino bajo la tierra, y todas las asombrosas formas de vida encontradas en esa tierra prehistórica.  Puro asombro sin final. Este es mi libro favorito de Verne hasta ahora, leí algunos más y siempre tengo la intención de leer otros. Su serie de viajes extraordinarios son pura magia clásica.Es dominio público, lo pueden encontrar  ACA.*** La película (2008) es una entretenida adaptación. No una gran película, ni exactamente fiel a la obra, algunas licencias muy grandes fueron tomadas, pero aun así muy digna de palomitas de maíz. Un elenco estelar incluyendo estrellas como Fraser, Hutcherson y Briem. Creo que lo mejor de la película fueron los efectos especiales, más allá de espectaculares, y, sino la trama, al menos verdaderamente representan la hermosa esencia de todas las maravillas de este mundo secreto que Verne creó en su libro. La parte de la anti gravedad me pareció totalmente absurdo, pero bueno, ¿eso es Hollywood no? Pero más allá de eso, muy entretenida, y fácil de ver. Dentro de todo un lindo complemento para la lectura.*** La película (1959) es una bastante mediocre adaptación. Varios cambios fueron hechos a la trama, y ninguno particularmente bueno. Estos incluyen una segunda expedición fantasma con un despiadado antagonista, una compañera nueva con romance, y un breve período en Atlantis. Lo único que me gustó fue la introducción de Gertrude, un compañero ganso; que coincidentemente también fue lo más triste. La trama fue muy lenta y mayormente aburrida. También hubo varias escenas de canto, que me fastidian al máximo. Los efectos fueron decepcionantes, pero considerando el año de filmación podría ser excusable. El Prof. Lindenbrook es retratado como un insoportable idiota misógino. Y la actuación (de todos) fue menos que regular cuando mucho.-----------------------------------------------

From the Earth to the Moon;Jules Verne;1865;1860;136;3.76;36350;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'France', 'Fantasy', 'Literature'];Een in de 19e eeuw geschreven verhaal over een reis naar de maan, waaruit blijkt dat de schrijver in technisch opzicht zijn tijd ver vooruit was;De la Terre à la Lune = From the Earth to the Moon (Extraordinary Voyages #4), Jules Verne From the Earth to the Moon is an 1865 novel by Jules Verne. It tells the story of the Baltimore Gun Club, a post-American Civil War society of weapons enthusiasts, and their attempts to build an enormous Columbiad space gun and launch three people—the Gun Club's president, his Philadelphian armor-making rival, and a French poet—in a projectile with the goal of a Moon landing. The story is also notable in that Verne attempted to do some rough calculations as to the requirements for the cannon and in that, considering the comparative lack of empirical data on the subject at the time, some of his figures are remarkably accurate. However, his scenario turned out to be impractical for safe manned space travel since a much longer barrel would have been required to reach escape velocity while limiting acceleration to survivable limits for the passengers. The character of Michel Ardan, the French member of the party in the novel, was inspired by the real-life photographer Félix Nadar.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «مسافرت به ماه»؛ «از زمین تا کره ماه»؛ «سفر به کره ماه»؛ «سفر به ماه»؛ «گردش به دور کره ماه»؛ «مسافرت از زمین به کره ماه»؛ «مسافرت به کره ماه»؛ «دور ماه»، نویسنده: ژول ورن؛ انتشاراتیها: (عطائی، بنگاه ترجمه و نشر کتاب، علمی فرهنگی؛ گلشائی؛ فروغی، توسن، عارف، کوشش، توسعه کتابخانه های ایران، سپیده، میلکان، و ...)؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: یکی از روزهای سال1970میلادیعنوان: از زمین تا کره ماه؛ نویسنده: ژول ورن؛ مترجم: حدادی؛ تهران، عطائی، سال1337؛ در136ص؛ موضوع: داستانهای علمی تخیلی از نویسندگان فرانسه - سده 19معنوان: مسافرت به ماه؛ نویسنده: ژول ورن؛ مترجم اردشیر نیکپور؛ تهران، بنگاه ترجمه و نشر کتاب، سال1340؛ در309ص؛ بارها چاپ شده؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، علمی فرهنگی، سال1387؛ در هفده و280ص، شابک9789644459023؛ چاپ چهارم علمی فرهنگی سال1393؛عنوان: مسافرت به کره ماه؛ نویسنده: ژول ورن؛ مترجم: محمدرضا امینی؛ تهران، گلشائی، سال1362؛ در111ص؛ عنوان: مسافرت از زمین به کره ماه؛ نویسنده: ژول ورن؛ مترجم: عنایت الله شکیباپور؛ تهران، فروغی، سال1369؛ در280ص؛ عنوان: سفر به کره ماه؛ نویسنده: ژول ورن؛ مترجم: سهیلا احمدی؛ تهران، توسن، سال1363؛ در112ص؛ عنوان: گردش به دور کره ماه؛ نویسنده: ژول ورن؛ مترجم: محسن آزادی؛ تهران، توسن، سال1363؛ در213ص؛ چاپها�� دیگر با شابک9646282156؛ عنوان: سفر به کره ماه؛ نویسنده: ژول ورن؛ مترجم: قدیر گلکاریان؛ تهران، عارف، سال1370؛ در128ص؛ عنوان: سفر به ماه؛ نویسنده: ژول ورن؛ مترجم: فاطمه نقاش؛ تهران، کوشش، سال1375؛ در112ص؛ عنوان: سفر به ماه؛ نویسنده: ژول ورن؛ مترجم: حسین چترنور؛ تهران، توسعه کتابخانه های ایران، سال1376؛ در123ص؛ چاپ سوم سال1380؛ چهارم سال1381؛ ششم سال1384؛ شابک9648209181؛عنوان: سفر به ماه، مترجم: خسرو شایسته؛ تهران، سپیده، چاپ ششم سال1370، در157ص؛عنوان: سفر به ماه؛ نویسنده: ژول ورن؛ مترجم: محبوبه موسوی؛ تهران، میلکان، سال1393؛ در210ص؛ شابک9786007443941؛این کتاب با عنوان «دور ماه» نیز چاپ شده استفهرست کتاب: «باشگاه اسلحه»؛ «طرح پرزیدنت باربیکن»؛ «کاپیتان نیکول و اشکالات»؛ «پوکه»، «توپ را کجا باید کار گذاشت»؛ «ساختن توپ غول پیکر»؛ «توپ خنک میشود»؛ «تلگرام»؛ «میشل آردن میآید»؛ «من هم میروم»؛ «ساختمان پوکه»، «درون پوکه»؛ «پوکه را درون توپ میگذارند»؛ «توپ شلیک میشود»؛ «گمشده»، «داخل پوکه چه میگذرد»؛ «بعد از شلیک توپ»؛ «دوم دسامبر»، «سوم دسامبر»؛ «گور فضایی»؛ «نیمه شب پنجم دسامبر»؛ «شمال ماه»، «جنوب ماه»؛ «خسوف»، «سقوط بزرگ»؛ «آنها برمیگردند»؛ «آنها برگشته اند»؛ «عملیات نجات»؛ «جلسه اعضای باشگاه اسلحه»؛چکیده داستان: زمان: سال1865میلادی؛ مکان: «آمریکا»، ایالت «مریلند»، شهر «بالتیمور»؛باشگاه «گان (باشگاه توپچیهای بالتیمور)»، باشگاهی بود، که در زمان جنگ، برای کشورِ «آمریکا»، توپ و گلوله تهیه میکرد؛ در پایان جنگ انفصال (جدایی)، در «آمریکا»، کار باشگاه نیز، به اتمام رسیده بود، و هر کدام از مسئولان آن، در پی کاری دیگر بودند؛ «ایمی باربیکن»، رئیس باشگاه «گان»، پیشنهادی داد که همه از شنیدن آن، هیجان زده شدند؛ اعضای باشگاه، طبق پیشنهاد او تصمیم می­گیرند، که به وسیله یک گلوله ی بزرگ آلومینیومی، که از یک توپ عظیم به طول نهصد پا، پرتاب میشود، با کره ی ماه ارتباط برقرار کنند!؛قرار میشود گلوله، در تاریخ روز نخست ماه «دسامبر»، سیزده دقیقه مانده به ساعت یازده، پرتاب شود، و طبق محاسبات، چهار روز پس از پرتاب به ماه خواهد رسید؛ «میشل آردن فرانسوی (مردی خودساخته ولی نه مجرب، که همه چیز را بزرگ میبیند، مگر آدمیان و دشواریها را)» درخواست میکند، که در درون این گلوله، به ماه برود؛ «باربیکن»، رئیس «گان کلاب»، و دشمن خونی «میشل آردن»، که اکنون با او آشتی کرده است، و سروان «نیکول»، که یقین دارد، که اینکار به ثمر نخواهد رسید، با او همسفر میشوند؛ گلوله، که کاملترین ابزارهای علمی را، در خود دارد، و مجهز شده است، در یک شب مهتابی، در حضور هزاران نفر، سفر خود را آغاز میکند؛ «بلفوست»، مدیر رصدخانه «کمبریج»، و «ماستون»، دبیر «گان کلاب»، این سفر فضایی را، با تلسکوپ عظیمی، در «لانگز پیک»، روی کوههای صخره ­ای، دنبال میکنند …؛ سفر به ماه، رمانی پر از رویداد اثر «ژول ورن»، داستان نویس نامدار «فرانسوی» است، که نخستین بار در سال1865میلادی منتشر شد؛ «ژول ورن»، تعدادی از موفقترین شخصیتهایش، یعنی «باربیکنِ» مبادی آداب، «نیکولِ» تندخو، و «آردنِ» سرخوش را، در این کتاب گرد هم آورده اند؛ این کتاب، بیش از دیگر آثار «ژول ورن»، از طنزی برخوردار است، که به این ماجرای دیوانه ­وار، رنگی از راستی میزند؛ از آن زمان که انسان ماه را، به عنوان کره‌ ای دیگر شناخت، آرزوی پرواز خود را، با آرزوی دستیابی به تنها قمر زمین، عجین ساخت؛ اما سال‌های بسیاری نیاز بود بگذرد؛ حتی از زمانی که «ژول ورن» در داستان خود، انسان را به ماه رساند نیز، مدت‌ها گذشت، تا بالاخره این رویای انسانی «ژول ورن» لباس راستین پوشیدتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 01/11/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 28/08/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32827.From_the_Earth_to_the_Moon
Around the World in Eighty Days;Jules Verne;1872;1870;252;3.94;255883;no;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Science Fiction', 'France', 'Travel', 'Fantasy'];One night in the reform club, Phileas Fogg bets his companions that he can travel across the globe in just eighty days. Breaking the well-established routine of his daily life, he immediately sets off for Dover with his astonished valet Passepartout. Passing through exotic lands and dangerous locations, they seize whatever transportation is at hand—whether train or elephant—overcoming set-backs and always racing against the clock.;"""Truly, would you not for less than that make a tour around the world?""This is the second Verne book I have devoured in two days which have both been accredited four-five stars. I could end the review at that and I would be content!Similar to The Journey to the Centre of the Earth which I read yesterday - Verne creates amazingly awesome and complex characters. The main protagonist Mr. Fogg is an obsessive-compulsive routine loving timekeeper who bets his chums at the club that he can travel around the world in 80 days, which a newspaper said was possible - if no delays were incurred. He is so deep, that so much is beneath the surface of this quiet, content gentleman. Never fearing or worrying whatever dilemmas are thrown in his path and always willing to fail the mission to help his friends. He is also very good at handling a boat. I have to ask - does anyone know if he has been in any of Verne's previous stories as it seems like he has an amazing past. If he hasn't been present and that is just what is built up by the writing in this book I am speechless. His trusty French manservant is amazing too - Not for a long time have two characters been so three dimensional and have I truly cared about them so much in 200 or so pages. This dude is clever, he worries like he is always ruining the plan but he is very loyal, apt gymnast and sometimes a lifesaver.Other characters Fix (a stalking policeman) and Aouda (a rescued Indian damsel) are amazingly created colourful characters too.I don't want to say too much of the story but it takes places all over the world. London, China, India, Japan, HK, America, Liverpool amongst others. Full of amazing set pieces that whilst being gripping always bring a smile to your face. Traveling on an elephant to rescue a lady due to be burnt to the death, fighting bandits on railway lines in the US are just a couple of these many amazing incidents. I was expecting a scene with a hot air balloon which I see in all the film version advertisements which (spoiler) is not in the book.I do think that later I am going to watch the Steve Coogan /Jackie Chan version of this to see how it compares. Once again my Goodreads friends, this was free on Kindle/Amazon. Check it out.Love as always.

The Mysterious Island;Jules Verne;1874;1870;723;4.13;55286;yes;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'France', 'Literature'];After hijacking a balloon from a Confederate camp, a band of five northern prisoners escapes the American Civil War. Seven thousand miles later, they drop from the clouds onto an uncharted volcanic island in the Pacific. Through teamwork, scientific knowledge, engineering, and perseverance, they endeavour to build a colony from scratch. But this island of abundant resources has its secrets. The castaways discover they are not alone. A shadowy, yet familiar, agent of their unfathomable fate is watching.What unfolds in Jules Verne’s imaginative marvel is both an enthralling mystery and the ultimate in survivalist adventures.;"""Before all masters, necessity is the one most listened to, and who teaches the best.""This book is one of the most complete books I have ever read - literally. One one hand, it contains what we normally look for in a book like this, elements related to a great adventure. Then on the other hand it has so much more what we would never expect: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Geography, Geology, Astrology, Navigation, Cultivation, Food Production, Metallurgy, Biology, Medicine and so many more, not in mere statements, but in very descriptive explanations. I did not at all expected this book to contain so much information. Personally, I found those fascinating, as I love all things Engineering. I also imagined the regular reader might not like this as much. But it's quite a wonder how well this book has been received by many readers, and has not been criticized for being over-descriptive (or boring).""Civilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it onwards.""Sure, it's a long book, but that does not take away a bit from the sense of adventure and mystery it offers. If you're a big fan of adventure books, living the life of those characters over their long, eventful, and ever thrilling journey is one of the best reading experiences one can have. Well, if I do ever get marooned on an island, I don't think I'll be out of ideas now :)""Sir, your error was in supposing that the past can be resuscitated, and in contending against inevitable progress.

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde;Robert Louis Stevenson;1886;1880;139;3.83;600432;no;['Horror', 'Gothic', 'Science Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Fantasy', 'Literature', 'Audiobook'];Robert Louis Stevenson's masterpiece of the duality of good and evil in man's nature sprang from the darkest recesses of his own unconscious—during a nightmare from which his wife awakened him, alerted by his screams. More than a hundred years later, this tale of the mild-mannered Dr. Jekyll and the drug that unleashes his evil, inner persona—the loathsome, twisted Mr. Hyde—has lost none of its ability to shock. Its realistic police-style narrative chillingly relates Jekyll's desperation as Hyde gains control of his soul—and gives voice to our own fears of the violence and evil within us. Written before Freud's naming of the ego and the id, Stevenson's enduring classic demonstrates a remarkable understanding of the personality's inner conflicts—and remains the irresistibly terrifying stuff of our worst nightmares.;"”It came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter, and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance rather of a leap of welcome. This too, was myself.”

Richard Mansfield was mostly known for his dual role depicted in this double exposure. The stage adaptation opened in London in 1887, a year after the publication of the novella. (Picture 1895).Dr. Henry Jekyll is a brilliant man who in the course of trying to understand the human psyche has turned himself, with tragic results, into a guinea pig for his experiments. He has unleashed a power from within that is turning out to be too formidable to be properly contained. This book was released in 1886 and at first none of the bookshop wanted to carry the book because of the subject matter, but a positive review had people flocking to the stores to read this sinister tale of hubris overcoming reason. 

The American first edition is the true first edition because it preceded the London edition by three daysThe timing was perfect for releasing such a tale. The Victorian society was struggling with the morality that had been imposed upon them by the previous generation. They were embracing vice. Many men of means living in London now found themselves hearing the siren song of pleasures available on the East End. They could be as naughty as they wanted and safely leave their depravity on that side of town before they return to the respectable bosom of their family and careers. They were struggling with the dual natures of their existences. The thunder of the church and the faces of their sweet families made them feel guilty for their need to drink gin in decrepit pubs, smoke opiates in dens of inequity, consort with underage whores, and run the very real risk of being robbed by cutthroats. This walk on the wild side also allowed them the privilege of feeling completely superior to all those beings providing their means of entertainment. Jekyll as it turns out is no different. He relishes the adventures of his other persona even as he feels the mounting horror of losing control of this other self he calls Mr. Edward Hyde. Furthermore, his creation has no loyalty. ”My two natures had memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll, or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit.”

Spencer Tracy plays Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in 1941.Unfortunately indifference becomes more personal, more brutal in nature, as Hyde becomes more and more a caged animal who does not want to have to embrace the pretenses of Jekyll’s respectable position. ”The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person; he loathed the necessity, he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll had fallen, and he resented the dislike which he was himself regarded.”The tincture that has so far allowed Jekyll to contain Hyde is needing to be doubled and tripled to give Jekyll some modicum of control over his deviant nature. Jekyll contacts every apothecary he knows trying to find more of the solution he needs only to discover that the original batch that he used to make his “grand discovery” with must have been tainted with a foreign substance unknown to any of the suppliers. This foreign substance, unfortunately, is the ingredient that made the emergence and the restraint of Hyde possible. Dire circumstances indeed. Men who normally did not read novels were buying this book. I believe they were looking for some insight into their own nature maybe even some sympathy for their own urges. They made a book that quite possibly could have been thought of as an entertaining gothic novel into an international best seller. New generations of readers are still finding this book essential reading. Even those that have never read this book know the plot and certainly know the names of Jekyll and Hyde. It has inspired numerous movies, mini-series, comic books, and plays. It could be argued that it is one of the most influential novels on the creative arts. It was but a dream. Robert Louis Stevenson was stymied for a new idea. He was racking his brain hoping for inspiration. ”He had his names for the agents of his dreams, his whimsical alter ego and writing self. Stevenson referred to these agents, it pains me to admit, as ‘the little people’ and the ‘the Brownies.’ His hope was that they would supply him with marketable tales.”

RLSIt came to him in a nightmare that had him screaming loudly enough to wake the whole household. It was a gift from the depths of his mind, maybe an acknowledgement of his own dark thoughts, his own darkest desires.He wrote the nightmare down on paper feverishly over ten days. When he read the final draft to his wife, Fanny, her reaction was not what he expected. She was cold to the tale, completely against publishing such a sensationalized piece of writing. They argued, thin skinned to any criticism as most writers are especially when it is a complete repudiation of a piece of writing he was particularly proud of; Stevenson, in a moment of rage, tossed the whole manuscript in the fireplace. Be still my heart. There is no arguing with success of this magnitude, but I can’t help but wonder what was in that first draft. If there is a criticism of this novel it would be for the restrained nature in which it is presented. Did Stevenson just let it all go? Did he give us more elaborate details of Hyde’s excursions? Was Jekyll’s glee in Hyde’s adventures more fully explored? I understand Stevenson was a fiery Scot given to flights of temper that could only be doused with something as dramatic as throwing 30,000 words into the fire, but how about flinging the pages about the room, and storming away followed by the proper slamming of a door to punctuate displeasure. In my mind’s eye I can see his stepson, Lloyd Osborne, carefully gathering the pages, scaring himself reading them in the middle of the night, and keeping them for all posterity between the leaves of a writing journal.

In 1920 John Barrymore played Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.Stevenson was obsessed with the concept of good and evil. We all have a side to our personality that we prefer to keep hidden. We all wear masks. For now our inner thoughts are still our own, but don’t be surprised if the NSA has figured out how to tap in and tape those as well. Sometimes wearing the mask becomes arduous. Another entity fights to be allowed to roam free. We want to be impulsive, self-gratifying, slutty, sometimes brutal, but most importantly unfettered by our reputations. I wouldn’t necessarily call that evil, but there are people who do have true viciousness barely contained and we have to hope they continue to restrain it. The Victorians identified with Jekyll/Hyde and maybe to know that others are also struggling with doing right without doing wrong certainly made them feel less like an aberration when they next felt the itch for the East End. I’m sure this book was the source of many fine conversations as they drank their gin and smelled the musky hair of the doxie on their laps. 

The author with his wife and their household in Vailima, Samoa, c. 1892 Photograph of Robert Louis Stevenson and family, Vailima, on the island of Upolu in Samoa. Left to right: Mary Carter, maid to Stevenson's mother, Lloyd Osbourne, Stevenson's stepson, Margaret Balfour, Stevenson's mother, Isobel Strong, Stevenson's stepdaughter, Robert Louis Stevenson, Austin Strong, the Strong's son, Stevenson's wife Fanny Stevenson, and Joseph Dwight Strong, Isobel's husband.The word that most of his friends and acquaintances used to describe Stevenson (RLS as I often think of him) was captivating. He was sorely missed when he made the decision to move to Samoa taking himself a long way from supportive friends and his fans. He was searching for a healthy environment that would restore his always ailing health. Unfortunately the new climate was found too late, he died at the age of 44 from a brain aneurysm leaving his last novel, the Weir of Hermiston, unfinished. Many believe that he was on the verge of writing his greatest novel. Oddly enough, F. Scott Fitzgerald a very different writer from RLS, but also a favorite of mine died at 44 as well. Critics also believe that The Last Tycoon would have been his best novel if he’d had time to finish it. It does make me wonder about the wonderful stories that were left forever trapped in the now long silent pens of RLS and FSF, but they both left lasting monuments to literature. Even those that don’t appreciate their writing the way I do still have to admit that their impact was undeniable.

Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions;Edwin A. Abbott;1884;1880;96;3.81;71883;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Mathematics', 'Fantasy', 'Philosophy', 'Literature'];"This masterpiece of science (and mathematical) fiction is a delightfully unique and highly entertaining satire that has charmed readers for more than 100 years. The work of English clergyman, educator and Shakespearean scholar Edwin A. Abbott (1838-1926), it describes the journeys of A. Square [sic – ed.], a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women-thin, straight lines-are the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status.Through strange occurrences that bring him into contact with a host of geometric forms, Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions), Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions—a revolutionary idea for which he is returned to his two-dimensional world. Charmingly illustrated by the author, Flatland is not only fascinating reading, it is still a first-rate fictional introduction to the concept of the multiple dimensions of space. ""Instructive, entertaining, and stimulating to the imagination."" — Mathematics Teacher.";"When you read this book, keep two things in mind. First, it was written back in 1880, when relativity had not yet been invented, when quantum theory was not yet discovered, when only a handful of mathematicians had the courage (yet) to challenge Euclid and imagine curved space geometries and geometries with infinite dimensionality. As such, it is an absolutely brilliant work of speculative mathematics deftly hidden in a peculiar but strangely amusing social satire.Second, its point, even about itself, is still as apropos today as it was then. We still do not really know what the true dimensionality of the Universe is. It seems somehow unlikely that it is just ""four"", even in terms of spacetime dimensions. String theory talks seriously about thousands of dimensions. Quantum theory implements very seriously infinite numbers of dimensions. And yet we are still stuck in our 3 space dimensions mentally, hardly able to visualize the 4 in which we live ""properly"" unless we study theoretical physics for a decade or three, and utterly unable to mentally imagine those four embedded in a veritable Hilbert's Grand Hotel of dimensions.Ultimately, this is a book about keeping an open mind. A really open mind -- avoiding the trap of scientific materialism and the trap of theistic idealism and the trap of any other favorite -ism you might come up with. Our entire visible space-time continuum could be nothing more than a single thin page in an infinitely thick book of similar pages, that book one of an infinite number of similar books on an infinite shelf, that shelf but one such shelf in an infinite bookcase of shelves, that bookcase but one in an infinite library of bookcases, that library but one... but by now you get the idea.We have a hard time opening our minds up to the enormous range of possibilities, preferring to live our lives mentally trapped in a single tiny period on just one of those pages, in pointland. We may be quite unable to actually perceive the space in which our tiny point is embedded, but our minds are capable of conceiving it, and Abbot's lovely parable is a mind-expanding work to those who choose to read it that way.rgb";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433567.Flatland
The Time Machine;H.G. Wells;1895;1890;118;3.89;529841;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Time Travel', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook'];“I’ve had a most amazing time....”So begins the Time Traveller’s astonishing firsthand account of his journey 800,000 years beyond his own era—and the story that launched H.G. Wells’s successful career and earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine’s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.  There he discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.  Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to Wells’s expert storytelling and provocative insight, The Time Machine will continue to enthrall readers for generations to come.;"One of the most difficult courses I took in college was a class called Sociological Theory. The professor was either brilliant or a total nut, I’m still not sure, and one of the questions for our final exam was actually: Why? (Use diagrams to support your response).Ugh, ugh, ugh!!! I walked out of that class with a B and I kid you not, I have never worked so hard for a B in my life! I pity the one guy in my class who walked away with an A and don’t even want to think about what his social life was like during that semester because I know mine was down the tubes.At one point, the kooky prof mentioned The Time Machine as some interesting (but not required) reading to pick up on the side. But since he already had us reading upwards of 1,000 pages a week and we were required to hand in a 7-10 page paper every Monday (just for the one class!!!!), I was like, “screw you! H.G. Wells can kiss my ass!” And that’s the funny thing about regret. Because now I’m wishing I’d have made time in my busy schedule to read it. Maybe I should have blown off another class for a couple hours so I could have read The Time Machine. And then I could have thought about it in a state of mind that was open and receptive to what was being said and layering it with some weird, academic extrapolations and connections (the kind professors slurp up) and it would become something ultra-meaningful and profound. Or something. But no, I read it now. At age 29. Because I was dragging my feet and didn’t feel like finishing the book I’m supposed to be reading about Al Qaeda. And so the entire time I was reading it, I was like, “hm, interesting. If I was a younger person and still remembered the specific details about theories I studied in my past life as a student, the ideas in this book would have given me a nerd brain orgasm. And hot diggity damn! This book would have made a fantastic paper for my Soc. Theory class! By referencing several schools of sociological thought and combining those with discussions of evolution, social deconstruction and combining all that with the social norms of Victorian peoples—that would have knocked that prof’s socks off!""So anyway. I liked this book okay. I’m really not a huge science fiction fan and that aspect probably kept me from getting into it as much as I could have given its potential for creating nerd brain o’s. Plus, it was only 90 pages long. It’s hard to really get into something that’s that short. Parts of the story felt like they weren’t fleshed out enough and Wells seemed to have skimmed over several scenes that shouldn’t have been skimped on. But then I found out that his original intent for this story was to turn it into a full-fledged novel but that just never happened due to some financial burdens and it sort of made sense.The basic plot revolves around a Victorian gentleman and his theories about time travel. To prove them, he builds a machine and travels 800,000 years into the future where he befriends a group of people, the Eloi, who are descended from modern human beings. They are much shorter, childlike people who only eat fruit and spend most of their day playing games. They have no concept of work, they have no critical thinking skills and are incapable of logical reaction to problems. They are also terrified of the dark. After spending a few days with them, the Time Traveler discovers another distinct species, also descended from modern man but of a much more sinister nature. This second group lives underground, only comes out at night, is a bit more cunning than the gentle people who live aboveground and this group is also extremely predatory in that they cannibalize the Eloi. These are the Morlocks. The Time Traveler has several adventures during his time spent amongst the Eloi and the Morlocks and towards the end of the story, Wells makes some fairly blatant comparisons between the Eloi and the ultra-rich of our own society. If they spend their entire days being attended to by others, they will lose the ability to care for themselves and if they’re not careful, over the course of time and evolution of the species, they could turn into the Eloi, a group of wimpy wimpsters upon whom a life of privilege has backfired.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2493.The_Time_Machine
The War of the Worlds;H.G. Wells;1898;1890;192;3.83;322196;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Horror', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];When an army of invading Martians lands in England, panic and terror seize the population. As the aliens traverse the country in huge three-legged machines, incinerating all in their path with a heat ray and spreading noxious toxic gases, the people of the Earth must come to terms with the prospect of the end of human civilization and the beginning of Martian rule.Inspiring films, radio dramas, comic-book adaptations, television series and sequels,The War of the Worlds is a prototypical work of science fiction which has influenced every alien story that has come since, and is unsurpassed in its ability to thrill, well over a century since it was first published.;Paraphrasing Whitehead, I would say that the safest general characterisation of the science-fiction tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to H. G. Wells. Indeed, The War of the Worlds is probably the most influential novel of the whole science fiction genre, as well as a significant part of the horror category. I remember reading this short novel as a child and being viscerally engrossed and terrified. Rereading it now made me aware of a few more things. First, I realised how this book sums up and, in a way, accomplishes some of the things H. G. Wells had experimented with before. To name a few: the Darwinian conflict between two similar species (The Time Machine), the fascination for freakish life forms (The Island of Dr Moreau), the chase around working-class London and its surrounding area (The Invisible Man).It is possible that H. G. Wells’s remarkable book was perceived, at the close of the 19th century, as just a fin de siècle catastrophic story — similar to, say, Mad Max or Terminator at the end of the 20th. In hindsight, The War of the Worlds is much more than that. It is indeed the kernel and the seed of all the later tales of extraterrestrial invasion and tropes of apocalyptic destruction, from H. P. Lovecraft’s The Colour Out of Space to Arthur C. Clarke’s Childhood's End, Robert Heinlein’s The Puppet Masters, Ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles, Arkady Strugatsky’s Roadside Picnic, Michael Faber’s Under the Skin, Ted Chiang’s Story of Your Life, or Jeff VanderMeer’s Annihilation… Not to mention films and TV: Alien, Independence Day, and so many more that I forget as I write this short note.What strikes me the most is that Wells depicts humanity in the shoes of the invaded party and pictures the invaders as an alien race of bloodthirsty molluscs — which, in itself, sounds like a veiled but stark criticism of Western imperialism and sense of superiority. But, as it turns out, Wells’s prophetic vision was not so much that of a War of the Worlds with extraterrestrial invaders, but precisely a vision of the World War between fellow humans, that would break out some twenty years later, with a technological arsenal not unlike that of the Martians (cf. mechanised artillery, chemical warfare, surgical strikes). Later still, when the Second World War began, and the Nazis were about to invade the whole of Europe, Orson Welles remembered this old tale about a Martian invasion. He turned it into an incredibly relevant radio sensation. The masses of refugees, described by H. G. Wells, fleeing the war in a disorderly and life-threatening manner is a sight anyone may witness even today, despite all the concrete walls or steel fences that are supposed to stop them.In short, this is an unavoidable masterpiece. The only reproach I could make is regarding the ending. The deadly flu epidemic the Martians eventually suffer from feels a bit like a disappointing Deus ex Machina. As a side note: historically, things unfolded the other way around when Spanish Conquistadors landed on the shores of the New World. They didn’t win against the Aztec and Inca Empires so much because of the superiority of their weapons, religion or culture, but because they were bringing the smallpox virus along with them — the first major and unwitting case of biological warfare.Edit: Wells’s novel has been brought to the screen a significant number of times, one of the most recent ones being Steven Spielberg’s adaptation (2005) with Tom Cruise. The film takes a few liberties with the book, setting the story in present-day Connecticut. However, one very clever unfaithfulness is that the aliens do not come from Mars but from underground (a nod to The Time Machine, no doubt). Spielberg isn’t new to the alien-first-contact genre. But this is an outright nightmarish and nail-biting take on what had once been a benevolent musical spaceship or a heart-warming horticultural E.T. longing for home — in this film, aliens also play the trombone and are versed in landscaping. Still, they spray their gardens with human blood. Spielberg’s War of the Worlds comes after the intense and graphic scenes of the Omaha Beach assault in Saving Private Ryan and is roughly in the same vein. Some scenes, like the innumerable bodies, suddenly floating down a glistening river, or the empty cloths raining from a blazing sky, are strangely beautiful and horrifying. In the midst of the gruesome devastation, Tom Cruise, Tim Robbins and Dakota Fanning are exceptional, playing the parts of regular people, suddenly overwhelmed with PTSD and facing the brutal ending of all things.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8909.The_War_of_the_Worlds
The Invisible Man;H.G. Wells;1897;1890;192;3.63;199019;no;['Classics', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Literature'];This masterpiece of science fiction is the fascinating story of Griffin, a scientist who creates a serum to render himself invisible, and his descent into madness that follows.;"This is the story of how one angry, naked, sneezing albino managed to terrorize the English countryside. To be quite honest, I expected a bit more from the people who fended off the Nazis for years. But Wells seemed to think his fellow countrymen would be a bit too inept to toss a sheet over this shivering bastard and punch him in the throat. Instead?This:Attention:1) There may be spoilers for this 100+ year old book in the review.2) Only comment if you have a WORKING sense of humor.3) Seriously. Read # 2 again before you correct my review.When I first started reading, I assumed that The Invisible Man would be about a guy who was slowly driven mad by this unusual condition.Nope.He was a world class douchebag long before embarking on his experiment to become see-through. Although, if I had to point out one major difference between his beginning vs. his end? Well, I'm guessing his dick & balls hadn't permanently retreated into his body before he became the World's Meanest Nudist. Really, dude? Really? Winter is not kind to naked folks. As every Mad Scientist will tell you, you've got to plan ahead. Mother Nature will not bend to your nefarious whims! Turn on the Weather Channel next time, moron.So, Griffin (that's the Invisible Man's name) discovers a magic not magic formula that allows his molecules to have fewer surfaces for light to refract off, and if he combines that with electrocuting not electrocuting himself with some sort of a radio wave contraption, he will become invisible.Pseudo-science, FTW! He tested it out on a cat, and it sorta worked. Except for the cat's eyes. Don't worry, though. The cat is fine! Kidding it's totally dead.One thing I found interesting was that until his body absorbed food, it remained visible. Which led me to spend quite a bit of my afternoon thinking about whether or not you could see his poop moving through his intestines. And if it did remain visible, that meant his Kryptonite could quite literally be cheese! Think about it, people. You could track him if he's constipated!Ha! I'll bet those assholes at MENSA are totally rethinking that rejection letter now.Yeah, so all they had to do was get a big cauldron (or Fry-Daddy) bubbling with oil, and then cook up a shit ton of mozzarella sticks. If placed strategically around the village, they could have had Griffin backed up and praying for prunes in no time. Between the groaning and visibly distended intestines, it would have been Problem Solved within two days. BOOM!Ok, so Wells does his dead-level best to make invisibility seem like a curse, but the reality was this was an AWESOME power. He's fucking invisible!The only reason Griffin wasn't immediately the richest man in the kingdom was due to his a-hole personality. All he had to do was tell people about his amazing discovery! Instead, he shoots himself in the dick trying to keep it a secret. Sure, the people in that first hillbilly town might not have been receptive. At least, not at first, anyway...Witchcraft! Kill it with fire, Cletus!But show up at a Science Fair (or wherever smart people hang out), and he would have been carried off on his peers' weak & nerdy shoulders!I mean, his buddy Kemp was thoroughly impressed...until he started voluntarily boasting about his somewhat ill-thought-out crimes, and revealing his idiotic plans for world domination. Which, by the way, was the least well-planned villain plot...ever...in the history of badly planned villain plots! Terror? A reign of 
terror
? That's it?! What's the endgame, Griffin?Give me all your money! Or Terror!Make me king of the world! Or Terror!WTF, man? I think you're overestimating yourself a bit there...Sure, it's a bit spooky that you can't be seen, but eventually, even the stupidest of villagers will band together & figure out that you can be taken down by a dog with a good nose...or cheese!Which is pretty much what happens.Except for the part about cheese. If only they had consulted someone with my level of genius intellect, poor Adye would still be alive. Tsk.He stupidly tries to implement his Reign of Terror, and manages to get a few good shots in, but eventually becomes the recipient of the ass beating of a lifetime.Moral of the story: Even if you're a genius, don't be a dick.You will inevitably freeze your balls off, catch a nasty cold, and end up bludgeoned to death by people with half your intellect.

The Island of Dr. Moreau;H.G. Wells;1896;1890;160;3.73;123922;no;['Classics', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Literature'];Librarian note: An alternative cover for this ISBN can be found here.Ranked among the classic novels of the English language and the inspiration for several unforgettable movies, this early work of H. G. Wells was greeted in 1896 by howls of protest from reviewers, who found it horrifying and blasphemous. They wanted to know more about the wondrous possibilities of science shown in his first book, The Time Machine, not its potential for misuse and terror. In The Island of Dr. Moreau, a shipwrecked gentleman named Edward Prendick, stranded on a Pacific island lorded over by the notorious Dr. Moreau, confronts dark secrets, strange creatures, and a reason to run for his life.While this riveting tale was intended to be a commentary on evolution, divine creation, and the tension between human nature and culture, modern readers familiar with genetic engineering will marvel at Wells’s prediction of the ethical issues raised by producing “smarter” human beings or bringing back extinct species. These levels of interpretation add a richness to Prendick’s adventures on Dr. Moreau’s island of lost souls without distracting from what is still a rip-roaring good read.;Welcoming the body horror genre, paired with a classical mad scientists´ approach towards progressive research methods and creating special forms of new life, Wells shows how secret living biological weapons programs were done in the good, old, elitist days. Luckily, science has evolved and today´s resident evil style chimeras are much more sophisticated and produced in hidden secret professional public private partnership military industrial complex hives. Wells puts a lot in this short one, human nature, ethics of science, evolution, culture, tradition, genetics, epigenetic, torture medicine, ironic innuendos towards the ideological waves of his time I may be just imagining or not understanding, some really good shock and wtf moments, and in general a realistic and early view on what genetic engineering will have still hidden in the cards held by tentacles, fingers, and whatever one doesn´t want to think of in detail.As I always tend to say, who controls biotechnology and nanotechnology in the future will rule earth, it´s comparable to guns, agriculture, writing, engines, etc. States without the key technologies will fade away and be forgotten in future history just as stone age tribes, sitting on dead, devasted earth while the new superpowers will first mine the solar system and later the rest of the galaxy. Hopefully, they will send subsidies and development aid to their primitive predecessors on the once blue planet. One could also see this as an allegory of how modern people of these days tended to look at animals and indigenous people, how all that racism and colonial megalomania provided the ground for fascism and white supremacy, and what weird dudes the people in the 19th and beginning 20th century must have been. Today they would be commuting between the psychiatric hospitals, prisons, and extremist groups´ and parties´ meetings. A few years ago I would have cited some of my favorite sci-fi authors or created some fictional news quotes, but thanks to CRISPR, biotechnology, and general technological singularity with many departments needed to play flying spaghetti monster, the science articles and research is coming closer and closer to a mixture of these old ideas and my beloved Resident evil series.It´s going to come, it will be done, and I will want to be or have a modified…hm. Eagle, bear, bonobo… Tricky, I ought choose wisely, because it might take a few months or even years to switch species, gender, age, personality, etc. again.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29981.The_Island_of_Dr_Moreau

The Lost World;Arthur Conan Doyle;1912;1910;272;3.93;68379;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Dinosaurs'];It's London, 1907. Journalist Edward Malone, rejected by the woman he loves because he is too prosaic, decides to go in search of adventure and fame to prove himself worthy of her. Soon after, he meets Professor George Challenger, a scientist who claims to have discovered a 'lost world' populated by pterodactyls and other prehistoric monsters.;"Move aside, Sherlock…Sir Arthur has conjured a protagonist who's an even more arrogant assbag than you. Everyone...the intrepid, the indefatigable, the insufferable Professor G.E. Challenger…

If, like me, you enjoy characters that are gruff, prideful curmudgeonly sorts, than you will have fun with this guy. He is a serious hoot. Trust me.  Physically, Prof. Challenger is a funhouse mirror reflection of Mr. Holmes. Instead of a tall, lanky, clean-shaven gentlemen who calmly condescends to the world around him, we have a short, barrel-chested, physically imposing caveman, with a booming voice and serious anger management issues. 

Tell me he doesn't look like the spitting image of Bluto...from Popeye. Hmmm?Intellectually, however, Challenger is definitely a pea from the same pompous pod as Doyle's most famous literary creation. Zero charm, no social graces and a chip on his shoulder the size of Gibraltar. He is a serious piece of unrestrained windbaggery that pins the needle on the Arrogasshat Pricktardo Scale. And he doled out some serious happy to me while I reading. Like Holmes, of whom I am a screaming fanboy, I found G.E. Challenger to be enormously fun to listen to as he waxed vaingloriously about his greatness and scientific acumen. While I wouldn't want to spend any real-life time socializing with the ill-mannered prig, as a literary companion he's an absolute blast. I can think of no better way to introduce you to the professor, and his over-the-top disagreeability, than the method employed by Doyle to unveil him to readers of The Lost World. When reporter Edward Malone (hiding his true vocation) requests a meeting with the reclusive scientist, this is the letter he receives in reply. 
SIR, I have duly received your note, in which you claim to endorse my views, although I am not aware that they are dependent upon endorsement either from you or anyone else. You have ventured to use the word “speculation” with regard to my statement upon the subject of Darwinism, and I would call your attention to the fact that such a word in such a connection is offensive to a degree. The context convinces me, however, that you have sinned rather through ignorance and tactlessness than through malice, so I am content to pass the matter by. You quote an isolated sentence from my lecture, and appear to have some difficulty in understanding it. I should have thought that only a sub-human intelligence could have failed to grasp the point, but if it really needs amplification I shall consent to see you at the hour named, though visits and visitors of every sort are exceeding distasteful to me. As to your suggestion that I may modify my opinion, I would have you know that it is not my habit to do so after a deliberate expression of my mature views. You will kindly show the envelope of this letter to my man, Austin, when you call, as he has to take every precaution to shield me from the intrusive rascals who call themselves “journalists.” Yours faithfully,     GEORGE EDWARD CHALLENGER.
 Yes...he's like that. Plus he's violent, quick-tempered, pig-headed, racist, elitist, and is not above putting his wife in ""time out"" when he feels she has misbehaved. Yeah, he's pretty much the whole package of awesome. Once I read that, I knew I was in for something loaded with win.  PLOT SUMMARY: Not sure this is really necessary, so I will keep this brief. As the title suggests, this is one of the archetypes of the “lost world” genre and Sir Arthur brings his usual skill to its execution. A journalist (the aforementioned Edward Malone) eager to impress his girlfriend, requests a dangerous assignment. He lands a doozy when an expedition is planned to prove (or disprove) Challenger's claim of having discovered an isolated region of the Amazon inhabited by dinosaurs, pterodactyls and other extinct and exotic creatures. Together with Challenger, another professor (the obligatory skeptic), and Lord Roxton, the standard rough and ready adventurer, the four embark on their fateful quest.Frills, thrills, spills, chills and kills ensue...in abundance.THOUGHTS: This is by the numbers storytelling for this sub genre, but Doyle’s talent and engaging prose make it a lot of fun. It's a given that the fantastic elements of the story have, to an extent, lost their ability to deliver the WOW that they originally produced, and the book's sense of depicting the truly wondrous does suffer a bit as a result. Still, I was pleasantly surprised at how engaging the narrative was and how much fun I had listening to Challenger and his colleagues expound with fervor on their dated scientific theories. Excellent storytelling has no expiration date, and Doyle, like contemporaries H.G. Wells and Jules Verne, has the ability to engage and captivate his audience with the wonders of a bygone age.  I enjoyed myself, Sir Arthur. Thank you. 3.5 stars. Recommended!!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10155.The_Lost_World
A Princess of Mars;Edgar Rice Burroughs;1912;1910;186;3.81;58291;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Pulp', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];A Princess of Mars is the first of eleven thrilling novels that comprise Edgar Rice Burroughs' most exciting saga, known as The Martian Series. It's the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which John Carter, a gentleman from Virginia and a Civil War veteran, unexpectedly finds himself on to the red planet, scene of continuing combat among rival tribes. Captured by a band of six-limbed, green-skinned savage giants called Tharks, Carter soon is accorded all the honor of a chieftain after it's discovered that his muscles, accustomed to Earth's greater gravity, now give him a decided advantage in strength. And when his captors take as prisoner Dejah Thoris, the lovely human-looking princess of the city of Helium, Carter must call upon every ounce of strength, courage, and ingenuity to rescue her-before Dejah becomes the slave of the depraved Thark leader, Tal Hajus!;"Some years back David Bowie asked the musical question, ""Is there life on Mars?"" Had he read A Princess of Mars he might have known the answer. Back in the early 60’s I fell in love. Not with a girl, (well, there were one or two cracks opened in that young heart, but we do not speak of that now) but with reading. And the brazen hussy that led me down that path was none other than Edgar Rice Burroughs. Of course there were others, all vying for my immature attention, Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, H.G. Wells, Robert Heinlein, Jules Verne, and plenty more from that gang of idiots. I remember the glee I felt when a parcel would arrive, the soft packaging that sprinkled to the floor if you opened the pull-tag a little too energetically. Lift the treasure to your nose and inhale deeply. No, wiseass, no glue involved. No glue actually needed. Paperbacks, Ace and Ballantine mostly. This was the way I got one of my first scents of the lifetime of reading that awaited. It was intoxicating. Prime among the treasures to be found in those bags were the Barsoom novels of ERB. I followed the adventures of John Carter the way readers of a certain detective followed his exploits in issues of The Strand. Reading ERB as a kid was one of the best things about being a kid. So one might imagine the anticipation bubbling up when I learned that a film was in the offing. Good, bad or mediocre, this was must-see territory. And to prepare it seemed that, fifty years after having first encountered Barsoom through books, it was worth giving at least some of the books a second look.Taylor Kitsch as John Carter in the filmJohn Carter, a soldier (Civil War veteran), mercenary, and apparently occasional miner, begins on Earth. He is trapped in a cave by hostile forces, when he wishes himself, pretty much, to Mars, the god of his profession. The film of course had to come up with a better excuse than that. He is taken prisoner by a group of Tharks, a race of six-limbed, twelve-to-fifteen foot tall green warriors (think taller, thinner, ancestors of Klingons), led by one of their less bloodthirsty sorts, a fellow named Tars Tarkas. Tars Tarkas - from the filmTT was most impressed by JC’s fighting prowess and his ability to leap tall building in a single bound, a benefit of having muscles adapted to the much higher gravity on a different planet. (ERB’s hero appears twenty years before that Kal-el character, and Jerry Siegel has said that JC was indeed influential in the creation of that better known super-guy.) Tarkas and Carter find common cause eventually and thus begins a beautiful friendship. TT had put a guard dog (actually a Shetland-size, many-tusked critter called a  calot ) in charge of JC. But as the locals treat their gigantic ferocious domestic critters rather harshly, it turned out to be receptive to JC’s kinder treatment, so we add a loyal-to-death pet, with the blood-curdling name ""Woola"" for our hero. Can the girl be far behind? Not a chance.Woola - from the film. What a cutie!After the Tharkian horde does battle with a race of human-like sorts, they take a prisoner, a female. Dejah Thoris is princess of the city-state of Helium (and no she does not speak with a silly-high voice) and of the book title, and is notable for her regal bearing, smokin’ looks and courage under duress. (The film pads her resume with some science credits) Having established his warrior cred by kicking several Tharkian butts, JC has some wiggle room among Thark society and manages to learn a fair bit. He is, naturally, curious about the new resident.Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris - from the filmOh, there is one other item missing from the checklist, the baddie. Well, there are several, a crude Thark leader, monsters aplenty, but most of all a professional sneak-thief-liar-betrayer of a Thark named Sarkoja, who does all she can to foil TT and JC in whatever they might want to do. All she lacks is a broom and some striped socks. [The film includes her, but substitutes a different evil-doer for many of the story’s later intrigues.]Ok, so this is not exactly great literature. Sweden will not be calling any time soon. Carter finds himself in a seemingly endless series of battles, large and small. People are captured. People fight. People flee. Friends help friends. Baddies behave badly. No one really changes much. Oh, they rise in rank and esteem, and prove their mettle, and some character is revealed in time, but really, nothing is told about these people that we did not know very early on. There is silliness and many shortcuts are taken. ERB makes use of deus ex machina so much he must have had a mechanic on call. Carter learns that a large amount of Martian communications occurs via telepathy and bingo, he is telepathic too. What luck! Also, Martian language has devolved to mostly a single tongue. No, really. And he learns it in a twinkling, with the help of a kindly female Thark named Sola. Whenever someone needs a rescue there is always a rescuer, either now or eventually. The cavalry comes riding over the hill a bit too often to avoid eye-rolling. The fights are pretty much pro-forma, with almost mandatory nods to the honor and skill of the thousands of opponents, after, of course, Carter knocks them out or kills them with a single blow to the chin. Puh-leez.  Edgar Rice Burroughs - image from BritannicaIn between, Burroughs offers bits and pieces of his vision of life on Mars. We learn how Thark children are joined with parents, get some info on Barsoomian visions of death and afterlife, consider a bit the problem of scarce air, and may wonder at the ancient human ruins now occupied by other species. They have some nifty tech on Barsoom as well, having discovered a special 9th ray of light that is used for energy. Radium is a useful power source as well. Airships of all sizes speed about, but seem to function mostly as boats with negative draft. There will be swashbuckling. There are some elements in the book that do not travel well through the years. The women have some wonderful qualities but there is little equality to be found. Also, slavery is still a very active element of Martian society, and while ERB shows sundry characters shackled to those chains, and does his best to free those, he does not seem all that upset about the institution. In one commentary on communistic elements of Tharkian society, ERB notes Owning everything in common, even to your women and children, has resulted in your owning nothing in common.This was published in 1912, so a quote like this might not have stuck out so much back then. Of course there are many much more ancient items that seem quaint today, such as You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your neighbor's.I guess ownership is in the eye of the beholder. Social systems seem to be widely of the royal persuasion, although combat figures large in determining leadership in some groups. And just as girls have been led to hope for a prince to come to the rescue, so here our hero is not panting after any ordinary female. Dejah is a bona fide, card-carrying princess. Then, there are some elements that might stand up rather well. Carter applies his knowledge of animals to persuade the locals to treat their beasties much better. The moral superiority of races is not at all determined by color, or in this case, even sentient species. Honesty, motherhood, and I am certain that if the ingredients grew there, apple pie would come in for some ERB support. Courage is also a highly valued trait. Physical prowess in battle is paramount here. Frank Schoonover's cover illustration for the first book version-from WikipediaOk, so bottom line. This is a very dated book. It is, after all, over one hundred years old. It contains antiquated, sometimes offensive notions. Many of the characters are pretty thinly drawn. But this was not intended to be a thoughtful, adult novel. It is pulp fiction, literally, as Barsoom made its first public appearance in All-Story Magazine in 1912, and its focus is on three things, action, action and action. Burroughs was appalled that people got paid to write the trash that appeared in such publications and said, “I could write stories just as rotten.” If that is ok with you, then A Princess of Mars is a fun read, a buddy movie with a bit of love interest, (no real sex, although a fair bit of nakedness) a lot of fighting, capturing and being captured and escaping, a nifty vision of a faraway place. Overall, good fun. It helps to be a ten-year-old boy. Look at those cavemen go.=============================EXTRA STUFFThe home page for Edgar Rice Burroughs, the corporation, where you will learn that

The Gods of Mars;Edgar Rice Burroughs;1913;1910;190;3.88;19600;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Adventure', 'Pulp', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];After the long exile on Earth, John Carter finally returned to his beloved Mars. But beautiful Dejah Thoris, the woman he loved, had vanished. Now he was trapped in the legendary Eden of Mars -- an Eden from which none ever escaped alive.The Gods of Mars is a science fantasy novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, the second of his Barsoom series. It was first published in The All-Story as a five-part serial in the issues for January-May 1913.[1] It was later published as a complete novel by A. C. McClurg in September, 1918.Excerpt:For moments after that awful laugh had ceased reverberating through the rocky room, Tars Tarkas and I stood in tense and expectant silence. But no further sound broke the stillness, nor within the range of our vision did aught move.At length Tars Tarkas laughed softly, after the manner of his strange kind when in the presence of the horrible or terrifying. It is not an hysterical laugh, but rather the genuine expression of the pleasure they derive from the things that move Earth men to loathing or to tears.Often and again have I seen them roll upon the ground in mad fits of uncontrollable mirth when witnessing the death agonies of women and little children beneath the torture of that hellish green Martian fete-the Great Games.I looked up at the Thark, a smile upon my own lips, for here in truth was greater need for a smiling face than a trembling chin.;"Rolling ochre sea bottom of long dead seas, low surrounding hills, with here and there the grim and silent cities of the dead past; great piles of mighty architecture tenanted only by age-old memories of a once powerful race, and by the great white apes of Barsoom.If anything, Edgar Rice Burroughs is the founding father of the guilty pleasure. No, these books aren’t literary masterpieces. No, these books are not politically correct. But damn they’re fun to read! There was a brief and futile effort of defence. Then silence as the huge, repulsive shapes covered the bodies of their victims and scores of sucking mouths fastened themselves to the flesh of their prey.Over the top Sword and Planet fare… this is the stuff that pre-teen dreams are made of. Gods of Mars is fairly violent, even for this kind of thing, and there is a lot of “cleaving” and “crushing” filling the pages. Robert E. Howard and the other pulp writers no doubt drew a lot of inspiration from here.What was that! A faint shuffling sounded behind me, and as I cast a hasty glance over my shoulder my blood froze in my veins for the thing I saw there.The religious theme (or theme of deception through the abuse of religious belief) present here is interesting. This kind of thing is commonplace in Science Fiction today, but it doesn’t strike me as ERB’s style. Could be worth further investigation…I put the thought of death out of my mind, and fell upon my antagonists with fury that those who escaped will remember to their dying day.Burroughs did seem to rehash some plot events every now and again. There are things happening here that I could have sworn I’d also read in one of the many Tarzan novels. Typical example: door slams shut behind protagonist, plunging him in darkness… followed by maniacal laughter. The feelings of Phaidor toward John Carter, and the circumstances under which they occur, also mirror the relationship between La (of Opar) and Tarzan. To a tee. Sparks flew as steel smote steel, and then there was the dull and sickening sound of a shoulder bone parting beneath the keen edge of my Martian sword.As campy and old school as this is, I struggle to find it in myself to entirely dislike it. It is the product of an era, and it’s only fair that it be treated as such. Expect any number of coincidences that aid the “good guys” on their way. But hey, nobody said this was high literature. In the end, the baddies are all fodder and John Carter lives to fight another day, and another, and another. No, this isn’t a spoiler, unless you’ve been asleep under a Martian stone. Back and forth across the room we surged, until the floor was ankle deep in blood, and dead men lay so thickly there that half the time we stood upon their bodies as we fought.What fun!Better judgment has no place in this review. Four stars.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/841973.The_Gods_of_Mars
The Warlord of Mars;Edgar Rice Burroughs;1919;1910;6;3.87;14990;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Adventure', 'Pulp', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];John Carter risks everything to rescue his wife, Princess Dejah Thoris, from the clutches of his evil adversaries, but he is always just one step behind! His battles cover the face of the red planet, as his quest carries him ultimately to the mysterious northern pole. Will this civilization, submerged in ice, prove fatal to our hero? This is the third of eleven in the popular 'Martian' series by Edgar Rice Burroughs.Duration: 5 hr., 48 min.;"More hectic adventures for John Carter on Mars Barsoom!

He jumps right back into the action, immediately following the crazed cliffhanger of the preceding Gods of Mars! He's going to save his wife and mother of his son Dejah Thoris and her new bff Thuvia come hell or high water! He's no wimpy regular sorta guy, he's the greatest warrior of two worlds! He's going to hop all over Mars with his super-powered leaps, wearing nothing but his skin! Pity the fool that gets in his way! He won't take no for an answer!

I should have read this third book right after the second one because they are basically one book! Maybe I would have liked it better if I had! But I'm not going to cry over lost opportunities because John Carter would no doubt smack me upside the head! He'd probably tell me to stop mooning over lost opportunities because he misses opportunities all the time and he still manages to come out on top! He just can't abide any sort of wimpy mooniness because that's so typical of the Earth Men he gladly left behind!

But I sure do wish I liked this one as much as I liked the first two books! The adventures run between Mars' two poles, helter and skelter, willy and nilly, and I kinda got lost in all the breathlessness! Not lost like confused but lost like Uh Do I Even Care About This Anymore Where Is He Now Exactly Eh Whatever Just Keep On Reading! It all just felt like a whole lotta running around so I didn't ever get a sense of the places that I was visiting! I missed the exotic worldbuilding and sly social critiques and the riveting cast of supporting characters! Well at least there was John Carter's trusty 10-legged ""dog"" companion Woola! But then he gets sent off on his own mission halfway through the book and so that was that, goodbye! Farewell sweet Woola!

I especially missed the weirdly resonant primary-colored races of Barsoomians where Burroughs is at his best! Lots of interesting social and political critique there! All of that was kinda lacking in this book! I wanted more of those Red Men and Green Men and Black Men and White Men! Instead we get these boring Yellow Men and all they are are black-bearded yell0w-skinned aristocrats, sorta like the White Men minus the religion and baldness and plus beards! There's nothing all that interesting about them except they live in hothouses on the South Pole and like every other race of men on Mars, they think wearing clothes is for losers! Well at least they built an interesting defensive weapon: a giant tower that's like a big magnet that pulls those Red Men-built airships out of the sky to fall into a junk heap where survivors get gobbled up by gross insect-eyed albino ape creatures! Ouch! And yuck!

Even though I was disappointed I think I'm gonna keep on keepin' on with this series! On to the next one!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40379.The_Warlord_of_Mars
Thuvia, Maid of Mars;Edgar Rice Burroughs;1916;1910;160;3.76;9553;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Adventure', 'Pulp', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"Mars has become divided by love. Not one, but two princes and a Jeddak are vying for the love of Thuvia of Ptarth. When she is mysteriously kidnapped, treachery threatens to throw Barsoom into bloody war. Now Cathoris must follow in the footsteps of his father, John Carter, and overcome phantom armies, dangerous spies and savage beasts as he attempts to save his true love and reunite Mars. The fourth Martian novel from Burroughs.Excerpt:Upon a massive bench of polished ersite beneath the gorgeous blooms of a giant pimalia a woman sat. Her shapely, sandalled foot tapped impatiently upon the jewel-strewn walk that wound beneath the stately sorapus trees across the scarlet sward of the royal gardens of Thuvan Dihn, Jeddak of Ptarth, as a dark-haired, red-skinned warrior bent low toward her, whispering heated words close to her ear. ""Ah, Thuvia of Ptarth,"" he cried, ""you are cold even before the fiery blasts of my consuming love! No harder than your heart, nor colder is the hard, cold ersite of this thrice happy bench which supports your divine and fadeless form! Tell me, O Thuvia of Ptarth, that I may still hope-that though you do not love me now, yet some day, some day, my princess, I-"" The girl sprang to her feet with an exclamation of surprise and displeasure. Her queenly head was poised haughtily upon her smooth red shoulders. Her dark eyes looked angrily into those of the man.";The 4th installment of the John Carter/Barsoom series. I continue to be entertained by each and every tale Burroughs tells. I think this one has been my favorite so far!This story branches away from John Carter and Deja Thoris to focus on Carthoris and Thuvia - each played parts in the earlier stories. What was great is that it was not that hard to jump right into. The last two installments took much longer for me to get comfortable with.I love Burroughs' imagination. His creations hop off the page effortlessly and without feeling forced or silly. Also, the plot points throughout are clearly allegories for life on Earth at the time he wrote it (race, social status, wealth, bravery, ego, etc.) It's like each character is a parable our cautionary tale - this has been a part of every book so far. Very fascinating! If you are a sci fi fan and want to read the classics - this is it! Read this series!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40387.Thuvia_Maid_of_Mars
We;Yevgeny Zamyatin;1924;1920;256;3.89;100025;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Russia', 'Russian Literature', 'Literature'];The exhilarating dystopian novel that inspired George Orwell's 1984 and foreshadowed the worst excesses of Soviet RussiaYevgeny Zamyatin's We is a powerfully inventive vision that has influenced writers from George Orwell to Ayn Rand. In a glass-enclosed city of absolute straight lines, ruled over by the all-powerful 'Benefactor', the citizens of the totalitarian society of OneState live out lives devoid of passion and creativity - until D-503, a mathematician who dreams in numbers, makes a discovery: he has an individual soul. Set in the twenty-sixth century AD, We is the classic dystopian novel and was the forerunner of works such as George Orwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. It was suppressed for many years in Russia and remains a resounding cry for individual freedom, yet is also a powerful, exciting and vivid work of science fiction. Clarence Brown's brilliant translation is based on the corrected text of the novel, first published in Russia in 1988 after more than sixty years' suppression.;"George Orwell, you poser. You punk. You . . . thief! I heard that you had read this before writing 1984. But I didn't expect Zamyatin's writing to be so superior to yours. And it is. It is so much more intriguing than your sterile work. D-503 is so much the better character than Winston. And you rob I-333 of her power and respect by demoting Julia to the role of a sexual object that stirs Winston to action. Yes, D-503 is stirred to action by I-333, but she's the political activist, the intelligent one in this revolution. Besides, Zamyatin had the guts to apply a letter and a name to his characters, while your very English ""Winston"" makes your work smack of parochialism and, frankly, condescension. D-503 is the universal toadie and I-333 the universal revolutionary. ""Winston""? Really? Were you trying to evoke Churchill? Somehow I sense . . . Regardless of this, Zamyatin's prose is far better than yours. It never seems hackneyed, and rarely pedantic, though I suppose any novel that portrays rebellion against totalitarianism has to be somewhat pedantic. But because Zamyatin actually lived under a totalitarian state - TWO, actually! - and you only imagined what the Socialists would do in your imaginary world, he avoids much of the rhetoric that you seem to embrace, even while lampooning the imagined society of Big Brother.You see, despite his impersonal name, D-503 is so much more human than Winston. Yes, Winston is a revolutionary like D-503, but when I read him in comparison with the protagonist of We, Winston comes off as disingenuous. D-503 is the real deal, because Zamyatin was the real deal. The man was exiled by both the Tsar and the Communists for his free-thinking while you were worried about threats from within your country that never materialized. Maybe that's why 1984 feels so forced (remember that awful middle section outlining the world's politics - BORING!), while We feels so much more natural and easy to read.Furthermore, Zamyatin's prose is beautiful. Yes, you have the occasional turn of phrase that came out well, iconic, even, but Zamyatin's writing is beautiful throughout, even in its stochasticity. It's the writing of a poet who actually lived under totalitarianism, not a vested academic who feared a potential threat. You were fighting despotism, Zamyatin was living with it. You surmised, he knew.And for these reasons, I am doing the unprecedented (for me, at least): I am taking one of your stars and giving it to Zamyatin. Because, while his work isn't perfect, one must give credit where credit is due. Censorship, along with the the Cold War, gave you your day in the sun of America's high school classrooms, when, all along, those kids, myself included, should have been reading Zamyatin's work.That's an injustice. Maybe you're not totally to blame. Maybe Western society has to shoulder some of the guilt here. But . . . but . . . you copycat!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76171.We

Old man Rossum was a biologist who failed to create actual humans in his laboratory; engineer son Rossum invented the living labor machine, the Robot, a natural progression of production (son) following discovery (father). After all, as the present central director of R.U.R. states: “If you can’t do it faster than nature, what’s the point?” Let’s not forget this is 1920, the engineer is king and speed, machines, factories and efficiency are all the rage. Speed and machines even made headway in the world of art some year prior, especially among the Italian Futurists such as Mainetti, Boccioni and Bella.2. The central director continues: “Production should be as simple as possible and the product the best for its function.” And “The creation of an engineer is technically more refined than the product of nature.” The spirit of these statements was captured magnificently in the film “Modern Times” with Charlie Chaplin. Since the prologue is peppered alternately with satire, comedy and black humor, it’s as if the creators of that Chaplin film mined a number of ideas from Čapek’s play.3. Young Rossum started with twelve-foot Superrobots but they kept falling apart so he began manufacturing Robots of normal human height and respectable human shape. Curiously, when Robots mimic human dimensions, there is something inexplicably appealing about their physical presence. For example, witness the computer generated American football playing Robot one of the large commercial stations uses in their broadcasts – the Robot signals a first down, spikes the ball and even does a little dance after scoring a touchdown – all very charming for football fans – just Robot enough to be fantasy; just human enough to seemingly possess human emotions and feelings.4. A recent arrival to the R.U.R. factory, Helena, a sensitive young lady converses with the central director and mistakes the director’s beautiful secretary, a Robot named Sulla, for a real person. Oh, no, no! Helena is quite upset and initially refuses to belief such a gorgeous woman, just like herself, isn’t human. Ah, there’s something so very compelling about a woman’s beauty – we refuse to believe a young woman with such beauty lacks heart and feeling – case in point, the 2015 film “Ex Machina.”5. The way they are constructed, Robots never think up anything original. As the director notes: “They’d make fine university professors.” Did I mention Karel Čapek’s infusion of satire and black humor? Such a nice touch – not too much satire to sound preachy but enough to let us know much in his society and culture, all the flummery about “progress” and the eventual perfection and purification of mankind through scientism, is so much smoke and mirrors.6. Turns out Helena has traveled to the R.U.R. factory on behalf of the League of Humanity in order to incite and liberate the Robots. All the factory directors in the room, all six men, laugh and tell Helena everybody from the outside who comes to the factory wants to do good by the Robots and set them free. As the central director, Harry Domin, informs Helena: “It would amaze you to know how many churches and lunatics there are in the world.” Churches and lunatics . . . you gotta love it! As events unfold beginning in Act One, Helena’s words take on stinging irony.7. Helena wants to know if you can show the Robots a bit of love. Impossible, retorts the directors, since Robots are made for one and only one purpose: work. For Robots have no sense of taste nor do they ever smile. Considering how many 21st century factory Robots have been successfully constructed for nonstop work, this passage takes on a particular resonance. And, God forbid, if there is work where Robots can’t replace humans, there is always the opportunity to move your factory to a third world country and corral the poverty-stricken into your sweat-shop for next to nothing. Much of the themes of R.U.R. are as relevant today as they were in 1920.8. But, but, but . . . there is a chink in the armor. As one director sadly states: “Occasionally they go crazy somehow. Something like epilepsy, you know? We call it Robotic Palsy. All of a sudden one of them goes and breaks whatever it has in its hands, stops working, gnashes its teeth – and we have to send it to the stamping mill. Evidently a breakdown of the organism.” Sound like trouble? Such breakdowns prove to be big trouble.9. Powerful economic forces are at work. One of the directors pronounces how their Robots have cut the cost of labor, so much so that non-Robot factories are going belly-up. Many are the zingers the playwright hurls at a society reduced to the forces of supply and demand where the requirement to produce profits for shareholders takes top priority at the expense of humanity. Money, money, money . . . the lifeblood of the modern world then and now. 10. Harry Domin proclaims how no longer will mankind have to destroy his soul doing work he hates; people will live to perfect themselves. Considering the modern phenomenon of the couch potato and numerous other mind-numbing addictions, unfortunately there is substantial evidence the vast percentage of the population is far from “perfecting itself” given time free from work. So, Act One, Act Two, Act Three take place at the R.U.R. factory ten years after the prologue. It's Robots vs. humans. I encourage you to read the play to find out what happens. And I highly recommend this Penguin edition which includes a most informative introductory essay by Czeck writer Ivan Klima.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/436562.R_U_R_
Brave New World;Aldous Huxley;1932;1930;268;3.99;1902819;no;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'School'];"Aldous Huxley's profoundly important classic of world literature, Brave New World is a searching vision of an unequal, technologically-advanced future where humans are genetically bred, socially indoctrinated, and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian ruling order–all at the cost of our freedom, full humanity, and perhaps also our souls. “A genius [who] who spent his life decrying the onward march of the Machine” (The New Yorker), Huxley was a man of incomparable talents: equally an artist, a spiritual seeker, and one of history’s keenest observers of human nature and civilization. Brave New World, his masterpiece, has enthralled and terrified millions of readers, and retains its urgent relevance to this day as both a warning to be heeded as we head into tomorrow and as thought-provoking, satisfying work of literature. Written in the shadow of the rise of fascism during the 1930s, Brave New Worldd likewise speaks to a 21st-century world dominated by mass-entertainment, technology, medicine and pharmaceuticals, the arts of persuasion, and the hidden influence of elites. ""Aldous Huxley is the greatest 20th century writer in English."" —Chicago Tribune";"I need to parse my rating of this book into the good (or great), the bad and the very  fugly because I thought aspects of it were inspired genius and parts of it were dreggy, boring and living near the border of awful. In the end, the wowness and importance of the novel's ideas as well as the segments that I thoroughly enjoyed carried the book to a strong 3.5 star rating.THE REALLY GOOD/EXCELLENT - I loved the first third of the book in which the basic outline of the ""Brave New World"" and its devalued, conveyer belt morality is set forth. The narrative device employed by Huxley of having the Director of Hatchery and Conditioning provide a walking tour to students around the facility as a way to knowledge up the reader on the societal basics was perfect. We learn of the cloning/birthing process, the caste system and the fundamental tenets upon which the society is organized.

This was as good a use of infodumping exposition as I had come across in some time and I was impressed both with the content and delivery method. The reader gets a crash course in world and its history in a way that fit nicely into the flow of the narrative without ever feeling forced. This was easily the best part of the novel for me, and Huxley's mass production-based society of enforced hedonism and anti-emotion was very compelling. Sort of like... 

Now, long jumping to the end of the novel...I also thought the final ""debate"" near the story's climax between John (the ""savage"") and Mustapha Mond, the World Controller, was exceptional. This last chapter/ending of the book, while abrupt, was masterful and struck the proper chord with the overall theme of the book. Thus, a superior 4.5 to 5.0 stars for this portion of the book. THE BAD/AWFUL - I thought the middle of the book including both the trip to the ""reservation"" and John's initial return to London was a sleeping pill and felt disconnected from the rest of the narrative. Throughout this entire portion of the book, all I kept thinking was...

The only purpose of this long, long.....LONG section seems to be to allow the reader to see Bernard Marx do a complete 180 in his views on the society once he finds himself in the role of celebrity by virtue of his relationship with John the savage. Sorry, this just did not strike me as a big enough payoff for this dry, plodding section. It was a test of endurance to get through this portion of the book, so I'm being generous when I give it a weak 2.0 to 2.5 stars. I could just have easily summed it up by just saying...

Bottom-line, I think this is a book that should be read. It's important book and there is much brilliance here. Plus, it is short enough that the stale boring segments aren't too tortuous to get through. However, as far as the triumvirate of classic dystopian science fiction goes...1984 is still the undisputed champ.3.0 Stars. Recommended.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World
Anthem;Ayn Rand;1938;1930;105;3.61;158380;no;['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Philosophy', 'Science Fiction', 'School', 'Literature'];"Anthem is Ayn Rand's classic tale of a dystopian future of the great ""We""—a world that deprives individuals of a name or independence—that anticipates her later masterpieces, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. They existed only to serve the state. They were conceived in controlled Palaces of Mating. They died in the Home of the Useless. From cradle to grave, the crowd was one—the great WE.In all that was left of humanity, there was only one man who dared to think, seek, and love. He lived in the dark ages of the future. In a loveless world, he dared to love the woman of his choice. In an age that had lost all trace of science and civilization, he had the courage to seek and find knowledge. But these were not the crimes for which he would be hunted. He was marked for death because he had committed the unpardonable sin: He had stood forth from the mindless human herd. He was a man alone. He had rediscovered the lost and holy word—I.""I worship individuals for their highest possibilities as individuals, and I loathe humanity, for its failure to live up to these possibilities."" —Ayn Rand";I cannot believe I just realized now I did not have this book marked as read! I read this back in high school and loved it!For those thinking about trying Ayn Rand, this is a good intro book considering it is only a little over 100 pages and her other popular titles (mainly talking about Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead) are quite daunting in their length.Now, in the past I have had trouble reviewing Ayn Rand because she is controversial. Usually this leads to people not being able to separate a review of a book from a political statement. Since I don't like arguing politics and figure everyone is entitled to their opinion, I will again attempt to avoid putting any sort of political spin on this one - but it may not be completely avoidable.For me, this book is in the same category as 1984 and Brave New World. It is a commentary on where we might be going if we are not careful. In this book, the main issue is loss of self in forced servitude to the larger governmental machine. The writing is creative and riveting enough that it is very easy to finish this in one sitting.Check out Anthem and read it with an open mind (even if it doesn't match your politics) and I think you will find an interesting, enjoyable, and thought provoking classic.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/667.Anthem

Lovecraft;1931;1930;194;3.81;55701;yes;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Lovecraftian'];"Long acknowledged as a master of nightmarish vision, H.P. Lovecraft established the genuineness and dignity of his own pioneering fiction in 1931 with his quintessential work of supernatural horror, At the Mountains of Madness. The deliberately told and increasingly chilling recollection of an Antarctic expedition's uncanny discoveries --and their encounter with an untold menace in the ruins of a lost civilization--is a milestone of macabre literature.This Definitive Edition of At the Mountains of Madness (The Modern Library) also includes Lovecraft's long essay ""Supernatural Horror in Literature.""";"Imagine: Your friend goes to Antarctica with a team of scientists and discovers the remains of a before-the-dawn-of-time alien civilization AND then finds the ripped up bodies of some team members lying around AND then was chased by the lost alien forms.

War with the Newts;Karel Čapek;1936;1930;241;4.17;15131;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Czech Literature', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Humor'];Man discovers a species of giant, intelligent newts and learns to exploit them so successfully that the newts gain skills and arms enough to challenge man's place at the top of the animal kingdom. Along the way, Karel Capek satirizes science, runaway capitalism, fascism, journalism, militarism, even Hollywood.;In his derisively dystopian War with the Newts Karel Čapek, writing about newts, actually satirizes the foolish ways of mankind. Bellicose newts… What creatures are those?There is a small island… And there is a tiny bay… And it is known as Devil Bay…And what do those… devils… look like?’‘Like little children,’ the Singhalese breathed. ‘They’ve got a tail and they are this tall,’ and he indicated about four feet from the ground. ‘They stood all around me and watched what I was doing there… there was a whole ring of them around me…’ The Singhalese began to tremble.However there’s noting fiendish about this beings… They are absolutely harmless and innocent… And they are quite friendly…‘They’re entirely naked, Mr Bondy, like some kind of frog or those salamanders. And those front paws of theirs, they’re just like children’s hands, except that they have only four fingers.

That is where mankind’s future lies.’Giving to the newts knives man taught them to defend themselves against sharks… But one day there comes a moment when the newts have to defend themselves from man…‘Here it says that near the town of Kankesanturai in Ceylon the Newts have raided a village.

Star Maker;Olaf Stapledon;1937;1930;272;3.91;8436;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Philosophy', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Novels'];One moment a man sits on a suburban hill, gazing curiously at the stars. The next, he is whirling through the firmament, and perhaps the most remarkable of all science fiction journeys has begun.Even Stapledon's other great work, LAST AND FIRST MEN, pales in ambition next to STAR MAKER, which presents nothing less than an entire imagined history of life in the universe, encompassing billions of years.;Wow. Just wow. This novel disproves the general assumption that golden age SF is either hokey or unscientific.In fact, it starts out like a strong hard-SF exploration novel touching on many possible alien races, mindsets, and physiologies, but it dives right down the rabbit hole into vast combined telepathic minds, galactic societies that actually are GALACTIC in scale, telepathic communication with multiple galaxies, and even to the discovery the rich stellar intelligence. That's right. Intelligent suns.And an ever further exploration follows. This is a short novel that spans 5 billion years! It may be fast, glorious, imaginative, and deeply philosophical, but more than that, it's SUBVERSIVE.Let me be clear on this. This novel is just as valid and fun today as it must have been back in 1937. More than that, it's probably something that would be appreciated more NOW than way back then.Why? The Star Maker is the creation of God from Man. And even better, it even flies right into Manichean heresies! :) As HARD SF! It's fast as hell and fun as HELL! :)Olaf Stapledon is easily one of the most brilliant and imaginative writers to have ever decided to use hard-SF as a furious vehicle of massive speculative philosophy in sociology, biology, physics, and cosmology. Was he a brilliant man? What do you think?I can't get my jaw to stop dropping. I'm not even giving it special props for coming out of 1937. It's as good as any of the most vast-spanning hard-SF of today. Come blow your mind! :);https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/525304.Star_Maker
Triplanetary;"E.E. ""Doc"" Smith";1934;1930;287;3.65;7161;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Pulp'];From the atomic age in Atlantis to a world remote in space and time, two incredible ancient races, the Arisians and the Eddorians, are in the midst of an interstellar war with Earth as the prize. The Arisians, using advanced mental technology, have foreseen the invasion of their galaxy by the corrupt and evil Eddorians, so they begin a breeding program on every planet in their universe. Their goal...to produce super warriors who can hold off the invading Eddorians.;"I've heard people rave about how Doc Smith's work was one of the early space operas and that it influenced many later science fiction masterpieces. This may be true, but I'm thinking that just because it was influential, doesn't mean I have to like it. And I don't much. It's been pointed out by others that this book hasn't aged well, and maybe that's my problem with it. Then again, the Hardy Boys haven't aged well, and I still (guilty pleasure alert) like some of the series. But I read those as a child, so there's a bit of nostalgia that goes with my reading of the Hardy Boys. Not so with Smith's novel, Triplanetary. I wasn't a child when Doc Smith's first works came out, so I don't have that glittering/blinding cloud of nostalgia around his work, like the one that engulfs me when I read Hardy Boys.Maybe seeing Flash Gordon reruns at about the same time that Star Wars came out back in the '70s caused a rift in my mind, a gaping gulf between ""then"" and ""now"" (or what was ""now"" at the time). Pan Star Wars all you want, but the original movie is both derived from the old Flash Gordon serials and a reworking of the trappings in a beautiful and brilliant ""new"" (again, speaking relatively of time) packaging. I loved it, and still do. Flash Gordon is laughable, and was laughable even when I was a child. And because it's laughable, I kind of enjoy the campiness of it all. But I don't take it as seriously as it takes itself.And maybe that's my problem. Perhaps I went into this book ready to take it seriously, hence I was seriously disappointed. I can't look back on it and glory in the unintentional silliness of it all - the chauvinism, the absolutely terrible dialogue, and the deus ex machina (and here, I mean literally ""machine"") that jerks the plot in unlikely directions and destroys pacing. All of this makes for an agitating read full of overstimulus, like overdosing on cocaine or deciding, against all better judgement, that you should take the plunge off the 3 story tall water slide only to find that it wasn't such a good idea just as your butt clears the drop. Smith's attempts in this vein seem like a way to buy off, rather than reward the reader for patience. And I know not everyone wrote like that back in that day and age, so don't feed me the ""His writing was a product of the time"" line.The one aspect of the book that I did enjoy didn't involve the human characters at all. I actually quite liked the alien race, the Nevians. But the whole mess between Triplanetary (the human alliance) and these amphibian aliens could have been avoided, had someone just stopped for a moment and talked about the abundance of iron resources available in the asteroid belt. Why didn't anyone think of that? Can't we all just get along?!?So I finished the book. I can honestly say that. I won't be reading any more of E.E. ""Doc"" Smith's work, however. I've had enough. Too much, in fact. I can only be force-fed so many unlikely twists and perfect saves before declaring: ""Doc Smith is to hyperbole in science fiction what Monty Hall was to giveaways.""Still, I liked the aliens. At least they made sense. In fact, rather than destroying the galaxy, the aliens are saving a bit of the galaxy by keeping my rating of this book at two stars, rather than one.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444944.Triplanetary
Last and First Men;Olaf Stapledon;1930;1930;246;3.79;6453;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"""No book before or since has ever had such an impact upon my imagination,"" declared Arthur C. Clarke of Last and First Men. This masterpiece of science fiction by British philosopher and writer Olaf Stapledon (1886–1950) is an imaginative, ambitious history of humanity's future that spans billions of years. Together with its follow-up, Star Maker, it is regarded as the standard by which all earlier and later future histories are measured.The protagonist of this compelling novel is humanity itself, stripped down to sheer intelligence. It evolves through the ages: rising to pinnacles of civilization, teetering on the brink of extinction, surviving onslaughts from other planets and a decline in solar energy, and constantly developing new forms, new senses, and new intellectual abilities. From the present to five billion years into the future, this romance of humanity abounds in profound and imaginative thought.";"""Last and First Men"" has been a unique experience. It teaches and entertains, not by presenting the reader with facts, but by serving him and her with a broad range of possibilities that don't only open the eyes but also the mind.On a basic level, the experience was very pleasant because of the imaginative power of Olaf Stapledon. His imagination is second to none. The images he conjures up provided me with the biggest spectacle I've ever seen, and that I can hope to see in the future. A single paragraph sometimes contains more wealth than the complete oeuvres of our most celebrated authors. To an author, this book must read like a succession of story settings, and it's not surprising to see many claim it has been a source of inspiration to their own work. And yet while this book is rightly praised for this abundance of imagination and the mind-blowing proportion of it, this praise falls short of expressing what made ""Last and First Men"" such a magnificent read to me. A love for life seeps from its pages, rooted in common sense but also in the romantic. It's a symphony of reason and emotions, of smallness and vastness, and its conclusion left me enriched, happy and deeply moved.A fear I have while writing this review is that my admiration for it won't do this book any justice, nor any favors. That it will imperfectly shape expectations of anyone reading this review, that it will put so much emphasis on my experience of it so that it doesn't leave room for you, the reader, to form an opinion that completely disregards what might be perceived as the opinion of a wide-eyed fanatic. Or that people not having liked the book will use my possibly emotional arguments against the very thing I hold so dear. But I have to take my chances. I do want to share it, given that at times my heart literally was beating faster while reading, and that my eyes could simply not believe what they were reading. The fact that this book was written/published in 1930, before even World War II happened, adds to the sense of something miraculous having occurred here. I repeatedly double-checked if this 1930 wasn't in reference to something else, a symptom of the lack of belief that characterized my eyes at the time of reading. One of the things I liked aside from the bedazzling scope of the author's imagination is the way the fourth wall was broken through the idea that the author himself was but a vessel of communication between a very distant future human life form and the reader. The account of all the iterations of mankind's evolution and the richness in detail and nuance make it read like a convincing historical account, convincing enough to even entertain the idea proposed by the author that the future speaks to us through these pages.This leads me to react on two criticisms I have read here repeatedly. The first is that the near-future predictions were wrong. While I guess this is true when it comes to certain details, protagonists, scientific discoveries and so on, I think no justice is done to this book by considering it a ""historical account of the future"", a creative exercise in future forecasting. It's more than that. It's more than anything I know, and categorizing it is a mistake. Even science fiction is too narrow a field to contain all that is within this book. In any case, running your finger along its lines and double-checking it with reality is futile and senseless, and completely besides the point. In fact, even in his supposedly wrong predictions of the near future, Stapledon touched on some very true traits of human nature. In my version of the book the foreword by Gregory Benford actually recommends not reading the first chapters because of their factual errors. Please do not follow this man's advice. Don't skip anything in this book, or at least not anything Stapledon has written.A second criticism I read is on the way the ""story"" is presented. There is a lack of a constant character to relate to and the birdseye-view (or Flying Man's view) prevents any bonding between reader and story. I can't but disagree. First of all, the civilisations are presented in a way that is detailed and passionate enough as to allow the reader to feel right at home among them, whether they'd be on Earth, Venus or Neptune. Sometimes (though rarely) Stapledon also zooms in on individuals, providing the reader with yet another way of engaging with the millions of characters that are within this book. And ultimately, I myself couldn't help but feel like a character within it. How's that for immersion? This story tells the story of humanity, so the leap is not that big to make.This book is deeply philosophical. And here we come to the main reason why I don't just like this book, but love it. It asks life's biggest questions without falling into the trap of falling on one's knees and shout out an exasperated ""WHY?!"". Rather, it's written by someone with a tender yet firm, a questioning yet reassuring voice. It's always very collected, dispassionate when exploring possibilities, when describing the search of so many people, the defeats they endure, their disappointments and their small victories. It's an ode to humanity, without forgetting the baseness and evil that sometimes characterizes us. And despite the theme, it doesn't present humankind as the center of the universe, though it does shortly consider the possibility that it is its most beautiful flower. This consideration is blissfully left open without a conclusion. It's an ode to light despite all the darkness that surrounds it. It's an ode to the temporary in an eternal setting. It's an ode to the cosmos despite not knowing what the hell it is. It's telling me that life is ultimately beautiful, despite its insignificance in the vast expanse of time, space and possibilities. That the universe is a wonderful riddle, regardless of whether we can solve it or not. That being able to recognize the mystery that surrounds and pervades us is a gift in itself, a spark that can take humanity a far way. I highly recommend this book to everyone. I won't judge you if you don't like it, I can't offer the guarantee that you will, but I can only say I'm very glad I can count myself among those who really do. I won't claim this book is an easy read. There were days where I didn't feel I had the mental capacity to fully get what was written and move forward. But it's a fulfilling read. Be patient and give yourself the time to find the right moment to read it. I'm surprised this book isn't a worldwide, timeless success, given its scope. There's something in there for everyone and it's surprising to me that it's not part of mass culture, but this surprise makes me all the more grateful that I got the chance to discover it.

Animal Farm;George Orwell;1945;1940;141;3.99;4016626;no;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'School', 'Literature', 'Science Fiction'];Librarian's note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition of this book here.A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.;"سيظل دائما جميع الحيوانات سواسية..الا ان بعض ""الخنازير"" ستري دائما انها ""متساوية"" اكثر من الاخرينجورج اورويل عام 1943 يقدم لنا نموذج لثورةثورة حيوانات علي ""صاحب العزبة""..عشان حقوقهمثورة زي اي ثورة في تاريخ الانسانية..ثورة زي الثورة الروسية ولا الرومانية ولا ....أهي ثورةحكاية مكررة، تقريبا بنفس النهاية..فإننا لم نتعلم من التاريخ، فهل سنتعلم من الرمز؟الحكاية هنا حكاية ثورةثورة ما من اجل عيش يتناسب مع العمل..من اجل حرية حقيقيةثورة ما من اجل الكرامة..ثورة من اجل العدالة الاجتماعيةثورة نجحت في ازالة الضاغية...ثورة نجحت في جعل الارض كلها حقا للثوارصارت ارضهم وملكهم..صار خيرها كله لهم..صاروا يملكون زمام امورهمصاروا يتغنون نشيد نصرهم...فرحين بحريتهم..يرون في المستقبل فقط رخائهمآل التنظيم الي جماعه من الخنازير..يقودها اثنانالاول اختار مصلحة باقي الحيوانات واراد تطوير حياتهم بما يحقق اهداف ثورتهموالثاني اختار الكسل..اختار التراخياختار ان يطلق علي الاول كلابه ليتلاشيواختار ان ينفيه ويعلنه خائنا للبلاد..لاختلاف سياسة الاصلاح التي يريدها الاول بسياستهشوه سمعته ومحا بطولته..بإستخدام خنزير اعلامي ""يقلب الحق باطلا"" ايضا يعمل تحت سياستهاختار ان يغير الدستور الوصايا السبع..بما يحقق مصالحه وسياستهوصار الثاني هو الحاكم الرسمي للبلاد..الحاكم الشرعي..الوحيد ..الجمهوري المنتخب..بما لا يتعارض مع سياستهصار الاول خائن...واي من يظهر عليه علامه تمرد فإنه خائن مثله ويعدم فورا..لا يتعارض هذا مع القانون..فقد غطي عليه بسياستهعاد الظلم..عاد القهر..عاد الفقر وقله العيشعاد التمييز الاجتماعيوكيف له الا يعود وهناك قطيع من الخرفان الاغنام يمأمأون بانجازات الخنازير الواهية..الكاذبةيرددون الافكار المحرفه..يعلون بها صوتهم فوق اي صوت للمعارضهستتأثر بحق بمشهد اجتماع الناس بعد بضع شهور..يتذكرون ما كان ..ويقارونه بالانكيف ضاعت ثورتهم...كيف ضاع حلمهم..وكيف خفت صوت نشيدهميحاولوا التغني بنشيدهم مره اخري ...لربما بعث لهم الامل مجدداليفاجأوا بمنع الخنازير للنشيد..فالثوره انتهت بالنسبه للخنازير بحكمهم..وباعدامهم اخوانهم..المعارضون الخونه*************************ركب الخنازير الثورة وحموا حكمهم بالكلاب الشرسةوغطوا علي اخفاقاتهم وسرقاتهم بخنزيرهم المحنك اعلاميا يحيل الحق باطلا والباطل حقاتعاونوا مع الغراب الذي يدفع بغطاء ديني سماوي الحيوانات دفعا لتقبل معيشتهم الضنكهثم تحالفوا مع عدوهم الاصلي ليحكموا قبضتهم علي الحكموضعوا يدهم في يد الاعداء...حتي صار لافرق بين خنزيرا وانسان************************************لا اعتقد ان هذا ريفيو اساسا لروايه رائعه صاغها برمزيه وبراعه جورج اورويلهذا مجرد تلخيص ردئلقد عرفت الان لماذا لم تكتب احد اصدقائي هنا في الجودريدز ريفيو عن ذلك الروايه -بالرغم من غزاره ريفيوهاتها-..الروايه لا تستحق ريفيو اساساهي تقرأ وتستوعب فحسبولكن لنصارح أنفسنا ... أننا لم نتعظ من التاريخ بشكل مباشر...فكيف ان نتعظ من صورة رمزية له وإن كانت بمنتهي الأتقانفلنحاولربما ننجح يوما في ثورة لا تنتهي بمزرعة الحيواناتمحمد العربيفقط في 24 يونيو 2013""ملحوظه""-----قرأت تلك الرواية قبل احداث 30 يونيو 2013والغريب جدا ان بعد أعادة قراءتي للريفيو أجد أنها تصلح لنفس الحال بعد سنتين..نفس الريفيو الرمزي يصلح لأي وقت...بالضبط كالرواية..وسعدت أني كتبت الريفيو بالرمز مثلهاالعجيب فعلا ان الرواية تصلح لكل العهود السياسية التي أتت علينامصر قبل 25 يناير وبعدهامصر قبل 30 يونيو وبعدهاوبمجرد ان قرئتها..شعرت ان هذه الرواية يجب ان يتم تدريسها بالمدارس..فكل الاجيال تستحق هذا الوعي السياسيالا اني رايت سببا -وان اكاد ان اجزم انه ليس السبب الرئيسي لهذا- ان نهايتها المقبضه لا تتناسب لصغار السنولكن هذه النهاية المقبضة للاسف...واقعية";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170448.Animal_Farm

Lewis's acclaimed Space Trilogy, which also includes Out of the Silent Planet and That Hideous Strength, Perelandra continues the adventures of the extraordinary Dr. Ransom. Pitted against the most destructive of human weaknesses, temptation, the great man must battle evil on a new planet  Perelandra  when it is invaded by a dark force. Will Perelandra succumb to this malevolent being, who strives to create a new world order and who must destroy an old and beautiful civilization to do so? Or will it throw off the yoke of corruption and achieve a spiritual perfection as yet unknown to man? The outcome of Dr. Ransom's mighty struggle alone will determine the fate of this peace-loving planet.;"""James, does the name 'Perelandra' mean anything to you?""""Yes, I believe so. Poetic name for the planet Venus. Inhabited by two analogues of Adam and Eve, living in a state of prelapsarian bliss. All sounds rather pleasant.""""Very good, James.

Earth Abides;George R. Stewart;1949;1940;345;3.95;30392;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Apocalyptic', 'Dystopia', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];A disease of unparalleled destructive force has sprung up almost simultaneously in every corner of the globe, all but destroying the human race. One survivor, strangely immune to the effects of the epidemic, ventures forward to experience a world without man. What he ultimately discovers will prove far more astonishing than anything he'd either dreaded or hoped for.;Bands of cannibal raiders. Hordes of flesh-starved zombies. Radioactive wastelands stalked by vicious mutants.If you're a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction you've encountered all these scenarios, often blended together. You're familiar with the best ways to dispatch the walking dead, why you should keep away from isolated farmhouses with locked cellars and what lies outside the vault/silo. What you most likely haven't encountered is an end-of-the-world vision like the one George R. Stewart spins in Earth Abides - a zombie-less, nuke-less, cannibal-less world that is all the more compelling in its quiet realism. Earth Abides is a gentler, slower story of the end of civilization than most of its peers. The story begins with a virus that wipes out most of humanity in the late 1940s, leaving only a tiny percentage of the population alive. You've seen this setup before (Stephen King's The Stand was inspired by this book), but where Earth Abides goes from here is both fascinating and original.The remaining people clump together where they can, and Isherwood Williams - who survives the plague somehow due his being bitten by a rattlesnake when the disease strikes - joins a group in a now empty San Francisco. There are no rocket scientists, no survivalists, no surgeons in this group. They are ordinary people, with ordinary skills and they don't form a conquering army or create a post-civilisation Dystopia. Hell, they don't even try to restart civilisation, preferring instead to settle into the debris left behind, using tapwater and electricity until the utilities finally fail, eating the near limitless supplies of canned food left in untouched supermarkets and generally avoiding the reality of their situation. In short, they behave as many ordinary people would in such a situation.What eventuates is a slow reprimitivising of human society as knowledge is lost, superstitions reappear and old, hunter-gatherer patterns of life begin to re-emerge. Isherwood, a man of science and reason, rails against this slow slide away from modernity and does his best to both limit the loss of knowledge and educate the children of his community. His desperate struggle against the inertia of his de-skilled community makes for gripping reading.Earth Abides is a masterful work of post-apocalyptic fiction, and it really resonated with me. Where other novels are fuelled by Walking Dead style battles over resources, or mimic The Stand's good-vs-evil paradigm Earth Abides focuses on ordinary people surviving but failing to maintain modern civilisation in the aftermath of societal collapse. In the post-fact era of 2016, where the entirety of human knowledge is a swipe away, yet is usually completely ignored in favour of leisure, emotion and unfounded opinion Stewart's depiction of post-disaster decline feels ever more prescient. In my opinion Earth Abides is a standout champion of its genre, as gripping and memorable as the best of its ilk. Stewart's unique take and striking ending have stuck in my mind longer than a dozen of his book's mutant-and-dystopia competitors.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93269.Earth_Abides
Red Planet;Robert A. Heinlein;1949;1940;256;3.83;10589;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure'];Jim Marlow and his strange-looking Martian friend Willis were allowed to travel only so far. But one day Willis unwittingly tuned into a treacherous plot that threatened all the colonists on Mars, and it set Jim off on a terrfying adventure that could save--or destroy--them all!From the Paperback edition.;This was, hands down, my favorite Heinlein book as a teen. I read it at least 4 or 5 times. I really need to read it again as an adult, but Heinlein ... always an iffy proposition. Though this is one of his early juvie novels, so it's safer than, say, Time Enough for Love.Two teenage boys, part of the human colonies on Mars, are sent away to boarding school in the biggest city on Mars. In between getting into trouble with the new, insanely strict headmaster, they find out about a plot that could endanger both humans and the native Martians. It’s up to these two boys to save their hometown and their Martian friend from the nefarious forces of evil. Heinlein is especially imaginative here, with the unique Martian civilization and the realistic (at least for the time) details about humans trying to survive in the hostile environment of Mars. There's a pretty heavy gun ownership rights theme running through this book that may irk some readers, the sexual roles are straight from the 1950s (Red Planet was written in 1949, so understandable enough), people in authority tend to be corrupt and/or incompetent, and you have to be able to suspend disbelief in light of what we now know about life on Mars. Other than that, it's a rockin' story! But no matter what, I will always adore Willis the Martian with my entire heart and soul. Sing ¿Quién es la Señorita? one more time, Willis!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50843.Red_Planet
Space Cadet;Robert A. Heinlein;1948;1940;224;3.85;9090;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Adventure', 'Speculative Fiction'];This is the seminal novel of a young man's education as a member of an elite, paternalistic non-military organization of leaders dedicated to preserving human civilization, the Solar Patrol, a provocative parallel to Heinlein's famous later novel, Starship Troopers. Only the best and brightest--the strongest and the most courageous--ever manage to become Space Cadets, at the Space Academy. They are in training to be come part of the elite guard of the solar system, accepting missions others fear, taking risks no others dare, and upholding the peace of the solar system for the benefit of all.But before Matt Dodson can earn his rightful place in the ranks, his mettle is to be tested in the most severe and extraordinary ways--ways that change him forever, from the midwestern American boy into a man of the Solar Patrol.;"As Space Cadet by Robert A. Heinlein begins, a candidate for a space program takes a phone out of his bag and calls his father. Modern readers may pass by this communication with little notice, but describing a cell phone in 1948, the year this was first published, was at the time the height of science fiction. The second published of his Scribner’s juvenile works, this very early Heinlein displays his talent for telling a good, hard science fiction story. One cannot read this without noticing a similarity to his later book Starship Troopers and what must have been an influence on Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game. Astute readers will pick up on early traces of his later libertarianism, though with a paternalistic twist. Heinlein also explores issues of idealism, militarism and even (16 years before Farnham's Freehold and the Civil Rights Act) racism. This is good for RAH fans as well as a good read for readers just getting to know Heinlein; a very good example of the charisma of his juvenile novels.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50852.Space_Cadet
Rocket Ship Galileo;Robert A.

But they never imagined they would team up with a nuclear physicist to construct and crew a rocket bound for the moon.And they never expected to gain some powerful enemies in the process.;"Rocket Ship Galileo (Heinlein's Juveniles, #1), Robert A. HeinleinAfter World War II, three teenage boy rocket experimenters are recruited by one boy's uncle, Dr. Cargraves, a renowned physicist who had worked on the Manhattan Project, to refit a conventionally powered surplus ""mail rocket"".

They use a cleared area in a military weapons test range in the desert for their work, despite prying and sabotage attempts by unknown agents.Upon completion of the modifications, they stock the rocket, which they name the Galileo, and take off for the Moon, taking approximately three days to arrive.

Slan;A.E. van Vogt;1940;1940;272;3.68;5554;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Hugo Awards', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction'];In the 1940s, the Golden Age of science fiction flowered in the magazine Astounding. Editor John W. Campbell, Jr., discovered and promoted great new writers such as A.E. van Vogt, whose novel Slan was one of the works of the era.Slan is the story of Jommy Cross, the orphan mutant outcast from a future society prejudiced against mutants, or slans. Throughout the forties and into the fifties, Slan was considered the single most important SF novel, the one great book that everyone had to read. Today it remains a monument to pulp SF adventure, filled with constant action and a cornucopia of ideas.This edition has a new introduction by Kevin J. Anderson.;"How do I properly describe a novel that uses (incorrectly) atomic energy, but also addressing the fact that it was published in 1940?Well, it's been 76 years since it came out, and its and integral part of the Campbellian SF revolution that said that we can have great Science in Science Fiction, but of course our understanding of these things change as we learn more, so I'm perfectly willing to let a lot of that slide. Still. The fact that it's 1940 when it was published, and he was talking about Atomic Energy as a resource and a weapon *is* also rather mind-blowingly cool. :)That's one of the more noteworthy things about this adventure novel that strings up a ton of cool ideas for us to enjoy, being part dystopian future, part aftermath of a huge pogrom against alien ""supermen"" that the ""supermen"" lost, and partly a mirror to ourselves of the fact of insanely stupid prejudice.The plot proceeds very quickly, which is an amazingly cool feature and expectation for this era's SF adventure books, moving at a nice pace for an Oliver Twist beginning all the way to find a macguffin that would save the benighted alien race of Slans, to learn the slightly surprising reveals about the Slan's origins, while putting us firmly in the hands of a few Slan MCs. Telepathy, strength, speed, and intelligence is all enhanced in these individuals.That's no big surprise, of course. Nietzsche's insanely popular across the world in every continent at this time. Superman (comic) just came out. A war has just popped up over the ocean that bears a lot of identification with it. So much of our literature, and especially SF, has truly heroic super men. It's part of our zeitgeist. What's most interesting is how these supermen are the most downtrodden in the novel, despite all their advantages.But wait, you say, hasn't this been done a million times?Well, yeah, but few before this time have done something quite as intelligently as Vogt. He's trying to send a global message and doing it across so many subjects with so much world building... and the point is, he's doing it with such economy of prose. It's a really short novel.The only other novels that I know of that could pull this off only came later.I'm thinking of The Demolished Man and The Stars My Destination, both by Alfred Bester, and probably these are probably the very best Golden Age SF novels that still hold up today.I'm not going to judge this book by today's standards of SF, although it is superior in pacing and plot, if not characterization. It was also a phenomenon for about 15 years after it came out, being considered the best of the best. Popularity doesn't always mean quality, but this does have a lot of quality.Unfortunately, it's also been copied a million times since then, diluting the effect and the enjoyment that we might have in it now.At least we can point to it as one of the major supermen mythos stories with pride, and hopefully it won't be utterly forgotten in time.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/643792.Slan
Fahrenheit 451;Ray Bradbury;1953;1950;194;3.96;2499292;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Classics', 'School', 'Literature', 'Novels'];Sixty years after its original publication, Ray Bradbury’s internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 stands as a classic of world literature set in a bleak, dystopian future. Today its message has grown more relevant than ever before.Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.;"As I write this review, the year is 2012. We do not live in a perfect world; in fact, in many ways we don't even live in a good world. But one thing I believe with all my heart is that we live in a world which, on the whole, is better than it was fifty years ago. Now, I know I'm writing with limited perspective and that progression and development hasn't been the same all over the globe and even the definition of those words can change depending on what part of the world you live in. But here's what I do know: the average world life expectancy is higher, the infant mortality rate is lower, access to education is greater and the amount of countries that hold regular, fair elections has increased.On average, people today are smarter than they were fifty years ago. And I know this is where older generations throw up their hands in indignation and start yelling about how exams were much harder in ""their day"" and they really had to work for it. I am not disputing this, I have no idea if it's true or not. But what is true is that more people today than ever before are going on to further education after high school, the barriers that once stopped the working class from being as smart as society's more privileged members are slowly starting to break down bit by bit. Literacy rates have been on the rise the whole world over:It's true. We have entered the age of computers and electronics, social networking and personal media players... and the world has not ended, the robots haven't taken over and people haven't become so stupid that they feel the need to rage a war against books. And this is the main reason why I think Bradbury's dystopian tale is out of date and ineffective. The author was writing at a time when technology was really starting to get funky, the digital age was still decades away but people were doing all kinds of crazy things like listening to music with little cones plugged into their ears. Bizarre. Readers often choose to view Bradbury's story as one about censorship instead of technology because that allows a more modern reader to connect with the world portrayed. But taken as it was intended, I just don't share the author's sentiments. Not all technology is good, but I'm of the opinion that the good outweighs the bad: medical advancements, entertainment, access to information via the internet... I'm the very opposite of a technophobe because, in my opinion, forward is the way to go. And I'm sure it's because of the age I was born into, but I cannot relate to the apprehension that Bradbury feels when he tells of this true story (note: this is not in the book):""In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451 I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.""I know many still think today that we are becoming a completely unsociable species because of mobile/cell phones, social networking sites, etc. but I have made friends from all over the world thanks to technology. I have talked to people that fifty years ago I would never have known, I have learned about different cultures and ways of life because I have access to most areas of the world through the web. So, no, I'm not scared of this so-called technological threat that is somehow going to turn our brains to mush and create a society where we cannot concentrate long enough to read a book. And here is where I (finally) get on to details of this novel.What I am supposed to believe in here is that - because of technology - humanity has become so stupid that they couldn't concentrate on books. So books were simplified at first for easier understanding, then banned, then burnt. Why? I am okay with the realistic aspect of ""people have short attention spans because of technology so they don't want to read books"", but why burn books? I don't see why this would need to happen and why it would become a criminal offense to have books in your home. This is where I understand why so many people prefer to apply this novel's message to censorship, because it works so much better that way. The argument for the technological side of it is weak - even for the time in question.The best thing about this whole book is the discussion about the phoenix and the comparisons made between the legendary bird and humanity: in the same way that the bird dies in flames only to be reborn again from the ashes, humanity constantly repeats mistakes made throughout history and never seems to learn from them. Secondly, to give credit where it's due, the writing is suitably creepy for a dystopian society and I understand why people who do actually share Bradbury's concerns would be caught up in the novel's atmosphere. But, overall, this wasn't a great dystopian work for me, I didn't agree with the point it was trying to sell me and I don't think it made a very successful case for it. Furthermore, I had some problems with the pacing. The book is split into three parts and the first two are much slower and uneventful than the last one - which seems to explode with a fast sequence of events in a short amount of time and pages. Disappointing.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13079982-fahrenheit-451
Foundation;Isaac Asimov;1951;1950;244;4.17;552408;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera'];The first novel in Isaac Asimov's classic science-fiction masterpiece, the Foundation series For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. But only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future--to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save humankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire--both scientists and scholars--and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.;"Honestly, I don't get why this book/series is so popular. There are some interesting elements to it (for instance, the use of religion as a tool of mass control and the implicit resultant argument that religion is no more than a fraud, ""the opiate of the people,"" after all), but the book gave me little to enjoy or dig into. The forces of the novel are broad, historical, dealing with masses of people; this means that there is little to no room for individual characters here and little to be done by the few characters who do appear. One leader says, in fact, in response to a crisis, the threat of warfare and annihilation, ""I'm going to do nothing. One hundred percent of nothing, and that is the secret of this crisis"" (191). This is a recurring theme. Plus, there are no female characters to speak of. One man's wife makes a brief and apparently unnecessary appearance for a page-long chapter, but that's it. All else is done by and to men.There are a couple of minor things I do like about the book. One is Salvor Hardin's statement that ""violence is the last refuge of the incompetent,"" which I like for its endorsement of nonviolent alternatives. Another is the characters' habit of saying ""Space"" or ""Galaxy"" instead of God when they exclaim or curse.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29579.Foundation
Atlas Shrugged;Ayn Rand;1957;1950;1168;3.69;394156;no;['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Literature', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels'];This is the story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world and did. Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators?Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies, but against those who needed him most, and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world’s motor — and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life — from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy — to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction — to the philosopher who becomes a pirate — to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph — to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad — to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels. You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions.This is a mystery story, not about the murder — and rebirth — of man’s spirit. It is a philosophical revolution, told in the form of an action thriller of violent events, a ruthlessly brilliant plot structure and an irresistible suspense. Do you say this is impossible? Well, that is the first of your premises to check.;"Ayn Rand makes my eyes hurt. She does this, not by the length of her six hundred thousand word diatribe, but rather by the frequency with which she causes me to roll them. Do you want to know what I’ve learned after spending nearly two months reading Ayn Rand’s crap? Here’s a brief rundown, Breakfast of Champions style.Socialists are scary. Socialists are frightening creatures who lurk in corners, waiting to pounce on you. They are unpredictable, they have curvature of the spine, and they often foam at the mouth.This is a socialist: 
Capitalists, on the other hand, are calm and rational beings who never lose their tempers. You can always trust a capitalist. And they are super easy to spot, too—just look for the hummingbirds who sew their clothes for them.This is a capitalist: 
Ayn Rand’s characters come in only two flavors, and which kind you get depends solely on the extent to which they embody her philosophical ideals. The capitalists (the “good guys”) are the moral heroes of the story, the ones who fight back against economic regulation. This regulation is seen as unwanted intervention, the government essentially trespassing on one’s property rights by means of unfair (unfair to the capitalists, I might point out) legislation. The “bad guys” are, of course, represented by the socialists—the ones passing the legislation, although Rand does a good job of throwing anyone else into this category who, while not active participants in passing these laws, may not be totally opposed to them, either.The problem with all of this is the fact that her characters are not at all believable. They are robots who mechanically spew forth her inane drivel or, if they are of the other flavor, behave in a manner so utterly ridiculous as to demonstrate the rationality of the capitalist over the vicious, gun-toting socialist who’s come to rob your house, rape your Ma, and shoot your Pa. Rand is so egregious in the maltreatment of her antithetic characters that it’s almost laughable. Beyond that, the narrative itself is monotonous and repetitive. This is not exactly a beach read.But even if I were to put all of that aside, I still wouldn’t be able to get over the fact that Rand’s argument here is to put an end to social collectivism of every form. That means: no social security, no unemployment insurance, no federally funded health care, no public roads, no public housing, no public education, no income taxes, no property taxes—does this not sound insane?! I get the whole “ooh” and “aah” aspect of libertarian freedoms, but I’m betting there wouldn’t be a lot of volunteers willing to relinquish their adequately funded public services on the basis of a free market economy. And ultimately, this is the fundamental principle on which Rand and I disagree. Although I do believe, and strongly, that the government should have no authority to interfere in the private lives of its citizens, do I think the government should also abstain from interfering in the regulation of the economy? Hellz, no! I want those corporate mother fuckers taxed and if that means Ima start foaming at the mouth, then so be it.Ultimately, this novel is more absurdist fiction than dystopian fiction. Rand takes an all-in-or-all-out approach to problem solving; there can be no moral ambiguity—either you’re with her or you’re not, and I’m not. But what does she care? Rand is an unabashed admirer of the wealthy industrialist and it is for him that she bats her eyes and licks her lips, not for me.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662.Atlas_Shrugged
Starship Troopers;Robert A. Heinlein;1959;1950;264;4.01;231921;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Military Fiction', 'War', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera'];"The historians can’t seem to settle whether to call this one ""The Third Space War"" (or the fourth), or whether ""The First Interstellar War"" fits it better. We just call it “The Bug War."" Everything up to then and still later were ""incidents,"" ""patrols,"" or ""police actions."" However, you are just as dead if you buy the farm in an ""incident"" as you are if you buy it in a declared war...In one of Robert A. Heinlein’s most controversial bestsellers, a recruit of the future goes through the toughest boot camp in the Universe—and into battle with the Terran Mobile Infantry against mankind’s most alarming enemy.";A great work of science fiction.This is not at all about action, and fighting bugs, it is a study of a man’s compulsion to fight and or serve his country, and a discussion about our society’s, and any society’s responsibility to its citizens and what is best for society. Like many Heinlein novels, it works well on many levels, the surface science fiction, and then the deeper, more complicated voice of the storyteller, speaking from his own experience.This is a controversial book. Criticized for espousing a militaristic, maybe fascist ideal, Heinlein was also criticized from the other side for his own lack of combat experience. This book inspires strong emotions. At the end of the day, it was a fine book, another excellent, genre transcending work from Heinlein.*** 2020 reread - Starship Troopers came out in 1959, a departure from his juveniles published by Scribners’. This is more mature and his ideological and social commentary is more advanced.A modern reader will find some somewhat dated action sequences as our heroes fight first alien “skinnies” and then the main antagonist bugs. The most important thing going on between the covers, though, is Heinlein’s description of a society that rose from the ashes of the “noble experiment” of democracy.In Heinlein’s world building, western civilization had collapsed sometime in the late twentieth century after a fight between the Soviet state, the United States and China. What survived was a culture raised up by the veterans of those wars and built on the foundations of military thought and organization. Only a veteran can be a full citizen who can vote and have other rights. There appears to be limits on free speech and due process, and a relaxation of the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Residents are not required to serve, and in ironic twists are even discouraged from enlisting, but they can never be a true citizen of the state without veteran status.Marvel introduced Iron Man in the 1963 edition of Tales of Suspense. The armored suits the mobile infantry wear to battle may have been an inspiration for Stan Lee and associates when they envisioned the Iron Man suit.Good fun and also thought provoking.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17214.Starship_Troopers
Foundation and Empire;Isaac Asimov;1952;1950;256;4.22;209665;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Classics'];Foundation and Empire tells the incredible story of a new breed of man who create a new force for galactic government. Thus, the Foundation hurtles into conflict with the decadent, decrepit First Empire. In this struggle for power amid the chaos of the stars, man stands at the threshold of a new, enlightened life which could easily be put aside for the old forces of barbarism. The Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov constitute what is very likely the most famed epic in all of science-fiction;Less episodic than the first (Foundation), which was a plus. But it makes all the more apparent Asimov's complete inability to create memorable or sympathetic characters. This means that each of the two halves read like over-long short stories. Part I is a suspense-thriller, solved by a ridiculous and anti-climactic deus ex machina, while Part II telegraphs its twist-ending so far in advance that the last few chapters are simply redundant. There's no arguing the brilliance of Asimov's ideas -- on science, politics, economics, war, etc. -- all of which come into play in these stories. But his writing itself borders on horrendous. Dialogue is unrealistic and the lovers' language in Part II was particularly stilted and corny, although this could have just been a product of being written in the 50s. Transitions are nonexistent, making some of the scene-jumps confusing at best. A simple empty line would have helped a lot to show the change of scenery (perhaps a problem only of the old edition that I read). Last, the aforementioned characters are poorly developed. It's one thing for Asimov to utilize his normal style of enigma/suspense followed by solution/resolution. This style works well for short stories even if they get monotonous after a while. But when stretched over 100 pages and combined with characters you don't care about, it makes for not much more than a mildly challenging brain teaser: interesting to be sure, but ultimately rather unfulfilling.All this would normally combine for two-star status, but I grant it a third in deference to Asimov's genius and the sheer scope of the enterprise he created with this series. He was clearly an idea man, worrying much less or not at all about the literary aspect of his works. I can respect that, even if it doesn't make for a very satisfying novel.Cross-posted at Not Bad Movie and Book Reviews.@pointblaek;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29581.Foundation_and_Empire

But there was a hidden Second Foundation to protect the first. The Mule has yet to find it, but he was getting closer all the time. The men of the Foundation sought it, too, to escape from Mule's mind control. Only Arkady, a 14 year-old girl seemed to have the answer, or did she...?;(Book 527 from 1001 books) - Second Foundation (Foundation, #3), Isaac AsimovSecond Foundation is the third novel published of the Foundation Series by American writer Isaac Asimov, and the fifth in the in-universe chronology. It was first published in 1953 by Gnome Press.Channis reveals his suspicions about the Second Foundation being located on the planet Tazenda, and takes the ship there. They first land on Rossem, a barren planet controlled by Tazenda, and meet with its governor, who appears ordinary. Once they return to the ship, Pritcher confronts Channis and believes him to have been too successful with the search. The Mule, who had placed a hyper-relay on their ship in order to trace them through hyper-space, appears, and reveals that Channis is a Second Foundationer. Pritcher's emotional bonds to the Mule are broken in the ensuing exchange between Channis and the Mule, and is made to fall into deep sleep. With only the two of them left, the Mule reveals that he has brought his ships to Tazenda and has already destroyed the planet, and yet senses that Channis's dismay is only pretense. He forces Channis to reveal that Rossem is actually the Second Foundation, and that Tazenda is only a figurehead. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و پنجم ماه دسامبر سال1994میلادیعنوان: سقوط امپراطوری کهکشانها (بنیاد دوم)؛ نوشته: آیزاک آسیموف؛ مترجم: حسن اصغری؛ تهران، شقایق، سال1371؛ در358ص موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان روس تبار ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده ی20معنوان: بنیاد دوم کتاب سوم از سری سه گانه بنیاد؛ نویسنده: آیزاک آسیموف؛ مترجم حسین شهرابی؛ تهران، تندیس، سال1399؛ در327ص؛ شابک9786001826542؛ از شاهکارهای علمی تخیلی؛سری «بنیاد» عنوان یک سری هفت جلدی از «آیزاک آسیموف» است، که نامدارترین سری علمی-تخیلی خوانده شده ‌است؛ داستان این سری به ترتیب زمان انتشار پیش نمی‌رود، بلکه «آسیموف» نخست جلدهای سوم (بنیاد)، جلد چهارم (بنیاد و امپراطوری) و جلد پنجم (بنیاد دوم) را نوشتند؛ و سپس با دیر کردی دراز مدت، بنا بر خواسته ی خوانشگران خویش جلد ششم (لبه بنیاد) و جلد هفتم (بنیاد و زمین) را، به آنها افزودند؛ پس از آن با دیر کردی باز هم طولانی، جلد نخست از این سری (سرآغاز بنیاد)، و در پایان نیز اندکی پیش از درگذشتشان جلد دوم (پیشبرد بنیاد) را نگاشتند؛ ترتیب نگارش این داستان‌ها جدا و دیگرگونه از خط داستانی آن‌هاست؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 31/01/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ 18/11/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29580.Second_Foundation
Childhood’s End;Arthur C. Clarke;1953;1950;224;4.12;162806;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Dystopia', 'Aliens'];The Overlords appeared suddenly over every city—intellectually, technologically, and militarily superior to humankind. Benevolent, they made few demands: unify earth, eliminate poverty, and end war. With little rebellion, humankind agreed, and a golden age began. But at what cost? With the advent of peace, man ceases to strive for creative greatness, and a malaise settles over the human race. To those who resist, it becomes evident that the Overlords have an agenda of their own. As civilization approaches the crossroads, will the Overlords spell the end for humankind . . . or the beginning?;Kurt Vonnegut said of Arthur C. Clarke’s novel Childhood’s End that it is one of the few masterpieces in the science fiction genre. Vonnegut went on to say that he, Vonnegut, had written all the others. As humorous as that is, at least the first clause of that declaration I feel to be true. Written simply but with conviction and persuasion, with an almost fable-like narrative quality, Clarke has given to us that rarest of literary achievements: a science fiction masterpiece. The genius of Clarke’s achievement is compounded by the fact that his accomplishment remains so unique, how have later artists failed to match or even make an attempt at duplication? I especially liked the racial memory (or racial premonition) ideas and the ideas of collective consciousness. Interestingly, Clarke’s concepts could be seen as having a theological transcendent theme, perhaps even an allegory for awakening to a collective ego. Clarke’s ingenuity remains untouched and this work stands atop the science fiction canon, comparable to only a handful of other science fiction classics, including the novel that won the Hugo Award in 1954, the same year Childhood’s End was nominated for that award, Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451.2023 reread - During this reading I considered the political and social climate of the time when this had been written and first published. World War II had ended, but the Korean War was beginning and there was still much global fear and anxiety and the full extent of totalitarian atrocities was still being grasped and understood. When a reader examines Clarke’s great work but also similarities with other books written during the same period - 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 - we can see the dehumanizing themes prevalent in all of these works.While this is a thought provoking book, full of science fiction themes but also philosophical musings about the meaning and the purpose of life, this time I also considered this as a political allegory, especially regarding collectivism and the role of the individual - and again noting comparisons with other works during this time.Finally I am again reminded of how important this work is in the genre but also as a landmark in our literary history. The layers of religious and philosophical allusion and reference were impressive.On a very short list of greatest science fiction stories of all time.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/414999.Childhood_s_End
The Sirens of Titan;Kurt Vonnegut Jr.;1959;1950;224;4.15;145406;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'Fantasy', 'Literature', 'Novels'];The Sirens of Titan is an outrageous romp through space, time, and morality. The richest, most depraved man on Earth, Malachi Constant, is offered a chance to take a space journey to distant worlds with a beautiful woman at his side. Of course there's a catch to the invitation—and a prophetic vision about the purpose of human life that only Vonnegut has the courage to tell.;Somebody up there likes me. One of my favorite film directors is Wes Anderson. I’m not sure if he is a fan of Kurt Vonnegut, but he should be and he should produce and direct the film adaption of Kurt Vonnegut’s novel, Sirens of Titan. Sirens of Titan, Vonnegut’s second published novel, was released in 1959. Some aspects of his brilliant short story Harrison Bergeron, which was published in 1961, are revealed in the pages of Sirens. Other aspects of this novel are fairly representative of the later work that many people regard as his masterpiece, Slaughterhouse-Five. In fact, interestingly, aspects of several works in Vonnegut’s bibliography can be detected, including Galápagosand Slapstick or Lonesome No More!.Player Piano may have been the first book published by Kurt Vonnegut, but Sirens of Titan was the first Vonnegut book.Player Piano was an excellent story, a fine work of science fiction literature written by a man with much world experience and wisdom. But … for the body of work that would come, that great canon of literature that would inspire and entertain and provoke thought from generations of readers, the vanguard was Sirens of Titan. Kurt Vonnegut, when he wrote Sirens of Titan, was 37 Earth years old, he was 6 feet 2 inches tall and had curly brown hair that his mother, Edith Lieber, called chestnut.I have read a lot of Kurt Vonnegut’s books and I think Sirens of Titan was the book that formed the template, the engineering blueprint, for what would become.And so it goes.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4982.The_Sirens_of_Titan
I Am Legend;Richard Matheson;1954;1950;162;4.06;136744;no;['Horror', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Vampires', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia'];Robert Neville is the last living man on Earth... but he is not alone. Every other man, woman and child on the planet has become a vampire, and they are hungry for Neville's blood.By day he is the hunter, stalking the undead through the ruins of civilisation. By night, he barricades himself in his home and prays for the dawn.How long can one man survive like this?;Absolutely disturbing modern classic! Robert Nevile is the last human in town, maybe on earth. All others are infected and turned into vampires. You read how more and more got infected, how they were buried (this will give you nightmares). There was a pandemic (seems familiar in times like ours at the moment). Ben Cortman, colleague and neighbour who reminds him on Oliver Hardy (the comedian) shouts every evening he should come out. But Robert doesn't want to turn into one of them. He does research on the bacterium that transforms humans into vampires. He takes care of a dog. At some time a woman who calls herself Ruth, enters his dreadful life. Is she infected? At the end you'll come to know who says 'I am Legend' and what's the meaning behind. This is a fantastic, extremely well written book with a very serious message. I can highly recommend reading it. Great plot, great prose, compelling and several movie adaptions!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40940649-i-am-legend
A Canticle for Leibowitz;Walter M. Miller Jr.;1959;1950;334;3.98;111706;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];In a nightmarish ruined world slowly awakening to the light after sleeping in darkness, the infant rediscoveries of science are secretly nourished by cloistered monks dedicated to the study and preservation of the relics and writings of the blessed Saint Isaac Leibowitz. From here the story spans centuries of ignorance, violence, and barbarism, viewing through a sharp, satirical eye the relentless progression of a human race damned by its inherent humanness to recelebrate its grand foibles and repeat its grievous mistakes.;I'm not a Christian, but I live in a Christian society, and it's all around me. Reviewing on Goodreads brings home how many authors can be classified as some kind of Christian apologist. I have very different reactions to them. At one end, I can't stand most of C.S. Lewis - I feel he's there with his foot in the door trying to sell me something, and I'm just hoping that I can get him to take his foot away without being openly rude. At the opposite end, I think Dante is a genius, and that The Divine Comedy is one of the greatest books ever written.A Canticle for Leibowitz is towards the positive end of this spectrum. It's a post World War III novel, where most of the US is a radioactive wasteland, and civilization has more or less collapsed. The only people who still keep any of the lost heritage of the past are a few scattered monasteries. The book tracks the history of one of these monasteries over the course of several hundred years. It's low-key, moving, and often surprisingly funny. Everything is informed by the simple, unquestioning faith shown by the monks. They don't know why they're doing what they are doing, other than that it must be God's will. The author shows you the ridiculous aspects of the story - I particularly liked the illuminated parchments of circuit diagrams decorated with vines and cherubim. And yet he is totally on the monks' side, and after a while the reader is as well. They're doing something important, even though they don't know what it is, and it makes their lives deep and meaningful. Even when they die horrible deaths (several of them do), they do it with dignity, knowing that it's the price that needs to be paid. If Christianity were always like this, I guess I'd be a Christian too. It's a lovely book, that will leave you feeling better about people.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164154.A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz
The Day of the Triffids;John Wyndham;1951;1950;228;4.01;109962;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Horror', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy'];This book is fantastic and frightening, but entirely plausible. It doesn't just seem scientifically possible, but its characters are living people shaken out of the civilization they know into the horror of a world dominated by triffids. The triffids are grotesque and dangerous plants, over seven feet tall, originally cultivated for their yield of high-grade oil. So long as conditions give the mastery to their human directors, they are a valuable asset to mankind. But when a sudden universal disaster turns those conditions upside down, then the triffids, seizing their opportunity, become an active and dreadful menace.The story of what happens is told here by one of the few people lucky enough to escape the disaster.;"Some books can be quite ill-served by their title. 'Not enough triffids!' would complain those lured to this book by the promise of a fun sci-fi romp centered around carnivorous sentient plants - just to find something entirely different.But you gotta agree - a more appropriate title for this unexpected gem of a book such as 
""How complete disintegration of society and civilization as we know it, the sudden helplessness and the painful realization how little it takes to throw us off our tenuous perch on the top of the food chain leads to uncomfortable ethical questions about societal structures and conventions and the implications of successful survival in a forever changed world where our morals and ideas and what we think constitutes humanity may become quite obsolete""
 - well, it doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?This book is really about survival in the midst of disintegrating society and all the implications of it that go against the frequent and quite stereotypical portrayal of such happenings. It's not an optimistic ode to the courageous and morally sound few who carry the torch of civilization into the future while dodging death, slaying monsters and coming unscathed out of numerous death traps, proving again and again that humanity triumphs over all obstacles. No, it's more somberly bleak than that.In Wyndham's story, it did not take much to unravel our society. All it took was a case of worldwide blindness after a breathtakingly beautiful meteor shower that left the vast majority of humans blind, and in the resulting confusion and struggle present-day civilization found its end. Add to it a plague-like outbreak that followed, and finally the titular triffids (semi-sentient mobile carnivorous plants carelessly bioengineered by humans back when our supremacy was a given) - and the survivors of the disaster have their hands full when they try to survive and rebuild some kind of organized new world. 
""Standing there, and at that time, my heart still resisted what my head was telling me. Even yet I had the feeling that it was all something too big, too unnatural really to happen. Yet I knew that it was by no means the first time that it had happened. The corpses of other great cities are lying buried in deserts, and obliterated by the jungles of Asia. Some of them fell so long ago that even their names have gone with them. But to those who lived there their dissolution can have seemed no more probable or possible than the necrosis of a great modern city seemed to me...It must be, I thought, one of the race's most persistent and comforting hallucinations to trust that 'it can't happen here' - that one's own little time and place is beyond cataclysms. And now it was happening here. Unless there should be some miracle I was looking on the beginning of the end of London - and very likely, it seemed, there were other men, not unlike me, who were looking on the beginning of the end of New York, Paris, San Francisco, Buenos Aires, Bombay, and all the rest of the cities that were destined to go the way of those others under the jungle.""
The questions that must be faced once the end of the world as we know it arrives are not heroic (How do we triumph over the monsters?) but quite prosaically practical and yet staggering in their implications: How do we go on as a society - and is there even a place for society as we know it? What do we preserve? What do we have to discard? How do we deal with realizing our own weakness and fragility as a species? Is there a place for the old values and ideas of good and evil, of morals, of responsibility - or does the changed society make us necessarily evolve with it? How much can we move on in the world that has moved on? And the titular triffids lurk just around the corner, hiding in the background until you expect them the least, presenting a slow but steady threat to any attempts to regroup and rebuild, rising up the suddenly vacated niche of the top predators as humans are busy surviving - but they are not the only monsters around.The real challenge to the survival of humans are, of course, other humans. As they come to grips with what happened, every group of survivors - seeing and blind alike - all have their own ideas where this new world should be heading to. Conventional morals and usual laws collapse with the society that created them. That's where Wyndham in a very detached, frequently deceptively neutral and sometimes even deadpan delivers the examples of various conventional and not-so-conventional societal set-ups (none of them even remotely ideal) which all challenge ethical principles and societal conventions in so many different ways - and the trouble is, some of them may be necessary in this forever changed world.Of course, written in 1951, this book is very much the product of its time. The eventual threat of the triffids originated, as one would expect in the Cold War society, from the unexplainable and mysterious depths of the enemy Russia. The attitudes of characters are frequently quite paternalistic, especially when any woman is concerned. The attitudes towards disability are very appropriate for that time - and, needless to say, not for our day and age. And yet despite the dated attitudes there is a time-transcending quality to Wyndham's storytelling and its purpose, and that's what makes this book survive to the present day as a classic that does not stop being relevant, that still makes you think critically about humanity and society and question things that we are so used to taking for granted, and that treats humanity despite all of our clear flaws and arrogance as something that deserves to survive and persevere.

The Caves of Steel;Isaac Asimov;1953;1950;206;4.19;103346;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Classics', 'Robots', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];"A millennium into the future two advancements have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain. Isaac Asimov's Robot novels chronicle the unlikely partnership between a New York City detective and a humanoid robot who must learn to work together. Like most people left behind on an over-populated Earth, New York City police detective Elijah Baley had little love for either the arrogant Spacers or their robotic companions. But when a prominent Spacer is murdered under mysterious circumstances, Baley is ordered to the Outer Worlds to help track down the killer. The relationship between Life and his Spacer superiors, who distrusted all Earthmen, was strained from the start. Then he learned that they had assigned him a partner: R. Daneel Olivaw. Worst of all was that the ""R"" stood for robot--and his positronic partner was made in the image and likeness of the murder victim!";"The Caves of Steel (Robot #1), Isaac AsimovThe book was first published as a serial in Galaxy magazine, from October to December 1953. A Doubleday hardcover followed in 1954.The Caves of Steel is a novel by American writer Isaac Asimov. It is essentially a detective story, and illustrates an idea Asimov advocated, that science fiction can be applied to any literary genre, rather than just a limited genre. In this novel, Isaac Asimov introduces Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw, later his favorite protagonists. They live roughly three millennia in Earth's future, a time when hyperspace travel has been discovered, and a few worlds relatively close to Earth have been colonized—fifty planets known as the ""Spacer worlds"". The Spacer worlds are rich, have low population density (average population of one hundred million each), and use robot labor heavily. Meanwhile, Earth is overpopulated (with a total population of eight billion, and strict rules against robots have been passed. The ""Caves of Steel"" are vast city complexes covered by huge metal domes, capable of supporting tens of millions. In The Caves of Steel and its sequels (the first of which is The Naked Sun), Asimov paints a grim situation of an Earth dealing with an extremely large population, and of luxury-seeking Spacers who limit birth to permit great wealth and privacy. Asimov, who described himself as a claustrophile, mentioned that a reader asked him how he could have imagined such an existence with no sunlight, and related that it had not struck him until then that living perpetually indoors might be construed as unpleasant. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه سپتامبر سال 1991میلادیعنوان: غارهای پولادی؛ نویسنده: آیزاک آسیموف؛ مترجم: شهریار بهترین؛ تهران، آواره، 1363، در 398ص؛ داستانهای علمی تخیلی از نویسندگان روس تبار ایالات متحده آمریکا؛ سده ی 20مماجراهای داستان در آینده‌ ای بسیار دور رخ می‌دهد؛ در آینده‌ ای خیالی، ساختار جامعه‌ ی زمین، فرهنگ و شرایط زندگی مردم، بسیار متفاوت از زندگی امروزین است.؛ در دنیای آینده‌ ی غارهای پولادی، مردمان زمین، در شهرهای سرپوشیده‌ ای زندگی می‌کنند، که آن را غارهای پولادی می‌نامند.؛ مدت‌ها پیش از زمان داستان، عده‌ ای از مردمان زمین به فضا مهاجرت کرده، و پنجاه کره را، در فضا مسکونی کرده‌ اند.؛ مهاجران با دستکاری ژنتیکی خود، و دستکاری محیط زیستشان، طول عمر خود را نیز افزایش داده، و در واقع تبدیل به ابرانسان‌هایی شده‌ اند، که نیاکان خود در زمین را، خرد و کوچک می‌شمارند.؛ شخصیتهای محوری داستان کارآگاهی به نام: «الیاس بیلی»، و روباتی به نام «آر-دنیل الیواو» هستند؛ زمین در سالی نامعلوم، حول و حوش 2600میلادی تا 3000میلادی است، که از سوی نویسنده، به درستی مشخص نمیشودتعداد انسانهای زمینی، به مرز هشت میلیارد نفر رسیده، و به همین دلیل با کمبود شدید منابع روبروست.؛ کشاورزی نوینی که حاصل شیمی آلی پیشرفته آن روزگاران است، ابداع شده، و غذای همه ی آدمیان را، از مخمرها درست میکنند.؛ کشوری با مرزبندی کنونی، ظاهرا وجود ندارد، و تنها شهرهای خودمختار وجود دارند، که همه جای زمین یکسان اداره میشوند.؛ انسانها داخل ابرشهرهای سرپوشیده، و با مقررات ویژه زندگی میکنند.؛ خانه های آنها، آشپزخانه، و حمام، و دستشویی ندارد، و همه در غذاخوریهای عمومی غذا میخورند، و در پرسونالهای عمومی حمام میکنند، و به دستشوییهای عمومی میروند.؛ پول جایگاهی ندارد، و هر کس بنا به کاری که انجام میدهد، دارای جایگاهی است.؛ پس اگر بهتر کار کنند، و در کارشان پیشرفت کنند، میتوانند امتیازهایی بدست آورند، تا بدانجا که برخی در خانه، اجازه ی تناول وعده هایی از غذای خویش را دارند، و اجازه ی داشتن آشپزخانه کوچکی، و در موارد دیگر، حتی دستشویی دارندبالاتریها، و سرشناسترها، میتوانند همسران و دخترانشان را، به مکانهایی که در طبقات بالا قرار دارد، بفرستند، تا حمام آفتاب بگیرند، و البته این مکانها هم با شیشه های ضخیم از محیط خارج جدا شده اند.؛ انسان با زمین بیگانه شده، و هوای آزاد را مسموم میداند.؛ طلوع و غروب آفتاب را نمیشناسد، و باران را ندیده است.؛ در غارهای خودساخته و بسته زندگی میکند، و ارتباطی با محیط بیرون ندارد.؛ انسان زمینی در گذشته های دور، پنجاه مستعمره ی دیگر، در فضا ایجاد کرده، که اکنون مستعمره نشینان از لحاظ فناوری، همانند اروپای امروز در برابر آسیا هستند.؛ آنها کم جمعیت و ثروتمندند، و عمر طولانی دارند.؛ چند سالی هست که (بنا به دلایلی که با خواندن داستان مشخص میشود) به زمین آمده اند، اما از زمینیان دوری میکنند، و در کنار شهر آنها، شهرکی برپا کرده اند، که روباز است، و آفتاب به آن میتابد و باران میبارد.؛ در داستان، روباتها کم کم به زندگی زمینیان وارد میشوند، و به جای انسان قرار میگیرند.؛ اهالی زمین این را کار فضاییها میدانند، و شورشهایی را علیه آنها برپا کرده اند.؛ داستان از جایی آغاز میشود، که در شهرک فضاییها قتلی رخ داده، و کاراگاه «الیاس بیلی»، مامور بررسی پرونده میشود.؛ از سوی فضاییها هم، روباتی کاملا شبیه انسان، به نام «آر-دنیل الیواو»، به عنوان همکار کاراگاه گسیل میشود.؛ ...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 28/08/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 09/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41811.The_Caves_of_Steel

Player Piano;Kurt Vonnegut Jr.;1952;1950;341;3.9;58039;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Humor'];Kurt Vonnegut’s first novel spins the chilling tale of engineer Paul Proteus, who must find a way to live in a world dominated by a supercomputer and run completely by machines. Paul’s rebellion is vintage Vonnegut—wildly funny, deadly serious, and terrifyingly close to reality.Alternate cover edition here;Man created machines in his own image... And man and machine alike were told to worship one deity: the CORPORATE PERSONALITY! The 10 Commandments according to the Church Of Corporate Thinking:1. Thou shalt believe in one corporation2. Thou shalt have no other corporations beside the one you serve3. Thou shalt honour all traditions and communal behaviours of your corporation4. Thou shalt accept whatever the corporation tells you as truth5. Thou shalt have no other truths except for corporate truth6. Thou shalt lie, steal and kill to protect your corporation against enemies7. Thou shalt not think outside the profitability and efficiency box8. Thou shalt not covet any social change but the one that is good for the corporation9. Thou shalt believe in the infallibility of the machines10. Thou shalt not demand meaning in life, but entertainment and convenienceThis is Vonnegut’s first novel, and the fifth I am reading. I have seen many reviews reflecting that his dark sarcasm is not fully developed yet, and that this is one of his weaker works linguistically as well. That may be. But it broke my heart. I am stunned, speechless, overwhelmed. It felt similar to reading Virginia Woolf’s The Voyage Out after finishing her later novels. It is all there in the making, even though the narrative style still remains more “conventional” than in later experimental stages. Just like her first novel was full of the anxiety of a world on a disastrous voyage towards the Great War, Vonnegut’s first novel shows the horrible making of the post-modern human being - more robotic than the computers that are about to be invented. It is an act of rationalization that does not end until human life itself has become redundant in the world of technological perfection. Vonnegut, however, does not criticize technology or the development of science per se. His aim is to show the robotic majority of humankind's need to form exclusive groups with certain patterns, protected against the outside world through specific procedures of selection. To keep unity within the group, external enemies and propaganda are utilized effectively. Vonnegut’s narrative mirrors Camus’ reflections on societies and rebellions in L'homme révolté, a pendulum movement between different corporations, eternally building new oppressive systems to support ideas that are taken for absolute truth, and weighed against other ideas, considered evil and thus to be destroyed with moral impunity.  As a hilarious contrast foil, and tribute to Montesquieu’s Lettres Persanes, where a Persian explains the function of the pope from the perspective of an outsider (“C'est une vielle idole qu'on encense par habitude”), the story is accompanied by sequences describing the travelling Sha of Bratpuhr, who carefully studies different aspects of society and insists on calling the robot-like Americans “Takaru”, meaning “slaves”. The annoyed interpreter deliberately mis-translates the Shah’s recurring exclamation “Takaru, Takaru” into “citizens”, thus showing the true colours of citizenship in a state of prescribed behaviour and commitment.The overarching topic of the uselessness of modern human beings, as explored on a deeper level in God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, receives no definite solution, as the pendulum between power and rebellion keeps moving.I felt a shiver down my spine reading about corporate team-building: a camp for brainwashing highly intelligent people. It reminded me of some education conferences, where pedagogues are given formulas for teaching “critical thinking skills”, along with lesson plans, standardized assessments and documentation for the all-important accreditation processes of popular curriculum brands. Bilious competitiveness within the organisation is lauded, as long as it follows prescribed rules, while search for personal freedom and creativity is punished, severely. Surveillance of every single step in a human’s life is taken for granted, and technology is embraced as the perfect spy on your private life and thoughts. Living in one of the most automatized countries in the world, I smiled at the primitive control functions in Vonnegut’s dystopian visions for the future. But it was a frozen smile, and it hurt.Helpless, powerless, quixotic, main character Proteus goes from one collective organisation to the next: socialized to be one in a group, he has few weapons, and the message seems to be that as an individual, you are prey, alone, hiding in a world of brutal predators who justify their evil with the commandments of their corporation. Part of the organisation, they have no personal responsibility, and hence feel no guilt.Nomen est omen.Proteus’ name is indicating versatility, adaptability and flexibility, and he struggles to live up to the rigidity and immutability that is required in order to survive in a competitive group with a shared visionary dogma. His opponent, Shepherd, embraces the dogma and is thus perfectly suited to care for sheep.When Eve ate the apple, she was the first one to break the rules of the corporation of the Garden Eden. She was expelled for it, and that is how the story goes, ever since: think for yourself, make your own decisions, speak up against illogical or inhumane rules and actions, and you are OUT! And human! Not a takaru or citizen! Congratulations! Let’s fight the windmills of the corporate personality, for some magic to stay in the world.For as long as we are here, our stories will go on, as Vonnegut brilliantly states in his closing lines:“This isn’t the end, you know”, he said. “Nothing ever is, nothing ever will be - not even Judgment Day.”;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9597.Player_Piano
The End of Eternity;Isaac Asimov;1955;1950;192;4.24;57727;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Fantasy'];Andrew Harlan is an Eternal, a man whose job it is to range through past and present Centuries, monitoring and, where necessary, altering Time's myriad cause-and-effect relationships. But when Harlan meets and falls for a non-Eternal woman, he seeks to use the awesome powers and techniques of the Eternals to twist time for his own purposes, so that he and his love can survive together.;"I've always felt that Isaac Asimov writes brilliant science fiction with boring characters. I love a good time travel story, mostly to see what this author's take on the usual time travel paradoxes will be. Anyone who writes about agents changing history has to explain how they deal with things like the Grandfather Paradox, meeting earlier or later versions of yourself, and so on. There are a handful of well-known ways to deal with these issues (alternate timelines, a deterministic universe, special laws of temporal physics, etc.) and Asimov is rather inventive in using several of them at once.Although The End of Eternity is brilliant in its construction of a civilization of time travelers and all the history and technology that goes into their society and the way they meddle with time, his protagonists are basically a bunch of whiny geeks who've never kissed a girl and act like highly-educated chimpanzees fighting for the highest branch in the treehouse. Asimov's vision of a civilization that spans millions of years and thousands of realities doesn't include a single one where women become scientists and engineers and might join the Eternals' boys' club. The entire plot hinges on not one but two high-ranking Eternals who decide they are willing to throw all of reality into danger for the chance to get laid. I know Asimov was a nerd and he wrote this in the 1950s, but he still could have done better. It's like the idea of women as anything but sex objects to be coveted or to seduce men off the path of Righteous Scientific Objectivity just never occurred to him. So naturally when a girl shows up (the only female character in the entire book), she must spell T-R-O-U-B-L-E, and in this case, the end of Eternity.I enjoyed the story, but Asimov has never been my favorite among the Grand Old Masters of science fiction; there is something just a little too cold and calculating in all of his stories.

The Chrysalids;John Wyndham;1955;1950;200;3.93;57595;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Young Adult'];A world paralysed by genetic mutationJohn Wyndham takes the reader into the anguished heart of a community where the chances of breeding true are less than fifty per cent and where deviations are rooted out and destroyed as offences and abominations.;Imagine a world where a little deviation from the norm in physical appearance means burning and banishment because you are far from what God created. Why there are imperfections when we know perfect exists? God creates perfect humans, plants, and animals, so no deviations have the right to live in the world. They're the work of Devil. A world where people have to give away their loved ones because God has not made them perfect. These deviations or imperfections are known as offenses and blasphemies. Plants, animals fell in to first category while the humans found themselves in the latter. David is born into this world with the power of telepathy. No one is able to detect this and thus he managed to survive in this cruel world. First he was happy that his mutation did not affect his appearance but as he grew, he understood the repercussion of getting caught. Then things took a turn for worse and he along with two others embarks on journey to the distant land. It is easy to imagine how this apoplectic setting could have created controversies at the time of its release because after all only a decade earlier the world had suffered World War II, and the horrors were still fresh. But what appalled me most is that even after five decades nothing has changed and people are still trying to overpower each other, still committing heinous crime against each other in the name of religion and superiority. Definitely one of the better Dystopia that I have read. Highly recommended.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/826845.The_Chrysalids
The Stars My Destination;Alfred Bester;1956;1950;258;4.06;52352;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Cyberpunk', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera'];"In this pulse-quickening novel, Alfred Bester imagines a future in which people ""jaunte"" a thousand miles with a single thought, where the rich barricade themselves in labyrinths and protect themselves with radioactive hitmen—and where an inarticulate outcast is the most valuable and dangerous man alive. The Stars My Destination is a classic of technological prophecy and timeless narrative enchantment by an acknowledged master of science fiction.";"This is my favorite classic science fiction novel. It is rich in incident, ambitious in conception, terse and unemotional in style, and fiercely Romantic in theme. Although it is a revenge tale based on The Count of Monte Cristo, its heart is perhaps closer to Frankenstein, but to a Frankenstein in which the monster is capable of self-redemption, of moving beyond isolation and bitterness toward an enlightened humanity. And all the things that are good about this novel are embodied in its hero—Caliban and Hamlet, Satan and Samson, Cain and Prometheus combined—the brute-genius Gully Foyle.During a war between the Inner and the Outer Planets, Gully Foyle—unlettered, unskilled, amoral—is adrift upon the wreck of the space ship The Nomad, the sole survivor of an attack. When the friendly ship Vorga knowingly passes him by, he becomes consumed by the desire for revenge. It is this passion which motivates him throughout a series of crimes—including (but not limited to) blackmail, rape, and murder--as he transforms himself into the elegant Geoffrey Fourmyle, still searching for the person who years ago decided to leave poor Gully Foyle for dead.Foyle's search takes place in a future world dense with marvels and horrors: wide use of individually initiated teleportation (“jaunting”), heartless mega-corporations, occasional telepathy, vast underground prisons, a cargo cult with cool tattoos, a cathedral housing a circus, a mysterious substance (""PyrE"") which may either consume or transform our world, and the fragmentation of time.This is a very entertaining novel, but also a thoughtful one. Its ending is ambitious and outrageous, exalting The Hero, Democracy and Freedom, and yet acknowledging the ignorance, darkness and oppression from which these gifts inevitably spring. I can give it no better praise than to say I think Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, and Mr. and Mrs. Shelley--and, yes, Dumas pere too--would have liked it a lot.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/333867.The_Stars_My_Destination
Alas, Babylon;Pat Frank;1959;1950;323;4.08;46330;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Apocalyptic', 'Audiobook'];"“An extraordinary real picture of human beings numbed by catastrophe but still driven by the unconquerable determination of living creatures to keep on being alive.” — The New Yorker The classic apocalyptic novel by Pat Frank, first published in 1959 at the height of the Cold War, with an introduction by award-winning science fiction writer and scientist David Brin. “Alas, Babylon.” Those fateful words heralded the end. When the unthinkable nightmare of nuclear holocaust ravaged the United States, it was instant death for tens of millions of people; for survivors, it was a nightmare of hunger, sickness, and brutality. Overnight, a thousand years of civilization were stripped away. But for one small Florida town, miraculously spared against all the odds, the struggle was only just beginning, as the isolated survivors—men and women of all ages and races—found the courage to come together and confront the harrowing darkness.";"This book was published in 1959, and it feels like it every step of the way. The plot is compelling enough, but the writing is incredibly wooden. I actually laughed out loud at some of the passages, and not in a nice way. The author drags us through 100 pages of rising action, which is annoying because it adds nothing to the plot, and we all know the bomb is going to hit before we even read the blurb on the back cover. The racism and sexism are also pretty terrible. Even after the freakin' nuclear holocaust, the ""Negroes"" are doing all the housework. When the electricity goes out and they need to cook all the meat in the freezer, they can't decide whether to throw a ""mixed party."" People! The world just ended, and you can't decide whether or not to let black people come to your BBQ? Also, this: ""The more he learned about women the more there was to learn except that he had learned this: they needed a man around."" First of all, find a synonym for ""learn,"" please. Second, this was after the aforesaid male practically threw up at the sight of blood, ran out of the room, and one of the women had to take care of the injury. We may need you, buddy (after all, no electricity for vibrators in this grim future), but you need us too. If you're thinking of reading this book, check out ""The Road"" instead. Same idea, but the execution is about 1000x superior.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38169.Alas_Babylon
On the Beach;Nevil Shute;1957;1950;296;3.97;45722;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Dystopia', 'Apocalyptic', 'Australia'];After a nuclear World War III has destroyed most of the globe, the few remaining survivors in southern Australia await the radioactive cloud that is heading their way and bringing certain death to everyone in its path. Among them is an American submarine captain struggling to resist the knowledge that his wife and children in the United States must be dead. Then a faint Morse code signal is picked up, transmitting from somewhere near Seattle, and Captain Towers must lead his submarine crew on a bleak tour of the ruined world in a desperate search for signs of life. On the Beach is a remarkably convincing portrait of how ordinary people might face the most unimaginable nightmare.;"“It's not the end of the world at all,"" he said. ""It's only the end for us. The world will go on just the same, only we shan't be in it. I dare say it will get along all right without us.”

An Instructional Manual from 1951 on what to do in the event of an A-Bomb attack.On the Beach was published in 1957, but the novel is set in what was then the near future of 1963. Those years between 1957-1963 proved to be tumultuous years indeed. When I checked this book out of the library, the librarian, the same one who gave me such good material for my In Cold Blood review, said that this book terrified her, not because of the horrifying circumstances in the book, but the plodding calmness of the characters. I was intrigued.I wanted to ask what it was like to have read this book in 1957, but that is a rather delicate question to a woman of an indeterminate age. Luckily she bailed me out and told me she read the book much later, but still while we were up to our eyeballs in the Cold War. My Father has always said he has never been more afraid of the World Ending than in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. My bellwether librarian agreed that she remembered how difficult it was for everyone to go about their regular business with the oppressive presence of the eminent demise of civilization looming over their lives. (I paraphrase.)I still can’t quite peg her age. I could dig around a bit and probably discover her birth date, but then that wouldn’t be very sporting of me now would it? So it is the end of the world. 

John Riordan comic strip.
”In the last of meeting placesWe grope togetherAnd avoid speechGathered on this beach of the tumid river…This is the way the world endsThis is the way the world endsThis is the way the world endsNot with a bang but with a whimper.T. S. Eliot


Ok...so, Nevil Shute has the world ending with Albania attacking Italy. Egypt then bombed the United States and the United Kingdom. NATO bombed the Soviet Union because the planes used by the Egyptians were Soviet made. The Soviets bomb China because of Chinese attacks on their border. All of this bombing...well...is nuclear infused with cobalt to insure the maximum amount of radiation fallout. So those countries that were not involved in World War III, are fully involved in the dying part of the war. 

I glanced through some other reviews of this book. The people who didn’t like this book were looking for the standard apocalyptic novel with desperate people fleeing in front of the radiation (zombies, tidal wave, Ebola etc) hoping to live days longer or maybe even hoping for a reprieve. They wanted people clinging to every last drop of their remaining existence. I would guess that the book would have been more fulfilling for them if a pocket of those people had found a way to survive thus leaving them with some hope that they too could be among the survivors.This isn’t that kind of book. I’m sure there were people fleeing South, but Shute focuses on the people who stay in Melbourne. The people who are measuring their lifespan in days and minutes as word arrives of radiation sickness three hundred miles away, one hundred miles away. Dwight Towers, commander of probably the last remaining operational American submarine, has attached his vessel to the Australian Navy. He has a wife and kids in the United States. He is a practical man who knows logically they are dead, but he continues to think about them and talk about them as if they are alive. He meets Moira Davidson who drinks brandy around the clock, loses her top while swimming (see how fun she is!), and is coming to terms with the fact that she is never going to get married or do any of the things she hasn’t even thought of yet. 

1959 movie posterJohn Osborne is a scientist who has been attached as a liaison officer to the USS Scorpion. Shute was an aeronautical engineer by trade. His love for machines comes out in the Osborne character. John finds a Ferrari and buys it for pennies on the dollars, even for that price it seems like an act of pure lunacy, but he has always wanted to race cars and has a stash of fuel that will make that dream come true. He organizes the final Australian Grand Prix and so many drivers come out of the woodwork that they have to organize heats to determine the drivers for the final race. Peter Holmes is a lieutenant commander in the Australian Navy, receiving promotions so quickly due to resignations that he will soon be an admiral. He has a wife, Mary, and a daughter. He cuts down trees and expands the flower and vegetable garden. It gives Mary something to do, something to think about other than winds of death. Moria is discussing the strangeness of planting a garden with Dwight.“Someone’s crazy,” she said quietly. “Is it me or them?”“Why do you say that?”“They won’t be here in six months’ time. I won’t be here. You won’t be here. They wont’ want any vegetables next year.”

There are old men at the Gentlemen’s Club slowly depleting the last 100 bottles of port. There are debates about whether it is ethical to move the fishing season up. There are people still going to school trying to finish course work. The people who stay are trying to be as productive with their lives as if a normal life span was still stretching out before them. ”Typically for a Shute novel, the characters avoid expressing intense emotions and do not mope or indulge in self-pity. Some reviewers thought the characters were wooden. I found the calmness of the people populating this novel more terrifying than if they had been fleeing for their lives. There was a part of me that wanted to go shake some sense into them and extort them to help me come up with a plan, but as I started to accept the circumstances I realized that the only sane course was the course they were already on. Do you want to die in a tent surrounded by people you don’t know, going hungry more than likely; and yet, as doomed as if you’d stayed in your home surrounded by your friends and family? Do you want to take the chance that you will survive the apocalypse? I say put on a pot of tea, keep the bourbon close to hand, and finally finish War and Peace. Maybe there is even time for a quick nap in the hammock with the sun on my toes and bees buzzing by my ear.A fascinating, historical look back to when the threat of nuclear war hung like a shadow around the sun. ***4.25 out of 5 stars***If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38180.On_the_Beach
The City and the Stars;Arthur C. Clarke;1956;1950;255;4.08;34404;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];Clarke's masterful evocation of the far future of humanity, considered his finest novel.Men had built cities before, but never such a city as Diaspar. For millennia its protective dome shut out the creeping decay and danger of the world outside. Once, it held powers that rule the stars.But then, as legend has it, the invaders came, driving humanity into this last refuge. It takes one man, a Unique, to break through Diaspar's stifling inertia, to smash the legend and discover the true nature of the Invaders.;"The City and the Stars, Arthur C. Clarke The City and the Stars is a science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke, published in 1956. The City and the Stars takes place one billion years in the future, in the city of Diaspar. By this time, the Earth is so old that the oceans have gone and humanity has all but left. As far as the people of Diaspar know, theirs is the only city left on the planet. The city of Diaspar is completely enclosed. Nobody has come in or left the city for as long as anybody can remember, and everybody in Diaspar has an instinctive insular conservatism. The story behind this fear of venturing outside the city tells of a race of ruthless invaders which beat humanity back from the stars to Earth, and then made a deal that humanity could live—if they never left the planet. In Diaspar, the entire city is run by the Central Computer. Not only is the city repaired by machines, but the people themselves are created by the machines as well. The computer creates bodies for the people of Diaspar to live in and stores their minds in its memory at the end of their lives. At any time, only a small number of these people are actually living in Diaspar; the rest are retained in the computer's memory banks. All the currently existent people of Diaspar have had past ""lives"" within Diaspar except one person—Alvin, the main character of this story. He is one of only a very small number of ""Uniques"", different from everybody else in Diaspar, not only because he does not have any past lives to remember, but because instead of fearing the outside, he feels compelled to leave. Alvin has just come to the age where he is considered grown up, and is putting all his energies into trying to find a way out. Eventually, a character called Khedron the Jester helps Alvin use the central computer to find a way out of the city of Diaspar. This involves the discovery that in the remote past, Diaspar was linked to other cities by an underground transport system. This system still exists although its terminal was covered over and sealed with only a secret entrance left.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه سپتامبر سال 1993 مسلادیعنوان: شهر و ستارگان؛ نویسنده: آرتور سی کلارک؛ مترجم: محمدرضا عمادی؛ تهران، هرم، 1371؛ در 261ص؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20معنوان: شهر و ستارگان؛ نویسنده: آرتور سی کلارک؛ مترجم: حسین شهرابی؛ تهران کتابسرای تندیس، 1394؛ در 331ص؛ شابک9786001821790؛ چاپ دوم 1397؛در این داستان «کلارک» گام به دورانی میگذارند، که در آن دوران بشر به اوج توانایی‌های علمی، و پیشرفت‌های تکنولوژیک خویش رسیده، و به دورترین نقاط فضا، دست یافته است؛ اما خودپرستی و جاه طلبی بیمارگونه ی انسانها، آرامش کرات آسمانی، و ساکنان آنجا را نیز، سلب کرده؛ تا آنجا که اتحادی از موجودات فضایی، انسان را، وادار به بازگشت به زمین خویش میکنندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 21/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 20/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250024.The_City_and_the_Stars
The Puppet Masters;Robert A. Heinlein;1951;1950;416;3.88;33170;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Aliens'];First came the news that a flying saucer had landed in Iowa. Then came the announcement that the whole thing was a hoax. End of story. Case closed.Except that two agents of the most secret intelligence agency in the U.S. government were on the scene and disappeared without reporting back. Then four more follow up agents also disappeared. So the head of the agency and his two top agents went in and managed to get out with their discovery: an invasion is underway by slug-like aliens who can touch a human and completely control his or her mind. What the humans know, they know. What the slugs want, no matter what, the human will do. And most of Iowa is already under their control.Sam Cavanaugh was one of the agents who discovered the truth. Unfortunately, that was just before he was taken over by one of the aliens and began working for the invaders, with no will of his own. And he has just learned that a high official in the Treasury Department is now under control of the aliens. Since the Treasury Department includes the Secret Service, which safeguards the President of the United States, control of the entire nation is near at hand.;Heinlein, did you really combine a very sexist plot element with the assumption that no gay people exist as the icing on the cake of your very awkward, biased, and wanna be subliminal writing?Body horror initializationI don´t know how many mind control, body horror, parasite,… tropes had already been established at the moment Heinlein wrote this book, but it might certainly have had a massive impact on many pandemic, alien invasion, horror, and sci-fi works that followed and it has more suspense and settings than some of his other works.Conspiracy without a worldThe agent, spy, government conspiracy, aspect plays a small role too, but it´s more of a vehicle to give the characters options to talk too much. Worldbuilding and action are hold small, rare, and I often asked myself while reading why Heinlein didn´t go the info-dumping way in both directions, not just with monologues, but with worldbuilding too. Parasites grow bigHow to find a cure has so many interesting variants and the more creative people think about finding a solution to this annoying infiltration parasite symbiont problem, the more interesting plotlines evolve, be it focused on technical, biological, magical, or mental eradication of that nasty mind bugs.Conservative thoughtsThe language and the mentality of the main character are both strange and fascinating, it´s kind of listening to an old man with dubious mentalities reflecting about life, not questioning anything or being unsure about the rightness of his mentality, but more reveling in his own points of view and why he is right.Who cares about equalityHow common sexism and bigotry were and that it was a shocking revolution to dare to describe naked people may seem laughable nowadays, but the people really lived and thought like that and still do in many societies as if nudity was a crime. Because of this involuntary side effect of reflecting on human behavior, it´s a better read than it would have been because it´s one of Heinleins´ poorer works.Because there will always be controversy around Heinleins´ work and changing world views, I want to add some personal opinions at the end of the reviews It seems a bit as if Heinlein had been a lifelong searcher for the right ideology, as he switched from one extreme to the other, leaving marks of it throughout all of his works. This is the biggest contrast to others, who kept their work clean from bias and agenda and it certainly built both his legend, fanbase, and critics by provoking and polarizing. Of course, it´s the freedom of art to integrate serious elements, as long as they are not dangerous, but the thin red line tends to be pretty blurry and while some see him as a visionary for alternative society models others describe him as a conservative, hate-filled, unsure man. I don´t really care what his motives might have been, his work is something special and different, it´s just a prime example of why professional artists should keep their work clean from personal agendas, because that just, justifiably, feeds the trolls and ruins ones´ reputation as for example seen with the great three titans of sci-fi. Asimov: robots, psychohistory, foundation. Clarke: epic, subtle, philosophical, each time reading finding new depths, extremely complex. Heinlein: Meh, his writing was average, but did you know what kind of mindset he had regarding... See? While people will endlessly debate about the ingenuity of and inspiration from Asimovs´and Clarkes´work, they will remember Heinlein as the kind of strange uncle with borderline attitudes.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7171856-the-puppet-masters

Heinlein;1958;1950;276;3.92;30462;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure'];Kip from midwest Centerville USA works the summer before college as a pharmacy soda jerk, and wins an authentic stripped-down spacesuit in a soap contest. He answers a distress radio call from Peewee, scrawny rag doll-clutching genius aged 11. With the comforting cop Mother Thing, three-eyed tripod Wormfaces kidnap them to the Moon and Pluto.;My first Robert A. Heinlein work read and still one of my favorites.Heinlein produced his juvenile books for Charles Scribner's Sons mainly in the 1950s and these were what many consider to be some of his finest work. I’ve always thought that the period between 1957 and 1966 was his zenith, with good work before and after, but during this time was when he was at the height of his considerable powers.Have Space Suit Will Travel was first published by Scribner's in 1958 and so was a part of this high quality. Nominated for a Hugo award in 1959 (and what a cast that was! James Blish won for A Case of Conscience, and the other nominees were Robert Scheckley’s Immortality, Inc., Poul Anderson’s The Enemy Stars, and Algis Budrys’ Who?) this was on a short list of his best.Kip Russell wants to go to the moon. There begins a golden opportunity for SF in the Golden Age!Brimming with 50s kitsch, but in a loveable way, Heinlein appealed to his juvenile audience with a fun adventure story and to his growing older fans with some cool SF. Some of the more interesting RAH characters are here and also the beginnings of some of his more ubiquitous ideas like liberty, resourcefulness, self-reliance and determinism. My 2016 reread left me nostalgic and endearing, and more appreciative of his talent than before.*** 2024 reread - This early Heinlein book, part of the Scribner's juvenile series, has lost none of its potency over the years and definitely none since my last reread in 2016.This time I picked up on the powerful message brought to us by the Mother Thing and really enjoyed the Roman legionnaire from Spain.Maybe not one of his more thought provoking books, this one is a softball, but still good fun.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20417.Have_Space_Suit_Will_Travel
The Door Into Summer;Robert A. Heinlein;1957;1950;304;4.02;27114;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Audiobook'];Electronics engineer Dan Davis has finally made the invention of a lifetime: a household robot with extraordinary abilities, destined to dramatically change the landscape of everyday routine. Then, Dan was tricked by an unscrupulous greedy business partner and a greedier fiancee into spending thirty years in suspended animation, the long sleep, just when he was on the verge of a success beyond his wildest dreams.They never imagine that the future time in which Dan, a modern-day and future-time, Rip Van Winkle, will awaken has mastered time travel, giving him a way to get back to them, and at them, and get his revenge!.;"An enjoyable SF story from a Grandmaster.The novel's protagonist, Daniel B. Davis, was a precursor to Hugh Farnham and even Lazarus Long somewhat, though Long was introduced earlier in 1941's Methusaleh's Children. Actually, Davis (and others) are thinly disguised Heinlein: fiercely individualist, libertarian, technically savvy, hard working yet innovative, resourceful, wise cracking, and with a horn dog libido that would make a porn star blush. I wonder if Door Into Summer used some of the same notes and ideas that would later surface in Time Enough for Love? Door into Summer may be classified as a transitional book between the earlier juvenile works and his middle works (his apex, his high water mark) and then to the weird, time traveling and lusty later books. I think a better reviewer than me could even make the point that Heinlein had begun his ascendancy here.**** 2021 reread - I've thought about this wonderful book over the years and knew that it was time for a reread. Not sure why I stopped short with a 3 star rating last time but I've upgraded to a 4 star now.The premise for the title is that he and his cat had lived in an old farm house that had eleven doors. In the winter time he followed his cat to each, with the cat hoping to find one would open not to the cold winter landscape but rather a portal that would open to summer. This idea is repeated several times to show that one is looking for a good result, one better than even rationally hoped for.The premise of the book is fun as well. Engineer Dan gets swindled by his fiance and business partner and so he goes on ""the long sleep"". In the 1970 of this world, a person can be frozen to reawaken at a later time, while investments continue to grow with compound interest. When the sleeper awakes, it will be a later, more technologically advanced time and with a bundle of cash from a well managed portfolio. That's the idea but Bob has plenty of fun cooked up for us, including some more traditional time travel. Heinlein fans may compare this his short story ""All You Zombies"" and fans of Poul Anderson's time travel canon will also like this.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348.The_Door_Into_Summer
The Midwich Cuckoos;John Wyndham;1957;1950;220;3.91;26354;no;['Science Fiction', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];In the sleepy English village of Midwich, a mysterious silver object appears and all the inhabitants fall unconscious. A day later the object is gone and everyone awakens unharmed—except that all the women in the village are discovered to be pregnant.;"I can't remember when I first read The Midwich Cuckoos, but it was certainly within 30 years of the end of World War II. Now, almost 40 years later, the postwartime feel is even more present in this short novel, despite the book itself being published in 1957. The way the army moves in immediately, the jeeps on the road, meetings between people who clearly think of themselves as the elders of the village, the consequent emphasis on protecting ordinary people, the ""Grange"" with its important secret work, all these contribute to a work redolent with the ""stiff upper lip"" feeling of post-war British fiction.Although this novel is class-ridden, and the women's roles are very much of their time, it is told with a wry humour which I had forgotten in the aftermath of all the adaptations. The first of these goes by the name of ""Village of the Damned"", from 1960, and was followed shortly by a sequel ""Children of the Damned"". John Carpenter then remade ""Village of the Damned"" .in 1995. All these are good chilling films, but they are bound to lose the feel of the original text.The British reserve is very much in evidence in the novel, and Wyndham conveys the clipped ""BBC"" accent beautifully, with his ""Ihad"" or ""Ithink"" in reported conversation. At the beginning too, when the ""cuckoos"" are perceived, there is much embarrassment and avoidence of discussing how this might have happened. One exchange between the doctor and the vicar is hilarious as neither seem to want to spell out what they actually mean. It becomes obvious that the situation of every single female being pregnant at the same time is scientifically inexplicable. Nothing has ever really happened in Midwich (apart from some amusing historical episodes referred to in a droll fashion right at the start) yet the villagers just accept it and go on with their lives. Again, this is typical of the period. It's dangerous to ask questions. The authorities know best. You keep quiet and carry on.And indeed, the ""elders"" of the village do get together, and form a ""committee"" to discuss what is the best way to proceed for the good of them all. The key figures here are; Gordon Zellaby, an educated and insightful character (if this had been set any earlier he would have been the ""Lord of the Manor""); Doctor Willers, the village's GP; the vicar, and Bernard Westcott, the middle man between Midwich and the military, who is usually himself represented by the narrator, Richard Gayford (a published writer who represents ""Everyman"").We are thrust into the novel right in the middle of the ""Dayout"", when the village of Midwich seems to have been put to sleep. Army manoeuvres reveal that a hemisphere 2 miles in diameter surrounds the village. Then aerial photography shows an unidentifiable silvery object on the ground in the centre of the created exclusion zone.  This section of the text is told most entertainingly. Although there is an underlying sense of dread and chill, the ""indignant squawk"" of the canary, as it repeatedly falls off its perch each time it meets the invisible barrier which put it to sleep, and the description of people just seeming to conk out, is actually very funny.Critics of the novel have argued its implausibility; however was this all kept secret? Well, this was 1957, and we are told the village (a sleepy sort of place to start with!) was in an isolated position. It is a stretch to believe, but communications were extremely basic for ordinary folk then. And why, modern readers may ask, was abortion not suggested? Again, different times, different ethics. Abortion was a very rare event. Mostly unwanted pregnancies would end in adoption, and some of these in the story were very much wanted in any case. All the little cameos here are a treat to read. Such a variety of reactions from people very much of their time. The women I found to be especially interesting. Often novels written then tend to objectify women, but, class-ridden though they were, these women are believable as real characters. For the daughter of an educated well-to-do family it is perceived as a minor difficulty, but easily got round. Others less privileged went to dangerous lengths to avoid ever having to disclose the information. The description of the villagers' slow acceptance of the position is carefully controlled. Again, we feel a sense of the past in the communal solidarity and responsibility; there is a strong ethical code binding them together, whereas just a few miles away, as the character Ferelyn (the daughter of Zellaby, an important pivotal character in the novel) says, ""they don't want to believe it…they choose to believe that that is a tale to cover up something more normal but disgraceful."" There is both a sociological slant, and a psychological one, as Doctor Willers goes on to say that it is a ""self-protective reflex which defends the ordinary man and woman from disquieting beliefs.""Inventing the character of Professor Gordon Zellaby allows this novel to explore scientific hypotheses such as xenogenesis, or the supposed production of children who are markedly different from either of their parents. The narrator Richard Gayford has many indepth discussions with Zellaby, who is prone to philosophical digressions. He tends to soliloquise as he ruminates on various biological mechanisms. ""The laws evolved by one particular species, for the convenience of that species, are, by their nature, concerned only with the capacities of that species - against a species with different capacities they simply become inapplicable.""Zellaby is torn between his fascination with an unknown species; his desire to know more about them, and his dawning knowledge that  they will inevitably replace the human race. He has given himself the task of educating the Children, but when it is clear that they learn, and grow at an astonishing superhuman rate, and have abilities unknown to humans, then he deduces that humanity itself is under threat. Other countries have experienced the same phenomenon, and four other colonies have been planted and grown world-wide. All have either died or been destroyed. Clearly neither species will allow the other to survive, yet both politically and ethically, nobody wants to be the ones to destroy these Children. Bernard Westcott, who works for Military Intelligence, is keen to find a way forward, but the ethical issues within the political situation defeat him. At the start of the novel the narrator, and therefore the reader too, is unsure of Zellaby's astuteness. Indeed Zellaby is portrayed as some sort of ""nutty professor"". However by the end we are beginning to realise that Zellaby is the only person who sees the bigger picture, and is willing to take responsibility for what has to be done; ultimately to destroy the Children in order for humanity to survive. Angela Zellaby, the professor's wife acts as an intermediary between the ""committee"" set up to determine how to proceed, and the mothers. When the Children have begun to show their powers, using their telepathic and superhuman abilities to make people kill themselves, or fight each other, as a ""punishment"" for hurting them, Angela speaks out against them, saying that murder must never be tolerated. But Zellaby counters, ""You are judging by social rules and finding crime. I am considering an elemental struggle, and finding no crime - just grim, primeval danger."" At this point is is clear that Zellaby has come to his conclusions, the reader has been given a strong hint that this elderly man may be more ill than anyone realises, and given his strong ethical code, the ending is inevitable.The Children themselves form two basic entities - male and female - split into 61 ""components"". By the end they have lived for nine years, look sixteen, and have immeasurable intelligence. The characters in the novel assume a working formula of a 16 year old human's multiplied by the power of 30, but both they and we know that any human comparison is useless. Here Boy speaks for all the Children, trying to explain their position as they request to be moved elsewhere, and thereby putting off the inevitable confrontation between species which would lead to humanity's extinction.""We have both been given the same wish to survive, We are all, you see, toys of the life-force. It made you numerically stronger, but mentally undeveloped. It made us mentally strong but physically weak: now it has set us at one another, to see what will happen. A cruel sport perhaps, from both our points of view, but a very very old one. Cruelty is as old as life itself. There is some improvement: humour and compassion are the most important of human inventions; but they are not very firmly established yet, though promising well. But the life-force is a lot stronger than they are; and it won't be denied its blood-sports.""  It is a masterstroke by Wyndham to set this novel in the specific place - and time - that he did. You may not care for the parochialism, or the fuddy-duddy characters, but the claustrophobia and conservatism of a small village in England perfectly sets off the stark issue of basic survival. Zellaby said, this struggle is a ""fight that goes on perpetually, bitterly, lawlessly, without trace of mercy or compassion."" The character of Gordon Zellaby is a construction by John Wyndham, a mouthpiece to convey his important message, ""It is because nature is ruthless, hideous, and cruel beyond belief that it was necessary to invent civilisation."" And if civilisation breaks down, what then?There have been many imitations. The theme of raw survival runs constantly through SF. This novel makes you think, as all good fiction should. It does so with a wry humour, and a deadly sense of foreboding. Yes, it could be described as a ""cosy catastrophe"". But it incorporates elements from biology, physiology, sociology, psychology, and politics. And most of all, it incorporates ethics. To do this in such a breathlessly entertaining way indicates that this is a true, timeless classic.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/161846.The_Midwich_Cuckoos
Pebble in the Sky;Isaac Asimov;1950;1950;308;3.9;25311;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy'];One moment Joseph Schwartz is a happily retired tailor in 1949 Chicago. The next he's a helpless stranger on Earth during the heyday of the first Galactic Empire. Earth, he soon learns, is a backwater, just a pebble in the sky, despised by all the other 200 million planets of the Empire because its people dare to claim it's the original home of man. And Earth is poor, with great areas of radioactivity ruining much of its soil--so poor that everyone is sentenced to death at the age of sixty.Joseph Schwartz is sixty-two.This is young Isaac Asimov's first novel, full of wonders and ideas, the book that launched the novels of the Galactic Empire, culminating in the Foundation books and novels. It is also one of that select group of SF adventures that since the early 1950s has hooked generations of teenagers on reading science fiction. This is Golden Age SF at its finest.;"Robot/Empire/Foundation. Book #7 is the final 'Galactic Empire' series book, but much more significantly Asimov's first published novel (1950!). Despite very much a '1950s' feel sci-fi work, this is still set many many centuries in Earth's future; has an interesting and assertive female lead; has a core theme set around prejudice through the lens of a far future where Earth is on the very outskirts of the Galactic Empire, and the radioactive soaked planet and its 20 million sized population are generally seen, and treated as a backward people. 8 out of 12 for this very unpredictable story with some great twists!2021 read";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41820.Pebble_in_the_Sky

A radiation bomb planted in his dorm room changed him from an innocent student at the University of Earth to a marked man, fleeing desperately from an unknown assassin.He soon discovers that, many light-years away, his father, the highly respected Rancher of Widemos, has been murdered. Stunned, grief-stricken, and outraged, Biron is determined to uncover the reasons behind his father’s death, and becomes entangled in an intricate saga of rebellion, political intrigue, and espionage.The mystery takes him deep into space where he finds himself in a relentless struggle with the power-mad despots of Tyrann. Now it is not just a case of life or death for Biron, but a question of freedom for the galaxy.;Robot/Empire/Foundation. Book #5. and the first in the Empire series, pubilshed back in Asimov's early career (1951), and tellingly so judging on most of the way the main female character is portrayed in this very 1950's space-mystery drama that sees the young and naive protagonist and male university student, Biron Farrill get caught up in a far reaching mystery involving the dominant Tyraan empire and the arrest and sentencing of his powerful father. Very old school and dated mystery that doesn't really show the Asimov spark, bar the pre-empire world building. 6 out of 12.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41822.The_Stars_Like_Dust

Heinlein;1956;1950;243;3.91;23375;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Hugo Awards', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Speculative Fiction'];One minute, down and out actor Lorenzo Smythe was — as usual — in a bar, drinking away his troubles as he watched his career go down the tubes. Then a space pilot bought him a drink, and the next thing Smythe knew, he was shanghaied to Mars.Suddenly he found himself agreeing to the most difficult role of his career: impersonating an important politician who had been kidnapped. Peace with the Martians was at stake — failure to pull off the act could result in interplanetary war. And Smythe's own life was on the line — for if he wasn't assassinated, there was always the possibility that he might be trapped in his new role forever!;Really enjoyed this. Heinlein's first but least recognized Hugo Award winner. Like many of his better works, this is a science fiction vehicle that he uses to discuss other issues, here he spends time with politics, maybe even adding some subtle, and not too subtle ideas about what he thinks is right and wrong in politics. Not consistent with other novels about Martians, or his future fiction in other books, but excellent characterization and a fun story. Borrows heavily from the Prisoner of Zenda theme.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175324.Double_Star
Invasion of the Body Snatchers;Jack Finney;1955;1950;224;3.89;23350;no;['Science Fiction', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Thriller', 'Aliens'];On a quiet fall evening in the small, peaceful town of Mill Valley, California, Dr. Miles Bennell discovered an insidious, horrifying plot. Silently, subtly, almost imperceptibly, alien life-forms were taking over the bodies and minds of his neighbors, his friends, his family, the woman he loved—the world as he knew it. First published in 1955, this classic thriller of the ultimate alien invasion and the triumph of the human spirit over an invisible enemy inspired three major motion pictures.;"One of the most original SF novels I have ever read - the undercurrent commentary on socialization and identification of 'otherness' should put this book on the shelf of anyone studying social science; the way society falls apart is represented in a unique and chilling way that will stay with you long after you finish this book.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127515.Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers

Americans are fiercely proud of their re-won liberties and the blood it cost them: nothing could make them forswear those truths they hold self-evident.

The Currents of Space;Isaac Asimov;1952;1950;304;3.85;20136;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Classics', 'Fantasy'];High above the planet Florinia, the Squires of Sark live in unimaginable wealth and comfort. Down in the eternal spring of the planet, however, the native Florinians labor ceaselessly to produce the precious kyrt that brings prosperity to their Sarkite masters. Rebellion is unthinkable and impossible. Not only do the Florinians no longer have a concept of freedom, any disruption of the vital kyrt trade would cause other planets to rise in protest, ultimately destabilizing trade and resulting in a galactic war. So the Trantorian Empire, whose grand plan is to unite all humanity in peace, prosperity, and freedom, has stood aside and allowed the oppression to continue. Living among the workers of Florinia, Rik is a man without a memory or a past. He has been abducted and brainwashed. Barely able to speak or care for himself when he was found, Rik is widely regarded as a simpleton by the worker community where he lives. But as his memories begin to return, Rik finds himself driven by a cryptic message he is determined to deliver: Everyone on Florinia is doomed . . . the Currents of Space are bringing destruction. But if the planet is evacuated, the power of Sark will end--so some would finish the job and would kill the messenger. The fate of the Galaxy hangs in the balance.;"Robot/Empire/Foundation. Book #6 and the second book (but last written) in the Galactic Empire era of the Foundation/Robots universe, published back in Asimov's early career (1952). In the Galactic Empire is growing, but the second most powerful force in the cosmos is Sark, because of the wealth it gets from the pretty horrific subjugation of a planet, which is the sole source of a very valuable raw material. An amnesiac Earthman on the planet starts to get his memory back, which sets up race against time to get the information he has forgotten (or to stop him from sharing) between the Empire, Sark, the natives of the planet and possibly other forces. The information he has lost, is linked to a 'currents of space' theory.Not so much a sci-fi read, but a very good global mystery thriller set in the far future. Despite the 21st century criticisms of Asimov, there are strong positive roles for the main female protagonists despite 2 of the 3 forces have male dominated cultures; the 'dark skinned' people are the good guys; and the 'baddies' are very multi-faceted.

More Than Human;Theodore Sturgeon;1953;1950;186;3.94;18545;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction'];There's Lone, the simpleton who can hear other people's thoughts and make a man blow his brains out just by looking at him. There's Janie, who moves things without touching them, and there are the teleporting twins, who can travel ten feet or ten miles. There's Baby, who invented an antigravity engine while still in the cradle, and Gerry, who has everything it takes to run the world except for a conscience. Separately, they are talented freaks. Together, they compose a single organism that may represent the next step in evolution, and the final chapter in the history of the human race.In this genre-bending novel - among the first to have launched scifi into the arena of literature - one of the great imaginers of the twentieth century tells a story as mind-blowing as any controlled substance and as affecting as a glimpse into a stranger's soul. For as the protagonists of More Than Human struggle to find who they are and whether they are meant to help humanity or destroy it. Theodore Sturgeon explores questions of power and morality, individuality and belonging, with suspense, pathos, and a lyricism rarely seen in science fiction.;If you have ever been lonely and longed for completion, you will be drawn to this book. But if you are one of those rare souls who sense that completion demands more than a wife or a husband, who yearn to find a small group of friends like yourself--but different--who can believe and will the same thing and yet still manage to preserve their distinctive humanity, then this book is the thing for you.More Than Human is about six people—each with a distinct and extraordinary power—who wander lost and damaged until they discover one another. When they do, they begin to realize that together they constitute a new form of life—homo gestalt, they call themselves—which might just be the next step in human evolution.This is an extraordinary, resonant book. Stylistically and structurally, it's The Sound and the Fury of science fiction novels: the tale of an idiot not an quite idiot, whose tale--not as simple as it seems—is bound up with the narratives and lives of others which give his story its meaning. It has passages of loneliness as fierce as anything you will find in Job, Robinson Crusoe, Hunger, or Native Son, and yet everything in it points toward love, despite the bleakest of conditions. Best of all, it ends with a surprising revelation that leaves the reader with the conviction that there is indeed hope for the future without in any way diminishing the challenges and the loneliness of the individual human life.Sturgeon was always an accomplished writer, but in this book he outdid himself. This is one of the science fiction books that—even now, more than fifty years later--needs to be read.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/541024.More_Than_Human
Citizen of the Galaxy;Robert A. Heinlein;1957;1950;282;4.01;17182;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Classics'];In a distant galaxy, the atrocity of slavery was alive and well, and young Thorby was just another orphaned boy sold at auction. But his new owner, Baslim, is not the disabled beggar he appears to be: adopting Thorby as his son, he fights relentlessly as an abolitionist spy. When the authorities close in on Baslim, Thorby must ride with the Free Traders — a league of merchant princes — throughout the many worlds of a hostile galaxy, finding the courage to live by his wits and fight his way from society's lowest rung. But Thorby's destiny will be forever changed when he discovers the truth about his own identity...;Citizen of the Galaxy by Robert A, Heinlein was first published in 1957 and is generally considered one of his juvenile novels as Scribner’s published it. An astute reader of Heinlein, though, may consider that this was published just a year before Have Space Suit—Will Travel, the last of the Scribner’s juveniles, in the same year as The Door Into Summer and only four years before Stranger in a Strange Land, so his transition from the more typical pure science bildungsroman of his earlier works and a more mature, serious work of the sixties had begun. Without a doubt, Heinlein reached his zenith in the sixties with The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Stranger in a Strange Land and Starship Troopers (actually published in 1959). Citizen of the Galaxy could be seen as an early embarkation towards these classics.Telling the tale of Thorby and his journeys as a slave, a beggar, a trader, a soldier and finally as a tycoon, Heinlein uses the tale as a vehicle to explore many futuristic ideas still grounded in everyday life. Heinlein succeeds as he has in so many of his works, by creating an entertaining story while at the same time using the science fiction as an allegory to describe his libertarian ideals about a great many subjects such as family relationships and dynamics, freedom, work ethics, and loyalty. Slavery is a central subject of the novel and Heinlein spends his time well with some provocative dialogue. At the end of the day, Heinlein is a great writer simply because he tells a good story. Give him that he provokes thought from his reader and that the story works well on more than one level, and Heinlein has once again delivered a good read.*** 2023 reread - Debts must be paid.Heinlein first published Citizen of the Galaxy in 1957 and was the second to last of the published Scribner’s juvenile books. A story goes that he presented his 1959 book Starship Troopers to Scribner’s and they rejected it and that wonderful run of books was over.Reading Citizen we can see that Heinlein was bursting out of the juvenile mold and was exploring more and more mature themes.Heinlein’s Bildungsroman is an attack on slavery in all it’s forms, both actual bonded loss of legal freedom as well as more subtle kinds of slavery, where individuals’ free will is sublimated to an outside source.Finally, it occurred to me that this may be the farthest out in time of his juveniles, maybe of any of his books. We can usually see a connection not just to Terra, but of our civilization. This would need to be hundreds, maybe thousands of years in the future of Heinlein’s “Future History” world building.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16689.Citizen_of_the_Galaxy
Time Out of Joint;Philip K. Dick;1959;1950;255;3.86;15148;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Novels', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Speculative Fiction'];Ragle Gumm is an ordinary man leading an ordinary life, except that he makes his living by entering a newspaper contest every day - and winning, every day.But he gradually begins to suspect that his life - indeed his whole world - is an illusion, constructed around him for the express purpose of keeping him docile and happy. But if that is the case, what is his real world like, and what is he actually doing every day when he thinks he is guessing 'Where Will The Little Green Man Be Next?';"Below the Surface of Things Under the Hydrogen BombNo one takes the immaterialist philosophy of the 17th century Bishop Berkeley seriously today - that being is a result of being perceived. But perhaps we should. Isn’t this what quantum theory suggests, that only when something is noticed or measured does it become definite? And, at a more quotidian level, isn’t Berkeley’s kind of immaterialism the foundation of advertising in all its forms, from retail selling, to political campaigning, to the generating of national feeling? The only thing real is what is perceived to be real by enough people.In Time Out of Joint, Dick explicitly takes the dear bishop at his word. But then Dick picks at a particularly loose thread. For Berkeley’s theory to work not only does everyone need to have the same perceptions, but the perceptions of each individual have to be consistent. Any dissonance among people or within anyone’s mind is problematic. Such dissonance causes doubt, and therefore inquiry, and eventually comparison of perceptions and judgments of which are right and which erroneous. Such is the perennial problem in any totalitarian state which attempts to control perception. Even the slightest lapse in propagandistic discipline will lead to trouble.Despite their self-perception, Americans in the 1950’s lived in an arguably totalitarian state. Their perceptions of freedom was their reality. The uniformity of opinion, the banality of life, the striving to get on, the universally concealed envy, attachment to celebrity, and the vague anti-intellectualism were all part of what they meant by freedom. The shared fear of Communism and the H-bomb was a unifying perception created and sustained by government propaganda. Bishop Berkeley had been right, and America proved it. But who watches the watchers? Who influences the influencers? Who sets the agenda for the agenda-setters? Perceptions spread like Chinese whispers, subtly evolving as they get passed on. And they’re inevitably circular; they get passed back to those who initially generated them. The big problem that the totalitarian state has is not insurrection but believing its own press. At that point its society loses touch with anything outside itself; it becomes psychotic.Those who suspect things are not as they seem consider it is they who are psychotic. As one of Dick’s characters says to himself, “We have a hodge-podge of leaks in our reality... A drop here, a couple of drops over in that corner. A moist spot forming on the ceiling. But where's it getting in? What's it mean?” Exactly: the beginning of the end. Eventually the dam has to break and reality rushes in. Bishop Berkeley hadn’t considered death very seriously - the ultimate reality which certainly doesn’t depend on perception.Postscript: Time Out of Joint was published in 1959. Exactly 30 years later, an episode of the television series, The Twilight Zone, entitled ‘Special Service’ had a suspiciously similar plot but no credit to Dick. Almost a decade later, the film The Truman Show was produced based on the  episode. The film emphasised the sci-fi aspects of the script, making it even more like Dick’s story. Once again no credit was given to Dick. One is entitled to suspect some nefarious literary activities - right in line with the theme of Time Out of Joint. It was also produced in the same year in which the book is set. An irony about ironies? And in case you missed it just a little further below the surface: Ragle is Elgar backwards. Elgar’s 14 Enigma Variations each portray a person. Worth investigation by some young intellect with time on their hands.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/698034.Time_Out_of_Joint

But something has gone terribly wrong...and now Rod Walker and his fellow students are stranded somewhere unknown in the universe, beyond contact with Earth, at the other end of a tunnel in the sky. Stripped of all comforts, hoping for a passage home that may never appear, the castaways must band together or perish. For Rod and his fellow survivors, this is one test where failure is not an option....;Very original and entertaining Heinlein adventure.This was one of my favorite Heinlein juvenile books and concerns a Stargate type of portal (did this influence the later films?) where colonists are sent out into the farther reaches of the universe. But before a band of colonists would attempt to settle a planet, adventurous types would go out first to provide reconnaissance and determine of the habitat was livable.Many of Heinlein's later ideas are revealed here, and his hard scrabble libertarianism blossoms. Many scenes anticipate his later work Time Enough for Love. I also think about Philip K. Dick's novel The Crack in Space.**** 2021 rereadThis was one of my favorite Heinlein juvenile books back in the day and it hasn’t lost any of its potency or relevance in all the time since.First published in 1955, a year after Lord of the Flies, comparisons with that great work will be drawn immediately. Both books describe a scene where children have been left alone in a savage environment and how their society changes to adapt to the new setting.Heinlein’s story may have been a response to Golding’s seminal novel. Ever the optimist, Heinlein’s group of students deal with environmental pressures, but don’t resort to barbarity. While Heinlein introduces some scenes where characters shirk convention and lean towards a might makes right sentiment, his group of accidental colonists hold firm ideas of civil society and community.The idea of space travel through “tunnels” in space, a kind of teleportation, effectively supplanting mechanical travel is also cool and would influence science fiction ever since.Very cool book, a must read for SF fans.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16683.Tunnel_in_the_Sky
The Space Merchants;Frederik Pohl;1952;1950;186;3.84;10772;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction'];An alternate cover edition can be found here.It is the 22nd Century, an advertisement-drenched world in which the big ad agencies dominate governments and everything else. Now Schoken Associates, one of the big players, has a new challenge for star copywriter Mitch Courtenay. Volunteers are needed to colonise Venus. It's a hellhole, and nobody who knew anything about it would dream of signing up. But by the time Mitch has finished, they will be queuing to get on board the spaceships.Biographical NotesPohl and Kornbluth started writing together as early as 1940, although both authors produced a wide variety of stories separately, under their own names and pseudonyms.Each wrote sections, starting where the other left off, and through long experience they developed an almost telepathic awareness of each other's intentions.;"Are you one of those people who miss Madmen desperately? Do you also have a taste for classic science fiction? If so, here is a book that could have been created just for you. Published in 1953, The Space Merchants tells the story of the USA some centuries hence, a land still stuck in the morals and mores of the Madmen era, with sexist men who take their privilege as a given and take their sexy (and intelligent, and capable) women for granted. But things are much worse in the future than they were in the 50's. Population is soaring, nature polluted, wildlife decimated, fossil fuels exhausted. The quality of peoples' lives, the wealthy not excepted, is poor: even luxury apartments are tiny, food is synthetic and tasteless, and the bicycle rickshaw has replaced the limousine. It's a good thing they have addictive snacks and drinks—like “Coffiest""—to drug everybody into thinking they are happy.Now who would you put in charge of a world like this, a world where the most important thing is to make people who have every reason to be miserable think they aren't miserable after all? Why, advertising agencies, of course!Enter our hero, Mitch Courtenay, an advertising executive, who—like most great salesmen—is an expert at fooling himself. He has been put in charge of his agency's efforts to win as a “client” the colonization of Venus (the total package, including promotion, exploration, logistics, and construction), but mysterious forces have begun to interfere. Are these the machinations of his firm's powerful rival? Or of the dreaded Consies (ecological terrorists)? Or could it be somebody else entirely? Then Courtenay is kidnapped, his identity wiped from the records, and soon he finds himself a virtual prisoner, condemned to slave labor. It is then that he learns, to his dismay, about the rank human misery his civilization creates to fuel its survival.You could do a lot worse than to give this book a try. It is outdated, but that is part of its charm. Its prose is straightforward and muscular, and what it lacks in elegance it makes up for in clarity and the briskness of its pace. Besides, it gives you the opportunity to meet “Chicken Little.” (Who--or what--is “Chicken Little”? Don't ask. There are some horrors, o reader, you must discover for yourself.)";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/392566.The_Space_Merchants
The Kraken Wakes;John Wyndham;1953;1950;240;3.77;10359;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook'];Ships are sinking for no apparent reason, carrying hundreds to a dark underwater grave. Strange fireballs race through the sky above the deepest trenches of the oceans. Something is about to show itself, something terrible and alien, a force capable of causing global catastrophe.;As I read this I realised that the more people died the better I liked it. What does that say about me? Nothing you hadn’t already guessed. But the action in this story of an alien invasion only really kicks off on page 140 and that’s a long time to spend in the company of an irritating smug English bastard from 1955 with a perky clever wife called Phyllis without anybody dying. It’s immediately obvious that this husband-and-wife team is a would-be English version of Nick & Nora from the Thin Man movies but their unsnappy witfree and icky dialogue is like to set your teeth on edge. Still, I ended up liking this novel because I enjoyed the very thing that other reviewers hated – there ain’t no Kraken in the whole book! I remember somebody coming back from seeing Rosemary’s Baby once. We asked him “what was it like?” and he said “You don’t see it.” He seemed as if he wanted his money back. But I loved the idea of never seeing the aliens who are invading you, and never even finding out if they even have faces! They live in the ocean deeps, yes, and they are attacking us, but do they even have a face?? Maybe they’re just intelligent slime! The aliens take their own damned time to invade the land and the story drags until they start sending sea tanks with extruding blobs which lasso any citizens they can find with a lot of fronds then drag the dead or dying back into the ocean. What for? Don’t ask me, pal. Maybe burgers?There were some unexpected contemporary resonances in this old fashioned book. When the aliens in the deeps start destroying ships people dismiss the whole idea as a conspiracy – what? Aliens? Don’t be silly. It’s those Communists. But the government can’t admit it, you see. Later when the aliens send in the sea tanks with blobs they start in some far-flung places and all reports that reach the west are thought of as fake news. Oh and also, the aliens finally figure out what diabolical weapon to use to exterminate people : ice cap melting. Something that we might be doing to ourselves quite soon. In case you were wondering, it takes five years for the aliens to completely wreck the planet. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!I was somewhat shaken by this on p168:The name of Her Majesty the Queen headed the list of subscribers for the relief of etc etc – this is the SAME Her Majesty that we have now! This novel was published in 1953! And we have the same queen now in 2021! Wow!And finally : an extra point to John Wyndham for the use of the word tsunami on p67, that must have been the first tsunami in an English novel.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91092.The_Kraken_Wakes
The Death of Grass;John Christopher;1956;1950;224;3.88;10060;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Dystopia', 'Apocalyptic', 'Classics', 'Horror'];The Chung-Li virus has devastated Asia, wiping out the rice crop and leaving riots and mass starvation in its wake. The rest of the world looks on with concern, though safe in the expectation that a counter-virus will be developed any day. Then Chung-Li mutates and spreads. Wheat, barley, oats, rye: no grass crop is safe, and global famine threatens.In Britain, where green fields are fast turning brown, the Government lies to its citizens, devising secret plans to preserve the lives of a few at the expense of the many.Getting wind of what's in store, John Custance and his family decide they must abandon their London home to head for the sanctuary of his brother's farm in a remote northern valley.And so they begin the long trek across a country fast descending into barbarism, where the law of the gun prevails, and the civilized values they once took for granted become the price they must pay if they are to survive.;"”Pity always was a luxury. It’s all right if the tragedy’s a comfortable distance away--if you can watch it from a seat in the cinema. It’s different when you find it on your doorstep--on every doorstep.”

Red Rice FieldIt was called the Chung-Li Virus and first appeared by destroying the rice crops in China. ""That is too bad, those poor Chinese."" ""What did you think of the coffee today wasn’t it bold? It is from somewhere in Africa. We’ll have to get more of that."" ""I hear the Americans are sending some cargo ships of food to China.""""Terrible about the rioting and the killing. I’ve heard as many as two million are dead already. """"So are we still on for tennis tomorrow?"" ""You don’t suppose that problem in China is going to become an issue for us?""""The Americans say they have a line on it. Hopefully the whole frightful mess will be cleared up by spring."" ""What did you think of that kid from Liverpool last night? That goal he made was nearly impossible.""”A long time ago. I came to the understanding that all men are friends by convenience and enemies by choice.”When the grass turns brown you might think to yourself...damn my lawn looks like crap quickly followed by woohoo no more mowing...followed by wait don’t cows eat grass?...followed by, but I like cheeseburgers. Of course as the landscape continues to turn brown you might start to become more educated about grass. It isn’t just the green stuff we cultivate all summer. In my case, due to frequent drought I water, cut, water, cut (sort of ridiculous if one gave it much thought), and I do this because green grass looks pretty. Grass happens to also be the stuff we eat. Rice, Wheat, Barley, and Corn all evolved from grass. Humans found these tiny seeds tasty. Instead of slogging all over the place and finding them by chance they decided to start growing these grains closer to where they lived. They kept the sweetest tasting kernels to plant the next year, slowly evolving each crop into the best grain to fit their palates. These grasses were not having to fight for survival any more. They had convinced humans to be their caretakers. It was a fiendish plot of survival that worked extremely well. 

Now there is a city girl getting prepared.Eventually this all leads to more and more people having time to do other things instead of spending all day trying to find something to eat. This brings us to John and David, grandsons of a farmer. In the not so distant past both boys would have been needed on the farm. In fact it would have been helpful if their mother had conceived a brood instead of a duo. In 1956 only one is needed on the farm, and the other is allowed to pursue his dreams in London as an engineer. The grass turns brown all over England and suddenly China isn’t this distant land with terrible problems. It is now on England’s doorstep. All the staple crops turn brown. Civilization, so carefully conceived from our brilliant nurturing of our food supply, teeters, and falls practically overnight. The powers-that-be, governments, police, elected officials only have power as long as we let them. Suddenly everyone is a government of one. A grass virus is very, very bad. So who do you save?John has an ace in the hole. He still has direct ties to a farm. His brother David will take him and his family in, but who else? To reach the farm, John is going to need friends and form alliances with people he doesn’t know. He is going to have to make choices about who he will save and who he can not. He will have to do things he never even in his darkest nightmares ever thought he would have to do. As he amasses more and more people who turn out to be essential for actually achieving his goal of reaching the farm he is creating a new problem.Too many mouths to feed. So who do you save?

Wheat FieldI was watching this show the other day about this guy who bought this old cold war missile silo in the middle of Kansas. He has built a premium self-sufficient shelter against the next insert name disaster. He is selling suites of rooms in this structure for $2million each. He has a fence. He has state of the art filtration system. He has retired navy seals. He has hydroponics, but you better like fish...a lot. I came away with two questions.First how are these A-Listers going to make it to Kansas to survive the next plague? This book explores that very concept and it turned out to be an excellent choice of reading after seeing this show. Two, I personally am not sure that I want to survive the next epic disaster. Surviving for what? And what will I be forced to do to survive? Who will I become to survive?Civilization, as creaky as it seems at times, is a wonderful, wonderful thing. So when you shell out $2million for your deluxe apartment underground in Kansas you can bring nine people with you. If you really want to scare yourself sometime sit down and put together your list. Think about all the people you care about and also the people that you feel could be essential to your future survival. Weight and measure all of them and for just a moment play GOD. Who do you save? Maybe the person you don’t save is yourself.

But his father would not hear of it -- far too dangerous a mission!Bill finally talked his way aboard the colony ship Mayflower -- and discovered his father was right!;The title tells it all, but this is also a very entertaining book, good read.**** 2020 re-readThere are some people who can tell you about a trip to the post office and make it interesting. Stephen King famously told about a rabid dog, filed up a novel with said rabid dog story, and it was actually pretty good.Robert A. Heinlein, is such a writer. Describing a far future world where the Earth is facing overpopulation and scarcity problems, one solution available to Terrans is to join up to be colonists.Our hero, leaping off the pages of Boys Life Magazine in Heinlein’s 1950 Scribner’s juvenile publication, learns that farming on Ganymede is much different than his agricultural chores on Earth. Heinlein demonstrates the charm of his juvenile work as he explores determination, family, perseverance and hard work.One of his better juvenile works this one earned a “Retro” Hugo in 2001.*** 2023 reread - One of his earlier books, first published in 1950, this is also a demonstration of his hard science sensibilities.It’s Golden Age Science Fiction, not the Andy Weir SF realism we see today, but for it’s time, this was technically challenging and thought provoking. And like many - most - of his writing, this tells a surface story while also delving into some deeper subjects.Right out of the gate we have some Malthusian economics and over population. How to deal with too many people folks needing some elbow room? Why, put them on a rocket and send them off to far Ganymede. But, isn’t that too cold? Sure, unless you terraform it! Hey, it’s 1950, have some fun.This was first serialized in Boy’s Life magazine and there is more than a passing mention of scouts and scouting and if you imagine a Scouts handbook but tailored to fit a terraformed colony fighting for self sufficiency, you can see some of the charm.One mistake many critics of Heinlein’s Scribners juvenile series (of which this is one) is to consider that these were written by a young man. Bob was 43 when this came out. Reading Grumbles from the Grave reveals how Heinlein’s homey delivery was carefully and artfully constructed for a book sales purpose. The author brought a good deal of real world experience to this work.The first half of the book was of the colonists leaving Earth and getting there and the second half is of the hard working and industrious folks taking care of business and dealing with conflict.Wonderful book.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50851.Farmer_in_the_Sky
Time for the Stars;Robert A. Heinlein;1956;1950;256;3.98;9415;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Classics'];"This is one of the classic titles originally know as the ""Heinlein Juveniles,"" written in the 1950 and published for the young adult market. It has since been in print for 50 years in paperback, and now returns to hardcover for a new generation.Travel to other planets is a reality, and with overpopulation stretching the resources of Earth, the necessity to find habitable worlds is growing ever more urgent. With no time to wait years for communication between slower-than-light spaceships and home, the Long Range Foundation explores an unlikely solution--human telepathy.Identical twins Tom and Pat are enlisted to be the human radios that will keep the ships in contact with Earth. The only problem is that one of them has to stay behind, and that one will grow old while the other explores the depths of space.Always a master of insight into the human consequences of future technologies, this is one of Heinlein's triumphs.";*** 2023 reread - This really is one of his best, probably certainly the best juvenile.What’s so great about it?Good question, this was not on my radar at all until I read it a few years ago. You always hear about the “big three” from Heinlein: Stranger in a Strange Land, Starship Troopers, and Moon is a Harsh Mistress. These three were first published in 1961, 1959 and 1966 respectively. Technically Starship Troopers is generally included as a part of Heinlein’s “early” novels but thematically this is more a part of the middle period, what I consider to be the height of his powers. Time For the Stars was first published in 1956, and was the tenth of twelve of Scribner’s juveniles.First of all, there’s just a lot going on. There is telepathy between an Earth bound partner and a starboard astronaut, allowing extreme distant travel to be able to communicate with Earth instantaneously.There is also lots of technical scientific and engineering talk about getting out to the stars and then there is alien contact and Bob really played this up for the kids with adventure and danger and shipboard drama. As in Joe Haldeman’s magnificent Forever War, and Poul Anderson’s Kith stories, we also play around with time relativity and the odd phenomena of star travelers aging slower than the folks on Earth.And here is where we come to what I’m talking about this being so good. The title is a play on words: “time” for the stars about the relativity issues, but also the simultaneity of the communications (which provides some more fun) but most importantly, that time for the stars means time from humanity, the opportunity cost of exploration.In the book there is a class of spaceships and they are all named for famous explores like Lewis and Clark and Robert Byrd and Columbus. This is a none too subtle examination of a type of person who leaves hearth and home behind to find something new. Heinlein usually has better than average characterization but here he takes extra time to explore the relationships between those who go to space and those who remain behind. Heinlein examines the human cost of leaving humanity behind, for the sake of humanity.It’s a fun book for the YA crowd, as intended, but with much more for a discerning reader.**(Original review) The Corsican Brothers go to space.Or at least one of them.First published in 1956, Heinlein’s Time for the Stars is one of his Scribner’s juvenile books, and one of the better ones, somewhat similar to Starman Jones. The Grandmaster tells the story of the first survey ships going out into deep space to look for suitable planets for humanity to colonize due to overpopulation on Earth. Needing a simultaneous communications system, the powers that be hire on groups of telepathic twins (or triplets) to provide real time coms between the ship and Earth. (Ten years before Ursula K. LeGuin’s ansible, which was first described in her 1966 novel Rocannon's World.Central to the narrative is the accepted theory of special relativity, whereby a voyager on a spaceship traveling at close to light speed will experience a different time than a person on Earth. The protagonist aboard the Lewis and Clark remains relatively young while his telepathic twin on Earth grows old. This concept is also explored in Joe Haldeman’s The Forever War and most notably in Poul Anderson’s Tau Zero.Heinlein also explores the concept of faster than light travel and these ideas may have been included in his notes for the novel that would be completed and published after his death by Spider Robinson in Variable Star.A good friend of mine suggested that a reader who favors Heinlein’s early / juvenile works over his middle works from the sixties and his later experiments with the tacky and wacky feels this way because that was the reader’s first exposure to Heinlein’s work. This could be true, as I have always liked his juveniles and these were my first books of his I read. In whichever camp one finds himself, Time for the Stats is one of his better novels.My final point to make on this book is an unusual observation about Heinlein’s work in general. According to Goodreads, Time for the Stars is my thirty-second Heinlein book. Bob mentions cannibalism in a lot of his works. Weird, creepy, unusual. By my recollection, I think he has mentioned cannibalism in each of the following works:Orphans of the SkyStranger in a Strange LandTime for the StarsFarnham's FreeholdFor Us, the Living: A Comedy of CustomsMethuselah's ChildrenThe Cat Who Walks Through WallsThe Moon Is a Harsh MistressStarship Troopers;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/356.Time_for_the_Stars
Starman Jones;Robert A.

To get into space you either needed connections, a membership in the Guild, or a whole lot more money than Max, the son of a widowed, poor mother, was ever going to have. What Max does have going for him are his uncle’s prized astrogation manuals—book on star navigation that Max literally commits to memory word for word, equation for equation. From the First Golden Age of Heinlein, this is the so-called juvenile (written, Heinlein always claims, just as much for adults) that started them all and made Heinlein a legend for multiple generations of readers.;Astrogators in space!One of Heinlein's earlier juvenile novels, this is one where RAH describes in great detail the machinations of the astrogators, quite a bit dated now with computers and it is amusing to imagine as he did a trio of math geniuses sitting in chairs with slide rules charting out a space ship's course, but that was part of his charm. Some thin characterizations along with some very 1950sish language, but Heinlein was working his very peculiar magic and this is all the while a fine sci-fi story.**** 2019 Re-readWas this 1953 publication an influence on Star Trek the original series and Lost in Space? Was Max Jones an idea for James Kirk?Their characters are very different, but this bildungsroman does follow our protagonist from farm boy to ship’s captain in spectacular fashion in a way that would be suited to fiery Kirk. The description of 3D chess would indicate the possibility that Roddenberry and crew had read this. Likewise, getting some decimals misplaced resulted in the spaceship in Heinlein’s story to be lost could have been a seed for the later 1965 TV series.Heinlein published his twelve Scribner’s juvenile books between 1947 and 1958 and this one is the seventh. Starman Jones describes Max Jones’ journey from the hills of the Ozarks to command of the Starship Asgard and the many adventures he had on the way.This is packed full of Heinlein’s campy wisecracks and homey logic, but also tells a damn fine SF story and one particularly enjoyable to anyone who’s stood watch of naval ships as RAH adds his personal knowledge of all things nautical and in his own inimitable way.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/351.Starman_Jones
The Shrinking Man;Richard Matheson;1956;1950;201;3.78;8595;no;['Science Fiction', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Audiobook'];While on holiday, Scott Carey is exposed to a cloud of radioactive spray shortly after he accidentally ingests insecticide. The radioactivity acts as a catalyst for the bug spray, causing his body to shrink at a rate of approximately 1/7 of an inch per day. A few weeks later, Carey can no longer deny the truth: not only is he losing weight, he is also shorter than he was and deduces, to his dismay, that his body will continue to shrink.;Posted at Shelf Inflicted After reading about white male privilege, racial oppression, and gender inequality, I found it interesting that I chose to read a book about a man who is losing his height at nearly an inch per week. Not only is he greatly inconvenienced because he can't reach high shelves, he is also losing his power and significance as a man and a human being and reduced to merely survival. It’s an adventure tale, and it has some horror and sci-fi elements. I like how the story didn’t feel dated, despite being written in the 50’s. Scott Carey was not always a likable character, but he was believable and I felt his anguish over every inch he lost and the changing relationship with his wife and daughter, his encounter with bullies, a child molester, and a predatory black widow spider. The ending is sad and surprisingly hopeful. I enjoyed most of the other stories in this collection. Among my favorites were: The Test - a story that explores how society deals with its aging population and one family’s moral quandary and emotional turmoil over an aging parent who must be tested to determine if he is fit to live. Sad, heartbreaking, and not entirely unrealistic. Mantage was about a writer who, after watching a movie with his wife, wishes he could fast-forward through the drudgery and struggles of his life in order to achieve success faster. Shoofly was about the battle between a harried businessman and the fly that lands in his office. There was so much tension in this story that I wasn’t sure who or what would die at the end. The ending was hilarious!Highly recommended.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33549.The_Shrinking_Man
The Star Beast;Robert A. Heinlein;1954;1950;253;3.81;7757;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Aliens'];Lummox had been the Stuart family pet for years. Though far from cuddly and rather large, it had always been obedient and docile. Except, that is, for the time it had eaten the secondhand Buick . . .But now, all of a sudden and without explanation, Lummox had begun chomping down on a variety of things—not least, a very mean dog and a cage of virtually indestructible steel. Incredible!John Thomas and Lummox were soon in awfully hot water, and they didn't know how to get out. And neither one really understood just how bad things were—or how bad the situation could get—until some space voyagers appeared and turned a far-from-ordinary family problem into an extraordinary confrontation.;Despite its juvenile status, I’m glad I didn’t read this novel as a child. It’s not that there’s anything in it that is particularly objectionable to children, I just really don’t think I would have appreciated it in the slightest. From the basic plot description, one could easily think this was a classic boy and his dog (though replace dog with star beast) style story, filled with heart warming moments of separation, reunion and everyone learning a valuable lesson… and indeed these aspects are a part of the story, but they are far from the whole. While the plot description makes it sound as if the boy and the star beast are the main characters, they share only about half the plot with two government officials who have to make constant calls over the legality of the boy owning an alien, whether the alien could be classified as a “human” race and whether or not the beast has rights. These colder “logical” moments are as much the heart of the story as the emotional aspects between the boy and his pet. I’m not sure kid me would not have appreciated this deeper narrative. Nor would I have likely appreciated the 30 page trial section, with its legal terms and lengthy discussion on rights… though as an adult I found this to be one of the more interesting sections and fairly comical.This is a story filled with moral shades of gray. Kiku and Greenberg (our two government bureaucrats) make decisions that are often questionable from a moral standpoint, but looking at a bigger picture it makes sense. This at times seems like Heinlein’s politics start showing through, but unlike some of his later work, they don’t subtract from the story. Here it feels appropriate and adds a sense of desperation, showing that this situation is much bigger than anyone thought at the start and the implication of the final decision from earth’s standpoint could change everything drastically. This is one of those situations where I really can’t expand upon this without going into spoiler territory, but let us just say that the presentation of a boy’s adventures with his pet are… very minimal in the grand scheme of things. While I appreciated this more thoughtful and more serious tone, it does make the novel feel unbalanced. The opening 20 or so pages feel like a parody of the giant monster films so popular during the 50s, then it goes into a rather comical trial, before becoming a brief adventure story, then something of an intrigue tale. It all makes sense in the context of the story, but it has a hard time balancing all these different tones and styles (some of which are far more successful than others). All in all, I don’t want to complain too much though as I found myself enjoying the story as a whole. There are many flaws, though it contains very few of my usual issues with Heinlein. Overall a satisfying read if you’re looking for a classic science fiction that doesn’t require too deep of thought.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175328.The_Star_Beast

This light-hearted tale has some of Heinlein’s sassiest dialogue (not to mention the famous Flat Cats incident!). Oddly enough, it’s also a true example of real family values–for when you’re a Stone, your family is your highest priority.";*** 2023 reread - Heinlein doling out some kitschy retro SF like a boss.Because he was the Boss. The notorious RAH.While Castor and Pollux are the central picaresque protagonists, Hazel Stone - again - steals the show.

Hazel was a peach.The Stone family from Luna packs up the family rocket and sets sail for adventure out past Mars. Good fun.*** 2019 Re-readI first read this pre-GR and my memory of it was such that I never wrote a proper review.Now that I have refreshed my memory, I've bumped it up to four stars and count this as one of his best.First of all, it’s one of the juvenile books first published by Scribner’s ( this one in 1952 and so the sixth in the series) and so is good classic SF. Enough science to count and more than enough RAH storytelling to make this extra worthwhile.This features a show stealing Hazel Stone, one of Heinlein’s most enduring and intriguing characters. Hazel was the red headed imp in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and this describes her decades later as a free spirited matriarch of the Stone family. Hazel makes reference to Stranger in a Strange Land in context of Mars, nine years before that publication.Also noteworthy are the red headed twins Castor and Pollux. Genius troublemakers, erstwhile trickster gods, I wonder if they were an inspiration for the Weasley twins, Fred and George? Both sets are mischievous, mercantile and capable.Finally, this is simply classic Heinlein. A ubiquitous theme in his canon is the loud, boisterous, adventurous family and the Stones setting out from Luna to explore Mars and the asteroid belt is too good to miss.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50848.The_Rolling_Stones
Mission of Gravity;Hal Clement;1954;1950;174;3.9;7378;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Aliens', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Adventure'];Mesklin is a vast, inhospitable, disc-shaped planet, so cold that its oceans are liquid methane and its snows are frozen ammonia. It is a world spinning dizzyingly, a world where gravity can be a crushing 700 times greater than Earth's, a world too hostile for human explorers. But the planet holds secrets of inestimable value, and an unmanned probe that has crashed close to one of its poles must be recovered. Only the Mesklinites, the small creatures so bizarrely adapted to their harsh environment, can help.And so Barlennan, the resourceful and courageous captain of the Mesklinite ship Bree, sets out on an heroic and appalling journey into the terrible unknown. For him and his people, the prize to be gained is as great as that for mankind...Hal Clement's MISSION OF GRAVITY is universally regarded as one of the most important and best loved novels in the genre. The remarkable and sympathetic depiction of an alien species and the plausible and scientifically based realisation of the strange world they inhabit make it a major landmark in the history of hard SF.;"This is one of those novels that I must firmly place in the ""Interesting idea"" category without having it really grace the realm of ""great story"".Indeed, I loved the way that Hal Clement literally built a world from scratch, not merely creating 15 inch long aliens, but making a damn interesting planet that had different pulls of gravity depending on how close you were to the poles versus the equator, because the whole planet was flattened, was roughly 5k times the mass of earth, and the surface pull of gravity meant that we measly humans needed very heavy augmentation just to visit or we'd be crushed.Even the author sent out a call in the afterword, which to my opinion was even better than the main tale, to anyone out there to use his creation as they see fit and improve the math or write in the setting, and I appreciate that, because I keep wondering how much better it might have been if we had spent all our time in the heads of the humans rather than the aliens. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the attempt, but I did get rather bored with all the haggling and trading and industrial espionage that revolved around techs that could handle so much gravity or the gradual and immense differences between the equator and the pole during the travels. Like I said, it was very cool in concept.That being said, I kinda wish that all the awesome nuts and bolts of the world had been introduced or interspersed throughout the novel, from the human's point of view, so as to awe me in the context other than the density of the lifeforms or the fear of flying (or falling) and what might result with a splat of 300 gravities. :)It was fun for what it was, and it does rather show that it was written back in '53, but the focus on making sure there was good science (as far as Hal, himself, could manage it,) was both admirable and ambitious, so that's where I'm placing all my stars. :)";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/525285.Mission_of_Gravity

Methuselah's Children and Orphans of the Sky by Robert A. Heinlein are two examples and Poul Anderson’s Tau Zero is a similar variation. Writers as heralded as Clifford Simak, Robert Silverberg and John Brunner have all tried their hands at this theme and have done good work.Disney and Pixar fans might also consider the 2008 film Wall-E.Ultimately, if you boil this down to it’s most fundamental roots, all these tales stem from William Golding’s brilliant novel Lord of the Flies” and his brutal description of how fragile is the thin veil of our civilization; and Aldiss’ writing is first rate.

There is only one solution: He must accept an ancient and unforgivable heresy--and risk the futures of both worlds . . .";"This review contains spoilers for several of James Blish's novelsI discovered James Blish when I was about 10 (I believe the first one I read was The Star Dwellers), and I have returned to him many times throughout my life. I don't think I know any author who is quite as frustrating an example of Kilgore Trout syndrome. Wonderful ideas, but in most cases terrible execution: for every novel or short story that succeeds, at least three are left butchered and bleeding by the side of the road. Blish had a clutch of fascinatingly heretical theories about the relationship between Man and the Divine, and if he'd been able to write properly you sometimes feel he could have been another Dante or Nietzsche. In Black Easter, a surprisingly good novel about black magic, an insane arms dealer joins forces with a sorcerer to release all the major demons from Hell for one night; the book's terrifying conclusion has Satan appearing in person to announce the death of God. The sequel has another fine idea, but it's ruined by hasty and shoddy writing: it turns out that this is also part of the Divine Plan, and the Devil is unwillingly forced to take God's place. In his longest work, the four-volume Cities in Flight, Blish developed an even more grandiose and imaginative concept. The first volume depicts the Second Coming of Christ, and the concept is once again excellent. Christ confounds the expectations of the world's faithful by incarnating as Bliss Wagoner, the U.S. Senator for Alaska (this was well before Sarah Palin was born, in case you're wondering). He delivers on His promise to give eternal life in the heavens to His people, but does so in an unexpected way, by diverting federal funding into research programs which result in faster than light travel and an immortality drug. One of the most agreeable conceits of the novel is that Christ is not recognized by anyone, and is never explicitly identified; it's only when you get to the book's final sentence that Blish comes clean, and even then he phrases it cryptically. Alas, this brilliant idea is again spoiled by poor writing. And the same goes for the fourth volume: despite coming up with one of the best end-of-the-universe plots ever devised, in which the meaning of God's Creation is triumphantly revealed on the last page, the greater part of the book is boring and flat.So it should be no surprise that A Case of Conscience is more of the same. We have discovered a planet peopled by an apparently gentle and civilized race, the Lithians, who are gradually revealed as being literally a creation of the Devil, intended to delude and ensnare humanity. The protagonist, a Jesuit priest, too late recognizes the Lithian ambassador to Earth for what he is, and is powerless to oppose him; this scenario, it occurs to me now, is rather like that in Black Easter. And then, after what everyone here agrees is a fantastic buildup, the whole book falls apart, leaving the reader frustrated over yet another disappointment. It's genuinely tragic.Poor Blish always seems to have been in a hurry; except in a few short stories, and perhaps in Black Easter, he never had time to sit down and get it right. And he died quite young, at the age of only 54. He's probably been sentenced to a few thousand years in Purgatory for all those spectacular missed opportunities. But when he finally gets to Heaven, I expect he'll have figured out how to stop doing it and he'll be able to settle down to his long-term job as one of God's favorite jesters. It's clearly what he was meant for.____________________________________I just looked up Blish on Wikipedia and discovered that he's buried near Kenneth Grahame, author of The Wind in the Willows. I hope they are now collaborating on a joint project, though I must admit I'm having trouble imagining what it would look like...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123673.A_Case_of_Conscience
The Black Cloud;Fred Hoyle;1957;1950;200;3.9;4713;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'British Literature'];A 1959 classic 'hard' science-fiction novel by renowned Cambridge astronomer and cosmologist Fred Hoyle. Tracks the progress of a giant black cloud that comes towards Earth and sits in front of the sun, causing widespread panic and death. A select group of scientists and astronomers—including the dignified Astronomer Royal, the pipe smoking Dr Marlowe and the maverick, eccentric Professor Kingsly—engage in a mad race to understand and communicate with the cloud, battling against trigger happy politicians.;"This is the best geek wish-fulfillment fantasy I know, and I've also heard that it's Richard Dawkins's favorite science fiction novel. Make of that what you will. It's The Future, as imagined in the late 50s, and by the time I read it the book was already feeling a bit dated. But, oddly enough, that only adds to its charm. Scientists discover a huge cloud of gas, heading directly for the solar system. When it arrives, it will blot out the Sun for months, creating the greatest natural catastrophe since the meteorite impact that killed the dinosaurs. Hoyle, as one would expect, gets all the details right; this is his home territory. I love the bit where they write a program to calculate the Cloud's position based on the gravitational effect it has on the orbits of the outer planets. Apparently, in this version of The Future, they haven't even invented Assembler yet, much less FORTRAN. As the Cloud gets closer, all sorts of interesting and unexpected things happen. I'm afraid I can't say any more without dropping major spoilers, but it's both imaginative and scientifically plausible. This is a classy disaster novel.The disaster scenario is great, but the reason geeks love it so much is the main character. Kingsley is an absurdly idealized version of the author; brilliant astrophysicist, all-round polymath (he has great taste in classical music and reads Herodotus on the train), irresistible to women. If your partner is a geek with cultural pretensions and he hasn't come across The Black Cloud, get him a copy for his birthday. Then look him in the eyes and tell him you bought it because Kingsley reminded you so much of him. Trust me, this will pay off bigtime._________________________________________Kragh's Cosmology and Controversy throws interesting light on this book. One reason Dawkins might have for liking it is that Hoyle was even more rabidly anti-religious than he is. And Hoyle sneaks in some propaganda for his favorite theory here too. The super-intelligent Cloud, in response to a question about how the first Cloud-creature came about, says in oracular fashion that there never was a ""first"" Cloud. The scientists, apparently Steady-Staters to a man, look at each other and nod knowingly: that's one in the eye for the Big Bang people!_________________________________________Hoyle's autobiography, Home is Where the Wind Blows, contains many anecdotes I had never seen before. Here is one of the more startling ones:One day, Wolfgang Pauli asked my wife and me to have lunch with him and his wife. ""Ah ha!"" he cackled, ""I have just read your novel The Black Cloud. I thought it much better than your astronomical work."" Pauli told me that he had studied The Black Cloud in some detail, together with the psychologist Jung, and, indeed, that Jung had written a critical essay on it. I didn't have the temerity to explain that I thought I was only writing a story.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1246118.The_Black_Cloud
The Big Time;Fritz Leiber;1958;1950;128;3.23;4225;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Hugo Awards', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy'];"Have you ever worried about your memory, because it doesn't seem to recall exactly the same past from one day to the next? Have you ever thought that the whole universe might be a crazy, mixed-up dream? If you have, then you've had hints of the Change War.It's been going on for a billion years and it will last another billion or so. Up and down the timeline, the two sides--""Spiders"" and ""Snakes""--battle endlessly to change the future and the past. Our lives, our memories, are their battleground. And in the midst of the war is the Place, outside space and time, where Greta Forzane and the other Entertainers provide solace and r-&-r for tired time warriors.";"Hugo Award winner The Big Time (1958) is not only an enjoyable and memorable novel, but a disturbing one too. It was born, in part, from Fritz Leiber’s conception of time travel and the nature of the past. He did not believe at all in “The Butterfly Effect”; no, he believed that the past was more determined, more resilient. If you really wanted to change the future, Lieber thought, you would have to go back...again, and again, and again.During “The Change War”, two groups of fighters—directed by shadowy leaders known as the “Spiders” (the West) and the “Snakes” (the East)—fight battles and conduct clandestine operations, both in the future in the past, in order to alter history in their favor. Our novel takes place in a Recuperation Station, where our narrator Greta works as an “entertainer”--sort of a sex worker/nurse/PTSD therapist—whose job is to get the traumatized soldiers back in shape and ready to return to the front.It reminded me at first of a WW I play (soldiers on leave, amiably feuding, surrounded by mademoiselles), plus a typical Hollywood WW II movie (a tense situation that demands unity, with every possible ethnic group of G.I. represented). Except, in this case, the soldiers range from WWII G.I., Nazi commandant, and WWI British Tommy to a Roman Centurian, a Lunan in octopoid form, and an Amazon from ancient Crete. But, just as everybody seems to be having a good time, somebody sets the suitcase nuke a-ticking, and the Recuperation Station crew must solve their own locked room mystery to survive.This is a surprising, inventive novel, full with sharp, witty dialogue packed with multilingual puns and literary allusions. But it has a serious side too. As we learn of the many changes the “Change War” has wrought on time—including a centuries long Nazi takeover of America and the destruction of the works of Plato—we began to sense the great waste and even greater damage the Spiders and Snakes have wrought.As Bruce, the WWI Tommy, puts it:
Have you ever asked yourself how many operations the fabric of history can stand before its all stitches, whether too much Change won’t one day wear out the past. And the present and the future too, the whole bleeding business...Every operation leaves reality a bit cruder, a bit uglier, a bit more makeshift, and a whole lot less rich in those details and feelings that are our heritage, like the crude penciled sketch on canvas when you have stripped off the paint?
Sure, what Bruce says has a particular meaning about the “The Change War.” But it also has something tell us about any kind other kind of war too.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102281.The_Big_Time
Dune;Frank Herbert;1965;1960;658;4.28;1440314;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Novels'];Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for...When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream.;"In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an ""effort at prediction"". Dune had me hooked!First impressionThe very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad'Dib. It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword""To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration."" The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.Why Frank Herbert is a geniusThe setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.Plot and SettingDune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind"". Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit, an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach, a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is Melange, a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild, the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always. There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen, whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul Muad’Dib, however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach, something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen, the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? ThemesIn this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare.Real lifeNow these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis- It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.Why do good books get over?I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune
Slaughterhouse-Five;Kurt Vonnegut Jr.;1969;1960;275;4.1;1392666;yes;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'War', 'Literature', 'Novels'];Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it.  Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.;I have to admit to being somewhat baffled by the acclaim Slaughterhouse-5 has received over the years. Sure, the story is interesting. It has a fascinating and mostly successful blend of tragedy and comic relief. And yes, I guess the fractured structure and time-travelling element must have been quite novel and original back in the day. But that doesn't excuse the book's flaws, of which there are a great many in my (seemingly unconventional) opinion. Take, for instance, Vonnegut's endless repetition of the phrase 'So it goes.' Wikipedia informs me it crops up 106 times in the book. It felt like three hundred times to me. About forty pages into the book, I was so fed up with the words 'So it goes' that I felt like hurling the book across the room, something I have not done since trying to read up on French semiotics back in the 1990s. I got used to coming across the words every two pages or so eventually, but I never grew to like them. God, no. I found some other nits to pick, too. Some of them were small and trivial and frankly rather ridiculous, such as -- wait for it -- the hyphen in the book's title. Seriously, what is that hyphen doing there? There's no need for a hyphen there. Couldn't someone have removed it, like, 437 editions ago? And while I'm at it, couldn't some discerning editor have done something about the monotonous quality of Vonnegut's prose -- about the interminable repetition of short subject-verb-object sentences? Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all authors should use Henry James- or Claire Messud-length sentences. Heaven forbid. I'm actually rather fond of minimalism, both in visual art and in writing. But Vonnegut's prose is so sparse and simplistic it's monotonous rather than minimalist, to the point where I frequently found myself wishing for a run-on sentence every now and then, or for an actual in-depth description of something. I hardly ever got either. As a result, there were times when I felt like I was reading a bare-bones outline of a story rather than the story itself. Granted, it was an interesting outline, larded with pleasing ideas and observations, but still, I think the story could have been told in a more effective way. A less annoying way, too.As for the plot, I liked it. I liked the little vignettes Vonnegut came up with and the colourful characters he created (the British officers being my particular favourites). I liked the fact that you're never quite sure whether Billy is suffering from dementia, brain damage or some kind of delayed post-traumatic stress disorder, or whether there is some actual time-travelling going on. I even liked the jarring switches in perspective, although I think they could have been handled in a slightly more subtle manner. And I liked the book's anti-war message, weak and defeatist though it seemed to be. In short, I liked the book, but it took some doing. I hope I'll be less annoyed by the two other Vonnegut books I have sitting on my shelves, Breakfast of Champions and Cat's Cradle.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4981.Slaughterhouse_Five
A Clockwork Orange;Anthony Burgess;1962;1960;240;4.0;726202;no;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Horror', 'Literature', 'Novels'];In Anthony Burgess's influential nightmare vision of the future, criminals take over after dark. Teen gang leader Alex narrates in fantastically inventive slang that echoes the violent intensity of youth rebelling against society. Dazzling and transgressive, A Clockwork Orange is a frightening fable about good and evil and the meaning of human freedom. This edition includes the controversial last chapter not published in the first edition, and Burgess’s introduction, “A Clockwork Orange Resucked.”;"How to review an infamous book about which so much has already been said? By avoiding reading others’ thoughts until I’ve written mine.There are horrors in this book, but there is beauty too, and so much to think about. The ends of the book justify the means of its execution, even if the same is not true of what happens in the story.Book vs Film, and Omission of Final ChapterI saw the film first, and read the book shortly afterwards. Usually a bad idea, but in this case, being familiar with the plot and the Nadsat slang made it easier to relax (if that's an appropriate word, given some of the horrors to come) into the book. The film is less hypnotic and far more shocking than the book, because it is more visual and because, like the US version of the book, it omits the more optimistic final chapter.The British censors originally passed the film - uncut. But a year later, it was cited as possibly inspiring a couple of murders, leading to threats against Kubrick's family. The year after that, Kubrick asked for it to be withdrawn, and it was, even though he said""To try and fasten any responsibility on art as the cause of life seems to me to put the case the wrong way around.""See Withdrawl of film from UK screensandOmission of final chapterPlot and StructureIt is a short novel, comprising three sections of seven chapters, told by “your humble narrator”, Alex. In the first section, Alex and his teenage gang indulge in “ultra-violence” (including sexual assault of young girls); in the middle section, Alex is in prison and then undergoes a horrific new treatment (a sort of aversion therapy); the final section follows him back in the real world, rejected by his parents, now the puppet of opposing political factions. The whole thing is set in a slightly dystopian, very near future and explores issues of original sin, punishment and revenge, free will, and the nature of evil.One awful incident involves breaking in to a writer’s house and gang raping his wife, who later dies. A similar incident happened to Burgess’ first wife (though he wasn’t there at the time). Writing a fictionalised account from the point of view of the perpetrator is extraordinary: charitable, cathartic, or a more complex mixture?ThemesWhy is Alex as he is? “What I do I do because I like to do”, and perhaps there is no more that can be said. As Alex ponders, “this biting of their toe-nails over what is the CAUSE of badness is what turns me into a fine laughing malchick. They don’t go into the cause of GOODNESS… badness is of the self… and that self is made by old Bog or God and is his great pride and radosty”.Can people like Alex be cured, and if so, how?Imprisonment, police brutality, fire and brimstone don’t work. Enter the Ludovico Technique, whereby Alex is injected with emetics before being strapped, with his eyelids held open, to watch videos of extreme physical and sexual violence. He becomes conditioned to be unable to commit such acts, or even to watch or think about them. This raises more questions than it solves. The prison governor prefers the old “eye for an eye”, but has to give in to the new idea of making bad people good. “The question is whether such a technique can really make a man good. Goodness comes from within… Goodness is something chosen. When a man cannot choose he ceases to be a man.” The chaplain has doubts, too, “Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?” On the other hand, by consenting to the treatment, Alex is, in an indirect way, choosing to be good.The technique (or torture) is promoted as making Alex “sane” and “healthy” so that he can be “a free man”, but although he is released from prison, he remains imprisoned by the power of the technique, even to the extent that the music he loves now makes him sick (because it was playing in the background) and his inability to defend himself means he becomes a victim.Do the ends justify the means?Dr Brodsky thinks so: “We are not concerned with motive, with the higher ethics. We are only concerned with cutting down crime.” However, if it wears off, it will all have been for nothing.Redemption?The possibility of redemption is a common thread, reaching its peak in this final chapter. Burgess was raised as a Catholic, educated in Catholic schools, but lost his faith aged sixteen. He continued to have profound interest in religious ideas, though, as explained here. The final chapter (omitted from US editions of the book until 1986, and also the film) feels incongruously optimistic in some ways, but by suggesting the true answer as to what will cure delinquency is… maturity, it might be thought the most pessimistic chapter. Is teen violence an inevitable cycle: something people grow into, and then out of when they start to see their place in the bigger picture? And if so, is that acceptable to society? Language - Nadsat SlangA distinctive feature of the book is the Nadsat slang that Alex and his droogs use (“nadsat” is the Russian suffix for “teen” – see here). Burgess invented it from Russian with a bit of Cockney rhyming slang and Malay, because real teen slang is so ephemeral, the book would quickly seem dated otherwise. He wanted the book published without a glossary, and it is written so carefully, that the meaning is usually clear, and becomes progressively so, as you become accustomed to it: “a bottle of beer frothing its gulliver off and a horrorshow rookerful of like plum cake” and “There’s only one veshch I require… having my malenky bit of fun with real droogs”. Where an English word is used literally and metaphorically, the Nadsat one is too; for example, “viddy” is used to see with one’s eyes and to understand someone’s point. The skill of carefully used context makes Russian-based Nadsat much easier to follow than the dialect of Riddley Walker (see my review HERE), even though the latter is based on mishearings of English. (To be fair, the whole of Riddley Walker is written in dialect, whereas in Clockwork Orange, it's conventional English with a generous smattering of slang.)Where the meaning isn't immediately obvious or is merely vague, you go with the flow until it seeps into your consciousness (much as would happen if you were dropped into an environment where you had no language in common with anyone else). It's another way of sucking the reader into Alex's world and his gang. Nadsat lends a mesmerising and poetic aspect to the text that is in sharp contrast to the revulsion invoked by some of the things Alex does: tolchocking a starry veck doesn’t sound nearly as bad as beating an old man into a pulp - Nadsat acts as a protective veil. In the film, this effect is somewhat diluted because you SEE these acts.The book was like published in 1962 and Alex frequently uses “like” as an interjection as I did earlier in this sentence – something that has become quite a common feature of youth speak in recent times. What happened in between, I wonder?Other than that, much of what Alex says has echoes of Shakespeare and the King James Bible: “Come, gloopy bastard thou art. Think thou not on them” and “If fear thou hast in thy heart, o brother, pray banish it forthwith” and “Fear not. He canst taketh care of himself, verily”. There is always the painful contrast of beautiful language describing unpleasant and horrific things.Similarly, the repetition of a few phrases is almost liturgical. Alex addresses his readers as “oh my brothers”, which is unsettling: if I’m one of his brothers, am I in some way complicit, or at least condoning, what he does? Another recurring phrase is, “What’s it going to be then, eh?” It is the opening phrase of each section and used several times in the first chapter of each section.MusicBurgess was a composer, as well as a writer, and Alex has a passion for classical music, especially “Ludwig van”. This may be partly a ploy to make the book more ageless than if he loved, for example, Buddy Holly, but more importantly, it’s another way of creating dissonance: a deep appreciation of great art is not “supposed” to coexist with mindless delinquency. Alex has lots of small speakers around his room, so “I was like netted and meshed in the orchestra”, and the music is his deepest joy: “Oh bliss, bliss and heaven. I lay all nagoy to the ceiling… sloshing the sluice of lovely sounds. Oh it was gorgeousness and gorgeosity made flesh.” The treatment destroys this pleasure- with dramatic results.Horror and Beauty, Sympathy for a VillainUltimately, I think Alex is sympathetic villain: he has a seductive exuberance and charm and although he does horrific things, when awful things are done to him, sympathy flows. Yes, there are horrors in this book, but there is beauty too, and so much to think about. The ends of the book justify the means of its execution, even if the same is not true of what happens in the story.

Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?;Philip K. Dick;1968;1960;258;4.09;465072;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Cyberpunk', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Classics'];"It was January 2021, and Rick Deckard had a license to kill. Somewhere among the hordes of humans out there, lurked several rogue androids. Deckard's assignment--find them and then...""retire"" them. Trouble was, the androids all looked exactly like humans, and they didn't want to be found!";"I could say that I love Dick, but that would be weird. I do very much enjoy Philip K. Dick's writing and though this is not one of his best, the ""Pizza and Sex Rule"" applies to him; ie. just as even bad pizza and / or sex is still pretty good, bad PKD is as well. And this is not bad at all. The first mistake that a new reader would make is to watch Blade Runner and expect a novelization of that film; it was LOOSELY based upon the book. I'm a big fan of the Ridley Scott film starring Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer, but the movie diverged from Phillip K. Dick's literature early on. The book is far more bleak than the film, if you can believe that, and much more intricate and complicated. Blade Runner benefits from a simplified storyline. The author was far ahead of his time both in the complexity of his story and the perspective from which he writes. There are elements of Brave New World, I, Robot, and Dune; but the author has a unique voice and the story is an original. It is not an excellent work, as there are gaps and inconsistencies and many loose ends that are never tied in, but the concept and provocation are superb.One element of the book that was completely left out of the film was a sub-plot involving a Christ-like messiah and a faith system based upon what could have been a hoax. First published in 1968, this was one of his more theological based novels, and a trend that would continue steadily becoming more frequent and invasive until the end of his writing.A MUST read for PKD fans as well as SF/F fans period.*** 2020 Reread:One thing I love about PKD writing is the accessibility. He discusses complex, sophisticated issues, but he never is. There’s a blue-collar element to him that is ubiquitous across his canon. He grew up working low level retail and repair shop jobs and it never left him.Another element of this book that I picked up on more this time was the empathy religion set up around Wilbur Mercer. When I read this before, I thought of it as kind of a weird sub-plot but this is a fundamental part of Dick’s vision. Humans who feel empathy with the Christ-like Mercer are separate from the androids who do not feel empathy? Or do they? PKD is too much of an artist to make this simple, his world building is a rich tapestry of detail and nuance.Along with Mercerism is the attraction with caring for animals, real animals if possible (in the post-war diseased world) but electric animals if need be. This relationship with animal husbandry is tied together with the distinctions between humans and androids, naturally biological and created.A great SF novel.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36402034-do-androids-dream-of-electric-sheep
Cat’s Cradle;Kurt Vonnegut Jr.;1963;1960;306;4.15;411129;no;['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction', 'Humor', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Dystopia'];Told with deadpan humour and bitter irony, Kurt Vonnegut's cult tale of global destruction preys on our deepest fears of witnessing Armageddon and, worse still, surviving it ...Dr Felix Hoenikker, one of the founding 'fathers' of the atomic bomb, has left a deadly legacy to the world. For he's the inventor of 'ice-nine', a lethal chemical capable of freezing the entire planet. The search for its whereabouts leads to Hoenikker's three ecentric children, to a crazed dictator in the Caribbean, to madness. Felix Hoenikker's Death Wish comes true when his last, fatal gift to humankind brings about the end, that for all of us, is nigh...;"Most people have read Cat's Cradle, so I won't bother to try and hide spoilers. Did you say you hadn't read it? Well, what are you waiting for? This isn't Ulysses, you know, it's short and funny! So, now that it's just us people who know the book, I want to say why I disagree with the criticism you often see, that it's too fragmentary. On the contrary, I think it's very focused, and makes its point with near-perfect economy and wit. There are two obvious themes. One is how the irresponsible use of science to construct ever more deadly weapons is probably going to end up destroying the whole world. The other is a wonderfully crazy take on religion. Each of these themes is satisfying in its own right; what's less clear is that they have anything to do with each other. Let's look at the first theme. Vonnegut's scarily plausible thesis is that it won't be a question of some madman destroying the world on purpose. I love General Jack T. Ripper in Doctor Strangelove, the obvious movie parallel to this book, but I find him somehow less convincing than the series of deranged, helplessly incompetent people in Cat's Cradle. Felix Hoenikker, an obvious Asperger's type, invents Ice-9 in response to a casual question from the US military. His three damaged children get hold of the secret, and exploit it for their own petty ends. Plain, charmless Angela sells it to the Americans in exchange for a playboy husband; Newt, the midget, gives it to the Soviets for a dirty weekend on Cape Cod with a tiny Russian dancer; and, fatally, humorless Franklin sells it to ""Papa"" Monzano, who makes him a Major General in the largely imaginary army of San Lorenzo, a bankrupt state, I believe, loosely based on Haiti and the Dominican Republic. After that, things just proceed by themselves; nothing works in San Lorenzo, so why would you be able to successfully guard a doomsday device? And, sure enough, it gets used completely by accident.The second theme is presented through Bokononism, a kind of Caribbean version of Christianity, and surely the best fictional religion ever devised. Is there any person here who's never tried boku maru? (Unfortunately, in real life it doesn't have the effect described in the book. Pity). Bokononism is the one thing that makes life worthwhile for Papa's miserable subjects. Officially, the religion is outlawed; in practice, everyone is a Bokononist, which makes their lives rich and meaningful. Everything about the religion turns out to be a lie, and there is even a technical term, foma, for the lies that make up its substance. None the less, Vonnegut succeeds admirably in showing what a good religion it is. The scene where Dr. Schlichter von Koenigswald reads the Bokonist last rites to the dying Papa Monzano is funny, but also moving. I love the line ""Nice going, God!"", which expresses that particular sentiment with unusual clarity and feeling; it's extremely respectful, while pretending to be the exact opposite.So, what is the connection between the two themes? I think in fact that Vonnegut tells you straight out, but since he does it at the beginning (a favorite ruse of crime writers), you don't quite notice it. He introduces Bokononism, and recounts its creation myth, which is absurd even by the standards of this magic realist genre. Then he cheerfully tells you that Bokonon himself admits that it's all lies. Finally, he comments, in one of his better-known quotes: ""Anyone unable to understand how a useful religion can be founded on lies will not understand this book either"". As already noted, Bokonon's wise lies in fact make an excellent religion.Here's what I think he means by this. The potential destruction of all life on Earth isn't a very amusing subject. It's so horrifying that you can hardly think about it at all. But Vonnegut manages to present most of the book as a comedy, so that you are able to think about it, which we desperately need to do before it's all too late. By making it funny, he is formally lying to us, but these lies are more useful to us than the truth; we're in pretty much the same situation as the San Lorenzans, who couldn't survive without their mendacious religion. People during the Cold War were, with good reason, scared shitless that the world was going to end soon in a nuclear holocaust. We came terrifyingly close during the Cuba Missile Crisis. (As Christopher Hitchens says, do you remember where you were the day JFK nearly killed all of us?) There were many books and movies intended to help people relate to what was going on. Some of them just presented the threat straight up, in as realistic a way as they could manage: the version I like most is Shute's On the Beach. But I would say that the mirror-reversed ones, like Cat's Cradle and Doctor Strangelove, were better. It's amazing how powerful a weapon humor is; I feel they did more to help persuade us not to blow ourselves up. We need these people badly if we're going to stay sane. Can someone point me to a new Vonnegut, who knows how to make us laugh at global warming and the financial meltdown? I'd rather like to read him.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle
Dune Messiah;Frank Herbert;1969;1960;336;3.89;326969;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera'];Book Two in the Magnificent Dune Chronicles--the Bestselling Science Fiction Adventure of All TimeDune Messiah continues the story of Paul Atreides, better known--and feared--as the man christened Muad'Dib. As Emperor of the Known Universe, he possesses more power than a single man was ever meant to wield. Worshipped as a religious icon by the fanatical Fremens, Paul faces the enmity of the political houses he displaced when he assumed the throne--and a conspiracy conducted within his own sphere of influence.And even as House Atreides begins to crumble around him from the machinations of his enemies, the true threat to Paul comes to his lover, Chani, and the unborn heir to his family's dynasty...Includes an introduction by Brian Herbert;Completely Different Tone Than Dune #1Dune #1 leaves us in a complete cliffhanger. However, Dune #2 starts up 12 years later. In the introduction to the version that I read, Brian Herbert (the author’s son) wrote that one magazine labeled this book as the “disappointment of the year.” However, he explained the book is supposed to show how absolute power can corrupt leaders including Paul Atreides. Dune Messiah has a completely different tone than Dune. Dune was filled with adventure and hope, the entire group working, willing to die, to transform the environment. Further, Dune had a bunch of very strong female characters. In contrast, Dune Messiah is more political and emotional. Also, the depiction of women is just horrible. Alia is boy crazy, and Irulan and Chani are only focused on Paul and producing an heir. In 12 years, Paul has matured. He is not the boy of Dune. He makes decisions almost cavalierly. The book was definitely entertaining though. The audiobook had an entire cast of characters, and it was such a rich experience. As with Dune, I could pick something up new each time reading Dune Messiah. However, the tone on this was much darker than Dune, and it wasn’t inspiring. The ending of Dune Messiah was so weak, the complete opposite of the ending of Dune.Recently, I was reading a list ranking all of the Dune books, and this one was rated the very worst of the series so I am still excited to continue with this series and hope that the future is a little less bleak. 2025 Reading ScheduleJan	A Town Like AliceFeb	BirdsongMar	Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr	War and PeaceMay	The Woman in WhiteJun	AtonementJul	The Shadow of the WindAug	Jude the ObscureSep	UlyssesOct	Vanity FairNov	A Fine BalanceDec	GerminalConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Insta My Bookstore at Pango;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44492285-dune-messiah
2001: A Space Odyssey;Arthur C. Clarke;1968;1960;297;4.17;319005;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy'];On the Moon, an enigma is uncovered.So great are the implications of this discovery that for the first time men are sent out deep into our solar system.But long before their destination is reached, things begin to go horribly, inexplicably wrong...One of the greatest-selling science fiction novels of our time, this classic book will grip you to the very end.;"The book is always better than the film, but I'd never read 2001 before. What I didn't know, until reading the foreword, is that this novel was literally written in tandem with the film, with Clarke and Kubrick feeding each other ideas. At some points, however, filming overtook writing, or vice versa, and the two stories, though similar, split along two different paths. After reading the book, the film becomes little more than a very well crafted container: It's pretty and neat to look at it, but open it up, and it's empty. There is none of Clarke's vision of how a being we'd call God would communicate with us across unfathomable time spans, or teach us, or lead us into higher consciousness. Stripped away by Kubrick is the sense that this being truly wants us to be in its image, and that the whole breadcrumb trail of monoliths was designed to do just that. And completely erased is the notion that David Bowman, as Star Child, is now one with the Universe, in some Zen-like way, and also much more like something we'd called a god.Don't get me wrong, 2001 is still one of my favorite films, but to get the full meaning and understand the full weight of why 2001 has been called ""the perfect science fiction story,"" you must read the book. Clarke marries science, mysticism, theory, and fantasy in ways like no other. Unfortunately, Kubrick stripped away the mysticism and theory and left us what is, in comparison to the book, only a glimmer at something bigger.Kubrick touched the monolith, but Clarke went inside.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70535.2001
Stranger in a Strange Land;Robert A. Heinlein;1961;1960;525;3.92;316122;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Novels'];NAME: Valentine Michael SmithANCESTRY: HumanORIGIN: MarsValentine Michael Smith is a human being raised on Mars, newly returned to Earth. Among his people for the first time, he struggles to understand the social mores and prejudices of human nature that are so alien to him, while teaching them his own fundamental beliefs in grokking, watersharing, and love.;"Apparently a classic of the sci-fi cannon, I'd never heard of this book until it came up on a book club here. It took me a long time to read only because of lack of time, and a rather annoying trait the author has that I'll go into later.This is one of those books that tells us more about the period it was written in than anything else, so it's important to note that it was first published in 1961 and later again in 1968 - when moon fever was running high and people seemed to have high expectations for human achievement. Events are set in an undisclosed future but the older characters seem to remember the first moon landing, so I wouldn't be surprised if Heinlein was thinking of it being set around about now. With a mix of very daggy technology like ""stereo tanks"" (TVs) and large, clumsy listening devices, alongside hover crafts and spaceships to Mars, the scope of the setting is hampered by a 50s' imagination. Stranger in a Strange Land is about Michael ""Mike"" Smith, the ""Man from Mars"", offspring of two of scientists on board the original mission to Mars, who was raised by Martians. He is more Martian than human, especially in his thinking and outlook and philosophy, when he is brought back to Earth. Heir to a shitload of money care of his parents' heritage, it's unsurprising that the bigshots on Earth are wanting to keep him locked up tight. A nurse at the hospital where he is first kept, Jill, offers him a glass of water and in that one action becomes a ""water brother"" - the highest accolade for Mike. She rescues him from the politicians with the help of her journalist friend Ben and takes him to the home of a grumpy, reclusive man, Dr Jubal Harshaw, who lives with three young women who serve as secretaries - Anne, Miriam and Dorcas - and two men who take care of the property - Duke and Larry. Mike's particular talents slowly reveal: he can vanish things, including people, if he recognises there is a ""wrongness"" in them; he can withdraw from his own body and shut down his body so there is no heartbeat; he can teleport and think telepathically; he can absorb books in minutes and regulate his own body, making it muscular and mature at will; and so on. All of this can be done with understanding of the Martian language, which Jill starts to learn. He's completely ignorant of human ways, of human concepts - things like jealousy, possessiveness etc. are all alien to him. He doesn't understand religions and he has never laughed.After months on the road with just Jill, learning and ""grokking"", he finally knows why humans laugh and how to do it himself, and gets the human condition. It leads him to start his own ""church"", though it's more of a way of life open to people of all religious denominations, with free love and open mindedness, and abilities gained through mastery of the Martian language. With Mike set up as a new Messiah, a prophet, there's only one logical conclusion for this story.As a story, Stranger in a Strange Land is enjoyable and original. Yet, as a story, it's also bogged down with sermons, with Heinlein's opinions, and a very out-of-date mentality. It reads very 60s and 70s, though it was written before then. Not as far-sighted as it would like to be! It's especially noticeable in the relations between men and women, which have that faintly liberated tinge that's all really lip service, and a great deal of sexist language. Which is ironic, really, considering Mike's free love cult. There's also an affectionate insult for a Muslim character who's nicknamed ""Stinky"" that I couldn't help but be offended by.It does make it hard to read, though, when you come across lines like this, as spoken by Jill very matter-of-factly: ""Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault."" (p304) While today the statistics are more like ""nine of ten times, a woman's rapist is someone she knows"", the idea that it's ""partly her fault"" is still considered true by way too many people. To hear this come out of Jill's mouth makes it especially awful.Another example is Jubal saying: ""Pipe down, Anne. Close your mouth, Dorcas. This is not a time when women have the vote."" (p382) Granted, they ignored him and did what they wanted anyway, but there're a lot of these flippant, dismissive remarks all through the book. Product of its times, sure: just not at all futuristic.Then we come to the proselytizing, which the book is rife with. Today, reading this book, the opinions shared are very ""yes, so?"" - old hat, in other words. Though it is fun to read the rants, the set-up is cringe-worthy. Jubal is the main lecturer, and the characters around him serve as props. There are a great many ""Huh?""s from educated and knowledgeable people so that Jubal can share his abundant wisdom. One ""huh?"" is okay, but when each long paragraph of Jubal is responded to with a ""huh?"" it gets a bit silly. Frankly, it's bad writing. It reminded me somewhat of The Da Vinci Code, which also uses characters to expound the author's theories on religion etc. at great length. While these things did at times make it harder to read the book, essentially the book is easy to read and often quite fun too. Jubal's sermons (and when Jubal isn't around, other characters fill the role, like Ben and Sam) can be a bit heavy-handed and obvious but a lot of it I agree with, so it wasn't rubbing me up the wrong way. Mike is a challenging character to write, because in order to write a naive, ignorant character to this extent, you need to be incredibly self-aware. Heinlein has fairly good success here, and Mike's growth, maturation, development and resolutions fit the character and work. He has charisma and is definitely intriguing; yet because he lacks the human flaws, he's also somewhat unapproachable and alien: a good balance to achieve.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/350.Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land

The Man in the High Castle;Philip K. Dick;1962;1960;259;3.6;217963;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Alternate History', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fantasy'];It's America in 1962. Slavery is legal once again. The few Jews who still survive hide under assumed names. In San Francisco, the I Ching is as common as the Yellow Pages. All because some twenty years earlier the United States lost a war — and is now occupied by Nazi Germany and Japan.This harrowing, Hugo Award-winning novel is the work that established Philip K. Dick as an innovator in science fiction while breaking the barrier between science fiction and the serious novel of ideas. In it Dick offers a haunting vision of history as a nightmare from which it may just be possible to wake.;"On Wednesday I found myself at a party (an occurrence itself worthy of remark) at which everyone wore ""I'm currently reading..."" stickers, so I had several opportunities to explain why I was loving The Man in the High Castle. One such conversation went like this:""So what's that about?""""Well, it's scifi. Or rather speculative fiction.""""Er, hm. No. I don't do scifi.""""But it's got Nazis!""""Oh my god I love Nazis!""Another conversation involved me explaining to a white guy how interesting I (a half-Japanese guy) found reading about defeated white Americans kowtowing to their Japanese overlords. The awkwardness of the words coming out of my mouth did not even occur to me for several sentences.I'm pretty sure at some point during the evening I also said, with party-speaking volume, ""I think I really like Dick!"" Sometimes I wish English had fewer homophones.Suffice it to say that I am swearing off parties and returning to my safe, almost-completely-awkwardness-free hermetic lifestyle.Ok, this book. Let me just establish that neither the Nazi-lover nor I are, in fact, Nazi-lovers or racists (or no more racist than the average person), and that despite (or perhaps because of?) the uncomfortable conversations this book might occasion, it's a great read! My former experience with Phillip K. Dick (whose first name and middle initial are considerably more important in conversation than heretofore imagined) was with a collection of his short stories, which was amusing but very much in the Atomic Age sort of a vein: THE BOMB, robots, space ships, THE BOMB, etc. After finding J.G. Ballard's similar ruminations on mortality and atomic annihilation to be unfinishably boring, I was wary of returning to PKD (ah, much better), and the premise of a world in which the Axis powers won WWII could definitely have lead down that road. Plucky American rebels fighting their Nazi oppressors and thwarting a plot to nuke New York while chronically hamstrung by their moribund contemplation of non-existence? No thanks. But this book is so not that book! As with other works by PKD (or at least the cinematic interpretations I've seen), the underlying horror is not about annihilation, but about anxiety over identity. In High Castle, the American identity has been completely crushed. There is no rebel faction, there are no competent or truly sympathetic American characters, and American cultural artifacts that *we* keep in museums are now collector's items to be pawned off to Japanese connoisseurs (not unlike the 19th century European obsession with Japonisme). The idea of infinite American ingenuity and resourcefulness has been discarded along with our belief in democracy. The Japanese are consistently depicted as high-handed, elitist, occasionally racist, but generally fair and benign in intent... much like American occupational forces in reconstruction Japan. So if we as Americans aren't rebels, if we're not democrats, if we're not plucky heroes with wild ideas so crazy they might actually work, who are we? What a great subject for a scifi novel.There's also quite a bit about the life and meaning of objects, or the ""historicity"" as the characters call it. Why is a penny touched by the President more significant than any other penny? I'm not entirely sure how this theme plays into the rest of the novel. It may have something to do with the arbitrariness invoked by the use of the I Ching by almost every character, i.e. the specific history of any given object is as intrinsically meaningful as a pattern of tossed sticks, and it is the evaluator's interpretation that has true significance. Again, though, how does it relate to Nazis?!Also, hawt book-in-book action! All the characters in this what-if book are reading their own what-if book postulating a world in which the Axis powers didn't win WWII. I mean, yo dawg, I herd you like speculative fiction, so we put a book in yo book so u can speculate while u speculate. It's kind of cool.The book's not perfect. Women get the short shrift. Betty Kasoura seems both intelligent and sympathetic to the plight of the Americans, but doesn't take action to the extent that her husband does. I'm not sure if Juliana's murder of the covert gestapo officer was due to self-defense so much as hysteria. Up until that point she was basically Don Draper's 1st season mental model of a woman, plus judo. Sign of the times (this was published in 1962) or a part of the narrative? Races and ethnicities are mercilessly stereotyped, but seemingly without bias: Japanese are polite and inscrutable, Americans are emotional and clumsy, Chinese are crude and servile, Germans orderly and maniacal. I suppose you could interpret that as the triumph of the Axis worldview over Western egalitarian principles, or you could read it as the biases inherent in our own 1960s America.Anyway, totally worth trying, even if you don't like scifi OR Nazis.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216363.The_Man_in_the_High_Castle
The Left Hand of Darkness;Ursula K. Le Guin;1969;1960;304;4.1;190704;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Queer'];A groundbreaking work of science fiction, The Left Hand of Darkness tells the story of a lone human emissary to Winter, an alien world whose inhabitants spend most of their time without a gender. His goal is to facilitate Winter's inclusion in a growing intergalactic civilization. But to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own views and those of the completely dissimilar culture that he encounters.Embracing the aspects of psychology, society, and human emotion on an alien world, The Left Hand of Darkness stands as a landmark achievement in the annals of intellectual science fiction.;"2023: still amazing. And still breaks my heart in the end.————2021: At this point it’s hard for me to even imagine that just a decade ago I was reading Ursula K. Le Guin for the first time. This book overwhelmed me with how good it was, and how different it ended up from what I expected. Le Guin’s measured and contemplative anthropological science fiction was so incredibly memorable in how it presents the world, challenges the assumptions and reaffirms essential humanity of all of us that it touched my very soul and probably changed something in me forever.This book needs to be read starting with its wonderful introduction, written by Le Guin herself. This part is so important, especially for those who from the advantage of society that has moved on after decades since the book came to be may view it as tame, as not going far enough, not being visionary in the way that calls to our wishes and current views. Let’s give the spotlight to Le Guin’s own words:
“This book is not extrapolative. If you like you can read it, and a lot of other science fiction, as a thought-experiment. […] The purpose of a thought-experiment, as the term was used by Schrödinger and other physicists, is not to predict the future—indeed Schrödinger’s most famous thought-experiment goes to show that the “future,” on the quantum level, cannot be predicted—but to describe reality, the present world. Science fiction is not predictive; it is descriptive.”
Le Guin described the world as viewed not from the Ekumenical year 1491 but from the Earth year 1969, and there are still elements that are painfully recognizable.But what I see, what gives me hope, is that essential humanity that triumphs over the smallness of prejudices and conventions. The humanity that Le Guin was so good at bringing to forefront.
“It is a terrible thing, this kindness that human beings do not lose. Terrible, because when we are finally naked in the dark and cold, it is all we have. We who are so rich, so full of strength, we end up with that small change. We have nothing else to give.”
Dream on, Therem Harth rem ir Estraven. Dream on, and I’ll dream on with you.
”Will you tell us about the other worlds out among the stars—the other kinds of men, the other lives?”
————————————2012: The question that permeates Le Guin's 1969 sensational for its time novel about the ambisexual society is what remains once the male and the female labels are stripped away? What is underneath the labels - is it simply humanity?
""A man wants his virility regarded, a woman wants her femininity appreciated, however indirect and subtle the indications of regard and appreciation. On Winter they will not exist. One is respected and judged only as a human being. It is an appalling experience.""
 

Like some readers, Genly Ai, the protagonist of this brilliantly written leisurely-paced cerebral sci-fi classic, for a while just cannot seem to move past the ambisexuality aspect. Ai is an ambassador to the planet Gethen to convince its leaders to join the interplanetary union Ekumen. The inhabitants of Gethen differ from other humanoid races in two aspects: (1) they have adapted well to tolerate the Ice Age climate of their world, and (2) they are ambisexual. For the majority of lunar cycle they are essentially neuter, and for several days they enter a sexual phase, kemmer, during which they attain either male or female characteristics and become capable of sex.
""What is a friend, in a world where any friend may be a lover at a new phase of the moon? Not I, locked in my virility: no friend to Therem Harth, or any other of his race. Neither man nor woman, neither and both, cyclic, lunar, metamorphosing under the hand's touch, changelings in the human cradle, they were no flesh of mine, no friends; no love between us.""
Ai, a male proud of his “virility”, does not feel comfortable among the Gethians. He is always suspicious, always mistrusting of these people whose essence he refuses to understand. He views himself as ""a stallion in harness with a mule"", chuckles at the idea of a pregnant King. He tries to view the Gethenians as male, and is appalled at all the femininity that he sees in them, feeling that it is wrong, inferior, alien to him. In the world of wholeness, not of duality, he feels lost and isolated without the familiar stark division that rules our lives. After all, the first question that people immediately ask at birth is - boy or girl? Man or woman? [Sidenote: Remember the whole relatively recent conundrum about Canadian parents who decided to raise their child without telling the society the child's gender? They received death threats for that attempt, so ingrained is the gender division among us].Ai is not a bad guy. He is just lost, confused, and isolated - a human, in the other words. He is so out of his comfort zone he does not comprehend how to deal with the society that he views as passive, where there is less competitiveness, and where crying is perfectly fine. He finds it so hard to accept this world without the quientesential 'maleness' or 'femininity' - even though he struggles to define exactly what it is that separates men from women. Ai becomes so terribly isolated in his alienness, longing for something familiar. In this strange and unfamiliar world of wholeness, he clings to the eternal human ""Us vs. Them"" divide, refusing in his loneliness and fear to look beyond the usual, the prejudice. Until circumstances force him to get to know Estraven, and Ai finally sees in him 
""not a man's face and not a woman's, a human face.""

""A profound love between two people involves, after all, the power and chance of doing profound hurt.""
 
But it's really Therem Harth Estraven, who, in my opinion, is the true hero of this story. Estraven sees the promise that the union with Ekumen has for his world. In his attempts to help Ai, he becomes labeled a traitor. But it takes a long time and many trials and tribulations for Ai to recognize Estraven for what and who he is - just HUMAN, to move past the uncomfortable and the prejudice and discover simple human love.  ""It is yin and yang. Light is the left hand of darkness... how did it go? Light, dark. Fear, courage. Cold, warmth. Female, male. It is yourself, Therem. Both and one. A shadow on snow.""
The language of this book was initially a stumbling block for me. It was dry and very cerebral, making it difficult at first to become immersed in the story. But that was the language of Genly Ai, the man who was not meant to be likeable at the very start. But then I got to the first interlude - short and very poetic legends of Gethen which help shed light on the nature of this world and help us see the events of this story in a different context and different light. The beauty that Le Guin's language reaches during these interludes is breathtaking. The segments of the story written in Estraven's voice are also very distinct, very urgent, simple, and filled with so much dignity and quiet resolve that it made my heart leap and weep at the same time. ------------------The Left Hand of Darkness is a deep story of humanity, love, betrayal, alienation, and acceptance. But it is not an easy book to read. It is not meant to take you on an exciting whirlwind ride. Instead its aim is to make the readers think and reflect. It may be slow to start, but it's hard to put down as well. I walked away from it feeling that a part of me has been changed forever - and for the better. I walked away from it with more questions than I had when I started - and that's a very good thing, as far as I am concerned.
""And I saw then again, and for good, what I had always been afraid to see, and had pretended not to see in him: that he was a woman as well as a man. Any need to explain the sources of that fear vanished with the fear; what I was left with was, at last, acceptance of him as he was.""

Something Wicked This Way Comes;Ray Bradbury;1962;1960;293;3.91;136423;yes;['Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Halloween'];"One of Ray Bradbury’s best-known and most popular novels, Something Wicked This Way Comes, now featuring a new introduction and material about its longstanding influence on culture and genre.For those who still dream and remember, for those yet to experience the hypnotic power of its dark poetry, step inside. The show is about to begin. Cooger & Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show has come to Green Town, Illinois, to destroy every life touched by its strange and sinister mystery. The carnival rolls in sometime after midnight, ushering in Halloween a week early. A calliope’s shrill siren song beckons to all with a seductive promise of dreams and youth regained. Two boys will discover the secret of its smoke, mazes, and mirrors; two friends who will soon know all too well the heavy cost of wishes…and the stuff of nightmares.Few novels have endured in the heart and memory as has Ray Bradbury’s unparalleled literary masterpiece Something Wicked This Way Comes. Scary and suspenseful, it is a timeless classic in the American canon.";I read this when I was an insanely romantic teenager and since then the cruel world has beaten all that nonsense out of my brain with bars of iron and wires of barb, and left me bleeding and barfing in a vile ditch, so I should probably not have plucked my old Corgi paperback of Something Wicked out from my most cobwebbed shelf and thought to wander nostalgically recapturing the wonder and enrapturement I once perceived herein. In those faroff days I wanted to be the smile on the bullet, I wanted to be the weathervane, I wanted to run the dark carnival, and above all else I wanted a calliope so I could play mad twisting melodies at three in the morning from the caboose of a train made out of dead men's bones. Instead I got a job in an office, after a few detours, none of which involved a naked living woman in a block of ice. But anyway, when I did reread this book, I could not shake off the growing realisation that none of it made the least bit of sense. Not a single bit. And the dad is a complete steal - it's Atticus Finch back from the dead. And I saw that Ray Bradbury never met a pudding he did not want to over-egg or an emotion he did not want to wring dry. I had grown old. I didn't recognise the place. I didn't know who the boy was who loved this book so much. I knew his name but I couldn't remember his face.It was a bad idea, rereading a book which so knocked me out all those years ago. I'll give it 5 stars for the love I used to have for it, but I don't really recommend it to anyone now. The world has changed and no longer has the stomach for Ray Bradbury's 1950s goldenhued renderings of his own 1920s childhood. So goodbye, then, to Dandelion Wine, another one I loved. What I learned from this book is that Memory Lane has been mined. You walk down that street at your peril.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248596.Something_Wicked_This_Way_Comes
The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress;Robert A. Heinlein;1966;1960;288;4.15;132592;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Politics'];It is a tale of revolution, of the rebellion of a former penal colony on the Moon against its masters on the Earth. It is a tale of a culture whose family structures are based on the presence of two men for every woman, leading to novel forms of marriage and family. It is the story of the disparate people, a computer technician, a vigorous young female agitator, and an elderly academic who become the movement's leaders, and of Mike, the supercomputer whose sentience is known only to the revolt's inner circle, who for reasons of his own is committed to the revolution's ultimate success.;TANSTAAFL = There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.My three favorite books of all time are (in no order) Heart of Darkness, The Dispossessed, and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. When I first read this years ago I loved it, I could not put it down. As Stranger in a Strange Land was a Robert A. Heinlein vehicle for theology, so is Moon is a Harsh Mistress to ideology. And just as The Fountainhead is the better, though less epic, of the pair with Atlas Shrugged, so is Moon is a Harsh Mistress, the more focused and simple of the two, better than Stranger in a Strange Land. I liked the setting, the use of libertarian principles and of course the brilliant work of the Grandmaster himself.This is a virtuoso science fiction futuristic re-telling of the American Revolution. Told from the first person recollection of a computer technician (with thick Russian accent) and of the birth and progress of the Lunar independence.The Moon (Luna to it’s residents – who call themselves Loonies) has been a penal colony for decades. It is the perfect prison, get outside the underground warrens and beyond the air locks and you’re on the moon. Without a pressure suit, you’re dead. There are very little rules and no real laws, so a hardscrabble anarchy has created a loose but tough and resilient populace who want freedom.Certainly this libertarian paradise could have become an anarchistic hell, but in Heinlein’s hard loving hands, his creation is the Free State of Luna. This story tracks with the American Revolution with unfair and distant landowners, inept and uncaring provisional governors (the warden) and even a declaration of independence on the fourth of July. Students of revolutionary movements will also see an allegory for “throwing rocks” as a statement about the earliest stages of discontent and reaction.First published in 1966, this was written at the zenith of his considerable powers and stands as a true classic of the genre. I just re-read this (one the very few books that I have read more than once) and may re-read it again – it’s that good.** 2018 addendum - it is a testament to great literature that a reader recalls the work years later and this is a book about which I frequently think. A friend commented about Heinlein books and I realized as we talked that when I think about Heinlein, my mind automatically defaults to this book. When I read SF I project this on that book and I wonder if that author read and was inspired. This is on my short list of all-time favorites and I think this should be on a very short list of greatest SF books of all time.*** 2021 rereadOf the hundreds of books I’ve read (as I type this in January 2021 over 1700) I have listed eight as my all time favorites: Heart of Darkness, Dune, The Dispossessed, Forever War, American Gods, Neuromancer, Breakfast of Champions – and Heinlein’s magnificent The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. This may be my favorite.I like science fiction. I like Heinlein’s writing. I also like history and political science and ideology. RAH has combined all this into a year 2076 retelling of the American Revolution except from the perspective of the Free State of Luna and of their winning independence from the tyranny of Earth.Central to this story is also a computer that developed consciousness, and in 1966 the idea of an AI was state of the market SF.On every page is Heinlein’s homely personality and his affinity for characterization and dialogue. Modern readers may see this writer (born more than a hundred years ago in 1907) as sexist or racist, but his ideas were socially progressive for his time and he explores themes of sexuality, family, and inclusiveness. His description of open marriages, of multiple partner relationships, and of a line marriage – where husbands and wives can be opted in and can last hundreds of years, was thought provoking.*** 2023 reread - I LOVE this book. On a very short list of my favorite books of all time. You know it’s a book for you when you smile just reading, like a visit from a very close friend.This time around I played close attention to the wonderful characters and their interactions revolving around the revolution of the Free State of Luna. Manny O’Kelly, Wyoh Knott (but don’t call her Why Not) and Professor de la Paz are the central - human - players in this magnificent drama that has it all - action, political and legal thrills, romance, humor, love, death and a very early AI presence in Mycroft Holmes.In the past I have been an apologist for Heinlein, responding to critics spoiling his work as racist or sexist with admonitions that he was actually very progressive for his time. I now want to point out how very progressive this was, with a population of Luna that is not only tolerant but welcoming of just about anything that works. Heinlein’s description of line and clan marriages and poking fun of bigots in North America was some of the best scenes in the book.Heinlein’s championing of libertarian ideals was also again very fun to read. Yes, I know, it’s a rough justice and a due process quagmire but it’s science fiction, have some fun.Brilliant.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16690.The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress
Solaris;Stanisław Lem;1961;1960;204;3.99;112644;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Polish Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];A classic work of science fiction by renowned Polish novelist and satirist Stanislaw Lem.When Kris Kelvin arrives at the planet Solaris to study the ocean that covers its surface, he finds a painful, hitherto unconscious memory embodied in the living physical likeness of a long-dead lover. Others examining the planet, Kelvin learns, are plagued with their own repressed and newly corporeal memories. The Solaris ocean may be a massive brain that creates these incarnate memories, though its purpose in doing so is unknown, forcing the scientists to shift the focus of their quest and wonder if they can truly understand the universe without first understanding what lies within their hearts.;"2012 first read: Many sci-fi authors think that they write about aliens. The truth is, they really don't. Instead, they essentially write about humans. Most sci-fi aliens are little more than an allegory for humanity, a mirror through which we can see ourselves - maybe slightly different-looking, with more (or fewer) appendages, different senses, funny names, different social structures - but still unmistakably human. And so, when we think of aliens as shown in popular literature/ cinematography, 99% of us will imagine these ...
... rather than this... Whichever way the sci-fi aliens are described, there is always something about them that we can relate to. Basically, it serves the age-old purpose of self-insertion of a reader into a book. 
 “We see ourselves as Knights of the Holy Contact. That’s another falsity. We’re not searching for anything except people. We don’t need other worlds. We need mirrors. We don’t know what to do with other worlds. One world is enough, even there we feel stifled. We desire to find our own idealized image; they’re supposed to be globes, civilizations more perfect than ours; in other worlds we expect to find the image of our own primitive past.”
That's when Lem strikes with his unusual and brainy unconventional sci-fi story. He takes the long-standing dream of establishing contact with aliens and turns the concept completely around. His planet-sized (possibly) living ocean is so ... well... alien that there is no way humans can comprehend or relate to its vast alienness. Even worse, the ocean does not seem interested. See, one of the worst things you can do to people is not care, ignore them. As a species, we crave attention and recognition. But, unlike the aliens of our space dreams that may love us or hate us or despise us, the Ocean of Solaris does not seem to particularly care. Which sends humans into a frenzy leading to volumes of scientific research. Does it not understand us? Does it not care? Is it primitive? Is it unbelievably advanced? What's the deal? Are we nothing but annoyance to it, ants crawling on its surface? Is it even alive? As a matter of fact, what is ""alive""?What I think is fascinating about this story is that we never get answers. The ocean remains there, vast and alien, with its secrets unrevealed. All we have is speculation and childlike wonder. And failure to comprehend why it seems to torture humans that study it, sending them living ghosts from their past - in case of psychologist Kris Kelvin, his long-dead wife Harey Rheya (not sure why the name was changed in the translation. EDIT: 2011 translation by Bill Johnston avoids the stupidity of name change and sticks with Harey). Why? We don't know. The beauty and the power of this book is that we will never know. Some things are just not for us to understand. What makes us human is that we will keep trying.The movies based on this book - a beautiful Tarkovsky version and that other one with George Clooney - seemed to focus more on the human characters, which is natural. But to me this will always remain an brilliant, albeit a little dry story of a mysterious and alien ocean which may or may not be alive and may or may not even care.—————————— 
2021 reread: A decade ago I was absolutely mesmerized by Lem’s alien ocean. The chapters that stayed with me after all those years were the ones with mimoids and symmetriads and that gigantic child in Berton’s account. What struck me on a reread a decade later was depiction of humans. The despair, guilt, grief, pain, sacrifice. The pain of self-reflection. The agony of not understanding because it’s impossible.  
 “Human beings set out to encounter other worlds, other civilizations, without having fully gotten to know their own hidden recesses, their blind alleys, well shafts, dark barricaded doors.”
And that atmosphere of the book — building up hallucinatory surrealism of a fever dream, a nightmare that is impossible to wake up from, the horror story feeling complete with disorientation and helplessness, claustrophobically suffocating and teetering on the edge of sanity.The alien ocean is still frustratingly alien. And the interludes on solaristics are still fascinating. And now I also appreciate the people and all the obsessive grief and despair.4.5 stars. 
Buddy read (and buddy Tarkovsky movie watch) with Dennis.———As for translations, definitely Bill Johnston’s (2011) over the old one that was apparently translated from French (which was translated from Polish). Johnston’s one is actually very good.——————Recommended by: Dennis";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95558.Solaris
Ubik;Philip K. Dick;1969;1960;288;4.11;111192;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Mystery', 'Fantasy'];Glen Runciter está muerto. ¿O lo están todos los demás? Lo que es seguro es que alguien ha muerto en una explosión organizada por los competidores de Runciter. De hecho, sus empleados asisten a un funeral. Pero durante el duelo comienzan a recibir mensajes descorcentantes, e incluso morbosos, de su jefe. Y el mundo a su alrededor comienza a desmoronarse de un modo que sugiere que a ellos tampoco les queda mucho tiempo. Esta mordaz comedia metafísica de muerte y salvación (que podrá llevar un cómodo envase) es un tour de force de amenaza paranoica y comedia absurda, en la cual los muertos ofrecen consejos comerciales, compran su siguiente reencarnación y corren el riesgo continuo de volver a morir.;"Phillip K Dick's Ubik flirts with perfection. I inhaled this novel over three days when one of my kids was sick and Christmas break was ending. I started the book on the couch during a  Mythbusters  marathon. By page fifty I wanted to shut the door and leave my kids to forage in the refrigerator for Gatorade and string cheese. And on Sunday night, when I closed the book, I felt satisfied and excited with a novel in a way that doesn't happen much. Ubik is fun, smart, and exhilarating. Ok, let me take a shot at the plot summary. Joe Chip works for a team that shields organizations and the general public from illegal super-psychological activity like, for example, the unethical use of precognition. I think. Anyway, Mr. Chip is down and out, almost too broke to pay the nickel necessary to operate his apartment door. He is charged by his employer (and his employer's wife, currently in “half-life”, a finite state in which the dead and living can interact) with leading a team to Luna in search of the criminals of whom they lost track. From there Ubik takes off into territory defying summarization. I'd need a chart to track all the turns and potentialities. The novel addresses Chip's attempt to separate multiple realities and discern exactly who he is, where he is, and when he is. Somewhere in there Dick batters around the I-Ching and Plato's form philosophy. Ubik's genius emerges in Dick's obsessive attention to detail. He's a remarkably disciplined writer for a guy who sounds completely messed up (more on his biography in a second). The novel never goes dry; Dick balances the esoteric, theoretical analysis with an urgent storyline. Joe Chip's inner monologue, his attempts to piece together the myriad of clues pointing to the establishment and resolution of his questions, is paranoid, desperate, and brilliant. Ubik, and PKD's work in general, is a significant element of the genre's template. This is the third PKD novel I've read, and although I don't want to snap them up in a rush, I'll hit more this year.Oh, I should mention that I read the Library of America edition of this novel. The LOA edition (you know, those heavy black books with the nifty attached bookmark) includes three other novels, notes from Jonathan Lethem, and a detailed author timeline/biography. Holy hell, PDK lived a fucked-up life, between social anxiety, industrial strength drug use, and multiple stints in psychiatric care. That said, I love the fact this novel was published in 1969. Put Ubik in your summer of love pipe and smoke it, hippies. I don't want to become a star-whore. Over the last year I've assigned four books five stars. Maybe I'm getting soft. The little note over the fifth star, however, reads “It was amazing”, and those three words fit Ubik, so I'm sticking with the fifth star. This novel is the poster child for the difference between workmanlike genre fiction (nothing wrong with that) and the kind that makes you want to jump and down with your hands in the air like you're a twelve year old at his first rock concert. I want to hang its poster over my bed and blow kisses to Ubik before I fall asleep.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22590.Ubik
Planet of the Apes;Pierre Boulle;1963;1960;276;3.99;44735;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'France', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook'];"""I am confiding this manuscript to space, not with the intention of saving myself, but to help, perhaps, to avert the appalling scourge that is menacing the human race. Lord have pity on us!""With these words, Pierre Boulle hurtles the reader onto the Planet of the Apes. In this simian world, civilization is turned upside down: apes are men and men are apes; apes rule and men run wild; apes think, speak, produce, wear clothes, and men are speechless, naked, exhibited at fairs, used for biological research. On the planet of the apes, man, having reached to apotheosis of his genius, has become inert.To this planet come a journalist and a scientist. The scientist is put into a zoo, the journalist into a laboratory. Only the journalist retains the spiritual strength and creative intelligence to try to save himself, to fight the appalling scourge, to remain a man.Out of this situation, Pierre Boulle has woven a tale as harrowing, bizarre, and meaningful as any in the brilliant roster of this master storyteller. With his customary wit, irony, and disciplined intellect and style, the author of The Bridge Over the River Kwai tells a swiftly moving story dealing with man's conflicts, and takes the reader into a suspenseful and strangely fascinating orbit.First edition in English here";3.5;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/414895.Planet_of_the_Apes

When industrialist Palmer Eldritch returns from an interstellar trip, he brings with him a new drug, Chew-Z. It is far more potent than Can-D, but threatens to plunge the world into a permanent state of drugged illusion controlled by the mysterious Eldritch.Cover illustration: Chris Moore;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch - A Philip K. Dick novel so crazy I found myself laughing out loud on every page. Here are a dozen key ingredients PKD mixes in his hallucinogenic science fiction roller coaster:The illegal hallucinogenic drug Can-DDrug of choice for those colonists on Mars and other remote planets, a drug enabling its chewers to inhabit the same body and mind-stream and then travel together to an appealing illusory reality in another dimension.The legal (sort of) hallucinogenic drug Chew-ZTaken solo for a solo trip to an alternate reality where, among other possibilities, one can revisit and remake the past in a way that influences the future.Leo BuleroCartoon version of a 1940s gruff, bald, cigar-chomping boss, a man who puts a high premium on maintaining control of market share and control of his sanity.Barney MayersonCartoon version of a 1950s boss want-a-be, a ‘precog’, that is, someone given, via technology, the gift of knowing certain aspects of the future.Miss Rondinella FugateCartoon version of a 1960s attractive, sexy corporate climber who is also a precog and knows exactly how to manipulate men like Barney Mayerson and Leo Bulero.Dr. SmileA psychiatrist who is an advanced computer living in a briefcase, offering advice to men like Barney Mayerson.Emily and her Ceramic PotsA potter who makes pots that have, believe it or not, a profound influence in this futuristic world of interplanetary travel.Richard HnattCurrent husband of Emily and a salesman in New York City, a most demanding and difficult job since the daytime temperature in the Big Apple runs 130 degrees.Dr. Willy Denkmal's E Therapy clinicsThat’s E Therapy as in Evolution Therapy, providing humans with accelerated mental powers. But there are some problems: the therapy distorts your features so you look like a bubble-head. Also, the therapy might backfire and instead of evolving you devolve back into a cruder, less intelligent you.Anne HawthorneAppropriate name, since Anne is a conservative Christian right out of the pages of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Anne is less than thrilled with the drugs and other beings with God-like powers.Hovel on MarsBeing sent to a place like Mars isn’t any fun. There are some advantages, though: the colonists chew their Can-D and everyone has sex with everyone else. Ah, community.Palmer EldritchIf Philip K. Dick was paranoid, then Palmer Eldritch might be his perfect alter ego. Mr. Palmer has several super-human powers that fuel this novel right to the last sentence.Similar to PKD's Dr. Bloodmoney, the most hypercrazy novel I've ever read, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch would spin into a formless mess if it wasn’t for the author's strong sense of interweaving plots and underlying themes. What an absolutely zany, outrageous, bizarre, wild read!“The time, then, had come for him to poison himself so that an economic monopoly could be kept alive, a sprawling, interplanetary empire from which he now derived nothing.”― The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch - American Science Fiction author Philip K.

Lord of Light;Roger Zelazny;1967;1960;296;4.06;33644;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Mythology', 'Hugo Awards'];Earth is long since dead. On a colony planet, a band of men has gained control of technology, made themselves immortal, and now rule their world as the gods of the Hindu pantheon. Only one dares oppose them: he who was once Siddhartha and is now Mahasamatman. Binder of Demons, Lord of Light.;Prince Siddhartha attained enlightenment at the foot of the Bodhi tree and became the Buddha: his teachings swept across India, striking at the roots of decadent Brahmanism. The Hindu priests were understandably alarmed, but were helpless against the doctrine of the eightfold path as the stale air inside a room against the tempest raging outside. So they did the clever thing: after the Buddha's passing, they assimilated him and made him an avatar of Vishnu (in fact, they licked him by joining him). Perhaps this is the fate of all reformers!This much is history. Roger Zelazny takes the bare bones of this story, adds the exotic ingredients of Indian myth and legend haphazardly, seasons it with the spirit of Prometheus who moved against heaven, and serves it up as a science fiction novel. For people who have not tasted exotic and spicy Indian dishes (at least not regularly), this is extraordinary fare indeed: alas, for my jaded palate, this is quite ordinary.Zelazny writes superbly. The novel is structured imaginatively-as Adam Roberts says in the introduction, the author deliberately wrong foots us with the flashback. The language is rich and lush and a bit cloying, like India at its exotic best (or worst), seen from an “Orientalist” perspective. In an age when characterization was almost nonexistent in SF, Zelazny gives us rounded characters who behave consistently. The SF elements are also well developed and consistent with a technology so far advanced that it is “indistinguishable from magic” (to borrow from Arthur C. Clarke).That the author is well acquainted with India is obvious. He knows the names of a lot of Indian gods (not only the Vedic pantheon – Murugan is a Tamil god). From the way the Kathakali performance is described in detail, I am almost sure that Zelazny has travelled in Kerala (my native place). The way each god’s “Attribute” defines him or her is more or less consistent with Hindu mythology – and it has been translated into scientific terms quite convincingly. And the way the “Rakasha” (the Rakshasa s and Asuras of Indian myth) have been described as elemental spirits of the planet, subdued and imprisoned by the human colonisers, closely parallels the real origin of these demons in folklore.But once all the bells and whistles were removed, I found the story of a renegade god moving against the celestial dictators quite ordinary. If the whole Indian pantheon were not in the story, if it was just the tale of a plain “Sam”‘s rebellion, I do not think this book would have merited a second glance at the awards. It was sold under the label of exotic India, like many other orientalist offerings. One might argue that this was Zeazny’s intention, and that there is nothing wrong in it: I would tend to agree. His vision of using Indian myth to flavor a science fiction novel was (at the time of its publication) a bold, path-breaking move. Only thing is, I am not one of the intended audience!I have one more caveat: Zelazny mixes and matches the gods and their attributes with a free hand (especially towards the end). Since these are not true gods but human beings who have taken on these attributes, this is technically OK, but it soon becomes a pot-pourri very difficult to follow. Also, in the process, he saw many of the gods only single dimensionally (this is most notable in the case of Krishna, who is seen only as a lecher).I would recommend this book for people unfamiliar with Indian mythology. I am afraid those who are well-read in the same may feel disappointed.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13821.Lord_of_Light

The Ship Who Sang;Anne McCaffrey;1969;1960;256;4.04;25890;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Romance', 'Young Adult'];Helva had been born human, but only her brain had been saved—saved to be schooled, programmed, and implanted into the sleek titanium body of an intergalactic scout ship. But first she had to choose a human partner—male or female—to share her exhilarating escapades in space!Her life was to be rich and rewarding . . . resplendent with daring adventures and endless excitement, beyond the wildest dreams of mere mortals.Gifted with the voice of an angel and being virtually indestructible, Helva XH-834 anticipated a sublime immortality.Then one day she fell in love!;"It was Thanksgiving, I was out of town, had just gotten ready to head out for dinner when I heard that Anne McCaffrey had passed. It hit me like a punch in the gut. I couldn't quite shake it all evening. What was going on? Sure, I've read her books but she has never been on a list of favorite authors, why was I so affected? I knew L'Engle would be a tough one for me. Butler was just so unexpected. Le Guin is going to turn me into a wreck. But McCaffrey? I've never listed her as an influence or put her on a list of people I want to meet or authors I want to write like (L'Engle, Le Guin & Borges, if you are curious). Yet I was mourning her passing like she was a dear friend. Turns out, I've spent a lot more time with Anne McCaffrey than I would have guessed. There is the Crystal Singer series, and the PTB, I never got into Acorna, of course Pern, the Freedom series, The Rowan (which I recently reread) and its sequels, the Pirate books (including Sassinak - not only a personal favorite but introduced me to Elizabeth Moon for which I am grateful). And then there is The Ship Who Sang. Who doesn't remember reading this book for the first time. Did you cry? If you say no then you don't have a heart. I enjoyed the other Brain books but Helva stole my heart. When I got back from vacation I looked for my copy of The Ship Who Sang but couldn't find it. Not surprising since I tend to give my favorite books away. I started looking in bookstores, new and used, but no one seemed to have a copy. So last week I gave in and ordered it online. Doubt I'll have this copy long as I already have a list in my head of people I need to give it to.Do I need to review this book? It is a classic, if you haven't read it, you should. I don't feel the need to ""sell"" it. However, I do have a few observations from this latest rereading. Perhaps the most superficial but obvious is how well the book stands the test of time. The Ship Who Sang is 50 years old. FIFTY YEARS! Think about how technology has changed in that amount of time. Yet there are very few startlingly out of date references. ""Gay"" is used to mean fun & festive. And if that is the biggest tell that this book is half a century old, how impressive is that? The rest still works well enough that it doesn't jerk you out of the story like many (most) older works. The story is still as strong, the technology as impressive, the characters as real, and the hope as powerful as ever. This is what science ficiton is supposed to do - it shows us the very best of who we are and who we might become. Not perfection (boring) but something to strive towards.So what is it about Anne McCaffrey that makes me read her books (lots and lots of her books) but not mention her when people ask who I read? I recently had a discussion online about the difference between the books we say we read and the books we actually read. I don't have answers yet, but it is a question I am pondering. If you ask me for my top ten favorite science fiction books I would be able to come up with a reputable list off the top of my head. And they would be books I really do adore, books that changed my perspective, changed my mind, changed my life. But you know what science fiction book I have reread the most? Sassinak.

Rocannon's World;Ursula K. Le Guin;1966;1960;258;3.78;21038;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Speculative Fiction'];A world shared by three native humanoid races - the cavern-dwelling Gdemiar, elvish Fiia, and warrior clan, Liuar - is suddenly invaded and conquered by a fleet of ships from the stars. Earth scientist Rocannon is on that world, and he sees his friends murdered and his spaceship destroyed. Marooned among alien peoples, he leads the battle to free this new world - and finds that legends grow around him even as he fights.;"3.5 stars. This 1966 SF novel is part of the impressive two-volume set Ursula K. Le Guin: The Hainish Novels and Stories, just published on Sept. 5, 2017, which a publicist was kind enough to send me. I'm gradually working my way through that collection, which is going to take a good long while. But here's my review for the first novel in the collection, which is Le Guin's first published novel. Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature:In her debut novel Rocannon’s World (1966), Ursula K. Le Guin blends mythic fantasy and science fiction in this appealing, if not notably original, novel. The prologue, “The Necklace,” takes place many years before the main part of the story. Semley, dark-skinned and yellow-haired like all of her people on a remote, unnamed planet (called Formalhaut II by Hainish scientists from the League of All Worlds) is a queen of her people. She and her beloved husband are poverty-stricken, but Semley remembers that once her family owned a fabulous necklace that was stolen in her great-grandmother’s day. Finding it again becomes a passion for Semley, so she leaves one night to find her lost inheritance. Her travels will take her farther than she could have imagined. “The Necklace” was originally published as a stand-alone short story, Semley's Necklace: A Story, an imaginative retelling of the myth of Freya’s necklace Brísingamen, and how her obsession with it ultimately brings her great sorrow.In her travels, Semley met a Hainish scientist, Gaverel Rocannon, who never forgets Semley. Rocannon later travels to her planet as part of a scientific team doing cultural exploration. As the main part of this novel begins, Rocannon’s colleagues and their spaceship are blown up by galactic rebels, leaving Rocannon stranded and alone with the natives of the planet. He has no way to contact galactic authorities to warn them of the danger from these rebels, who are using this world as a secret base for their aggressive war of conquest. Rocannon determines that he needs to make the difficult journey to the rebel base, infiltrate it, and use their ansible ― an instant FTL communication device ― to send out a warning.He and several helpful natives embark on a dangerous cross-country (and sea and mountain) trek, and Rocannon learns things about this unnamed world that he had never learned in his earlier scientific explorations. There are several different humanoid races on this planet, as well as flying windsteeds (an unlikely cross between Pegasus and a tiger) that are vital to the success of the mission.Rocannon’s World is a little old-fashioned and derivative, vaguely Tolkienesque, with native races that are reminiscent of the elves, dwarves, and men, and including what Le Guin herself called “fragments of Norse mythology.” Not all of the science in it is believable; I had major issues swallowing the windsteeds that could carry not one but two men, as a practical matter. Le Guin also admits, in an afterword published in the 1970s, that Rocannon’s “impermasuit,” a near-invisible suit that protects against cold, heat, radioactivity, swordstrokes, and bullets (of moderate velocity) would suffocate the wearer in minutes.But Rocannon’s World also has a reasonably solid plot, with an engaging interplay of science fiction and mythic fantasy, and there are flashes of brilliance in her writing. While Rocannon’s journey has more of a fantasy vibe to it, there are also occasional quotes from League handbooks and handy pocket guides that strengthen the SF element. My imagination was captured by the origin of the ansible in this novel, a concept so useful that it has been adopted not only by Orson Scott Card but many other SF authors.Rocannon’s World will probably be of interest primarily to Le Guin completists and readers who love retro science fiction, but I don’t regret the time I spent in this world.Next up: Planet of Exile.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92610.Rocannon_s_World
The Drowned World;J.G. Ballard;1962;1960;198;3.48;18920;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Novels'];"First published in 1962, J.G. Ballard's mesmerizing and ferociously prescient novel imagines a terrifying future in which solar radiation and global warming have melted the polar ice caps and Triassic-era jungles have overrun a submerged and tropical London. Set during the year 2145, the novel follows biologist Dr. Robert Kerans and his team of scientists as they confront a surreal cityscape populated by giant iguanas, albino alligators, and endless swarms of malarial insects. Nature has swallowed all but a few remnants of human civilization, and, slowly, Kerans and his companions are transformed—both physically and psychologically—by this prehistoric environment. Echoing Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness—complete with a mad white hunter and his hordes of native soldiers—this ""powerful and beautifully clear"" (Brian Aldiss) work becomes a thrilling adventure and a haunting examination of the effects of environmental collapse on the human mind.";"Although today J.G. Ballard is perhaps better known as the author of two books which became major films—Spielberg's Empire of the Sun and Cronenberg's Crash —he was first praised for a quaternity of post-apocalyptic novels published in the early '60's. The Drowned World (1962), the second book in this series—as well as Ballard's second published novel—was greatly admired by readers of speculative fiction and caused Ballard to be considered one of the great lights of the “New Wave.”The Drowned World is often described as a sci-fi version of Heart of Darkness, but if so, it is a topsy-turvy take on the Conrad classic. The world is warming due to an atmospheric erosion caused by events in the sun, and a heat-wave, accompanied by floods, is moving slowly toward the poles. With the heat comes a luxuriance of tropical vegetation, reminscent of the Jurassic period; it seems the Heart of Darkness has come to Old England, not the other way round. When Kurtz (here ”Strangman”) arrives from the south in a motorized yacht filled with dark henchman, he is no spent madman expelling a last breath, but an energetic, grinning sociopath intent on looting the last waterlogged treasures of London.The plot is merely serviceable, the character development sketchy, but plot and character are beside the point. What is important here is setting and theme, perfectly realized by Ballard's precise yet poetic prose. His descriptions--of the pitiless sky, of a ghostly submerged observatory, of the flooded streets of London rife with gargantuan plants, and of a collective nightmare where iguana calls to iguana through an eternal tropical forest--remain in memory long after the book is done.Of course, for those enlightened enough to believe in global warming, this is scary stuff, and close attention to Ballard's themes make it into something even scarier. He postulates a world where extreme climate change may act not only upon our superficial behaviors but also upon the neurological structures of the brain. Could the heat and wetness of an atavistic jungle awake the ancient reptile within? Are the iguanas of our dreams calling to each other? Or are they calling to us?";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16234584-the-drowned-world
Babel-17;Samuel R. Delany;1966;1960;192;3.73;18371;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Audiobook'];Babel-17 is all about the power of language. Humanity, which has spread throughout the universe, is involved in a war with the Invaders, who have been covertly assassinating officials and sabotaging spaceships. The only clues humanity has to go on are strange alien messages that have been intercepted in space. Poet and linguist Rydra Wong is determined to understand the language and stop the alien threat. (Paul Goat Allen);It´s difficult to understand just pieces of this amazing work, as it´s complexity is so interwoven with special innuendos and the author doesn´t care about genre or even writing conventions, making my poor brain hurt. For everyone with a background or profound knowledge in anything with linguistic, language, and all the similar fields, it might be the ultimate revelation, something to read again and again to dive deeper and enjoy while the puzzles unfold.Today it might be hard to difficult to publish a work like this that is so specific and primarily plot and idea driven that just a small minority, even of the readers with interest in Sci-Fi, might find it satisfying. The social Sci-Fi, on the other hand, exploded and provides more and more different ideas that would have been taboo in the golden age of Sci-Fi and most parts of the 20th century, while the eccentric and idea focused works seem to have it harder and harder to get published. A, of course extremely evil, triumvirate of space opera, Hard Sci Fi with elements of cyberpunk, astrophysics, scientific theories,… and social sci-fi controls the output of the genre, leaving many of the too alternative concepts and narrative styles with less hope for large sales. It´s a bit sad, and ironic, as especially the leaving behind of genre conventions and trying out unique world building elements has once been one of the driving forces of Sci-Fi. It´s not as if there weren´t enough independent publishers, self publishers, and indie authors who do write all these works, but they come with the immense problem of missing large scale rating to ensure the readers that the work is no waste of time. I´m already investing quite an amount of time in activism and am not altruistic enough to risk bad reads too, sorry.Back to the book, Delanys´work is dealing with controversial topics and demonstrating the importance of the use and meaning of language, speech, the interpretation of both, and the Saphir Whorf hypothesis, an amazing concept that questions much about identity and opens large range for interpretations and philosophizing.Just people who can find pleasure with unconventional works and don´t care about writing and genre conventions will be happy with this work, as the effort to read this relatively short book shouldn´t be underestimated, but the impacts it had on Sci-Fi is amazing:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel-1...and awed the heck out of me.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1199688.Babel_17
Stand on Zanzibar;John Brunner;1968;1960;672;3.94;16692;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Hugo Awards', 'Classics', 'Cyberpunk', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];Norman Niblock House is a rising executive at General Technics, one of a few all-powerful corporations. His work is leading General Technics to the forefront of global domination, both in the marketplace and politically—it's about to take over a country in Africa. Donald Hogan is his roommate, a seemingly sheepish bookworm. But Hogan is a spy, and he's about to discover a breakthrough in genetic engineering that will change the world ... and kill him. These two men's lives weave through one of science fiction's most praised novels. Written in a way that echoes John Dos Passos' U.S.A. Trilogy, Stand on Zanzibar is a cross-section of a world overpopulated by the billions. Where society is squeezed into hive-living madness by god-like mega computers, mass-marketed psychedelic drugs, and mundane uses of genetic engineering. Though written in 1968, it speaks of 2010, and is frighteningly prescient and intensely powerful.This edition comes with a tipped in collectors' note and an introduction by David Brin.;During the wild 60s, Brunner wrote an amazing novel about overpopulation, corporatocracy, everyday terror, and permanent infodump by news media and corporations and described a setting that became astonishingly true in many details. Reread 2022 with extended reviewDark social sci-fi Sure, he was a bit too optimistic regarding genetic engineering and too pessimistic regarding totalitarian tendencies, but some passages could be out of a present time history book. More social sci fi than focused on action, Brunner describes a complete unleashed market, PR- and commercial industry in a dystopian world as a mixture of Huxley and Orwell with a focus on showing the most perverse and extreme manifestations of such social constructs. Extreme detailIt´s a long read with many worldbuilding details and all these amazing news reports, news flashes, and hundreds of integrated mini-stories that help to push the narrative forward and give depth and extra layers to it. They´re also part of the creepy predictive power, because some could really be seen as 1 to 1 real news reports of past or current events.  Skim and scanSome passages are far too long, some plots unnecessary, and the newsflashes could mostly be ignored. But these details are part of the fascination of the work, so each reader can decide if she/he wants to just go with the main plot and thereby reduce the length or enjoy the full picture of the madness. Language and witThe humor definitively isn´t for everyone, it´s as dark as the work itself, quite explicit, and for less borderliny readers than me maybe a bit too sick, but there are some hard laughs hidden in the abysses of this universe. Part of the fun makes the Clockwork orange style fantasy language that especially shines in dialogues with its strangeness, often combined with preposterous settings and characters' motivations. Style and impact in the genreMy favorite elements are the very detailed descriptions of how the system works, be it by plot or characters, the mentioned many tidbit mini comments, the reactions and motivations of the government and management level, and the complex geopolitical constellations. Not so well known as other Sci-Fi authors, Brunner might have given inspiration to William Gibson and the Cyberpunk genre in general by correctly predicting the development of highly complex societal and global power structures and their long term degeneration.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41069.Stand_on_Zanzibar
Hard to Be a God;Arkadi Strugatski;1964;1960;219;4.13;16346;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Russia', 'Fantasy', 'Russian Literature', 'Classics', 'Dystopia'];The novel follows Anton, an undercover operative from the future planet Earth, in his mission on an alien planet, that is populated by human beings, whose society has not advanced beyond the Middle Ages. The novel's core idea is that human progress throughout the centuries is often cruel and bloody, and that religion and blind faith can be an effective tool of oppression, working to destroy the emerging scientific disciplines and enlightenment.-Don Rumata has been sent from Earth to the medieval kingdom of Arkanar with instructions to observe and to save what he can. Masquerading as an arrogant nobleman, a dueler, and a brawler, he is never defeated, but yet he can never kill. With his doubt and compassion, and his deep love for a local girl named Kira, Rumata wants to save the kingdom from the machinations of Don Reba, the first minister to the king. But given his orders, what role can he play? This long overdue translation will reintroduce one of the most profound Soviet-era novels to an eager audience.Arkady and Boris Strugatsky are widely known as the greatest Russian writers of science fiction, and their 1964 novel Hard to Be a God is considered one of the greatest of their works. Yet until now the only English version (unavailable for over thirty years) was based on a German translation, and was full of errors, infelicities, and misunderstandings. Now, in a new translation by Olena Bormashenko, whose translation of the authors’ Roadside Picnic has received widespread acclaim, here is the definitive edition of this brilliant work.;"“Can you read? Off to the gallows! Write verses? Off to the gallows! Know your multiplication tables? Off to the gallows, you know too much!”
Obviously, the question is twofold here. First, how long can you stand to be an impartial observer in the face of atrocities? Second, how long before the mask you wear becomes your real face? And I suppose a logical third: what use is being a “god” when your powers cannot be used?
“The worst thing is to lose your humanity, Anton. To sully your soul, to become hardened. We’re gods here, Anton, and we need to be wiser than the gods from the legends the locals have created in their image and likeness as best they could. And yet we walk along the edge of a swamp. One wrong step—and down you go in the dirt, and you won’t be able to wash it off your whole life.”
In our utopian Earth future, observers are sent to an alien human feudal culture to observe and record history with the strict mandate of compulsory noninterference. They are sure they got this figured out — they know the stages the culture should go on its way to utopia, and prior interference attempts have been pointless. But Anton - Don Rumata in his alien disguise — can only helplessly watch feudalism sliding into fascism (and a touch Stalin/Beria feel — according to Boris Strugatsky, the antagonist Don Reba used to be Don Rebia - not so subtle anagram of Beria) for so long, seeing the theory for how things should develop not quite hold up while people are dying and are tortured and everything sliding into militant ignorance and oppression. Is impartiality in this case nothing but a callous indifference borne out of privilege?
“How I’d like to let out some of the hatred that’s accumulated over the past twenty-four hours, but it looks like I’ll have no luck. Let us remain humane, forgive everyone, and be calm like the gods. Let them slaughter and desecrate, we’ll be calm like the gods. The gods need not hurry, they have eternity ahead.” 
Anton/Rumata sees this place for the backwards ignorant dirty place that it is, but also can’t help but notice its slide into a place that not only embraces base uneducated vulgar and superstitious mediocrity but also is actively targeting and stomping out any tiny sparks of progress and enlightenment, embracing first the rule of the lowest common denominator and eventually blind and intolerant theocracy. His friends are being tortured and disappeared, and he finds it harder and harder to hold on to his imperial observer mantle. And at the same time he’s recognizing with sheer horror how much easier it becomes for him to act like what’s expected of an aristocrat in Arkanar - cruel, brash, entitled, thoughtless and utterly debauched. The mask is becoming a face, and it’s terrifying and yet tempting.And wouldn’t the *most human* reaction in this nightmare be to abandon the pretense of objectivity, to snap, to rampage, to feel helpless anger not just at those who commit the atrocities but also at those who blindly take it, who keep their heads down, find ways to eek out the meager existence and refuse to see that things can change?
“The cold-blooded brutality of those who slaughter, and the cold-blooded meekness of those who are slaughtered. The cold-bloodedness, that’s the worst thing. Ten people stand around, transfixed with horror, and meekly wait, while another one comes by, picks his victim, and cold-bloodedly slaughters him. These people’s souls are full of rot, and each hour of meek waiting contaminates them even more.”“On the other hand, the habit of enduring and adapting turns people into dumb beasts, who differ from the animals in nothing except anatomy, and who only exceed them in helplessness. And each new day gives rise to a new horror of evil and violence.” 
It’s a tough book, full of things that are unpleasant, disquieting and very uncomfortable. The observations Anton/Rumata makes are harsh and yet very true. You can’t help but feel frustration and helpless anger seeing people in the state of sheeplike submission, not only ignorant but wholeheartedly embracing that ignorance and complacency. You can’t help but feel at least some disappointment in humanity, and question seeing people as “people”, “the masses”, rather than individuals.
“He heard the storm trooper stomping indecisively behind him and suddenly caught himself thinking that insulting words and careless gestures now came naturally to him, that he was no longer playing the role of a highborn boor but had largely become one. He imagined himself like this on Earth and felt disgusted and ashamed. Why? What has happened to me? Where did it go, my nurtured-since-childhood respect and trust in my own kind, in man—the amazing creature called man? Nothing can help me now, he thought in horror. Because I sincerely hate and despise them. Not pity them, no—only hate and despise. I can justify the stupidity and brutality of the kid I just passed all I want— the social conditions, the appalling upbringing, anything at all—but I now clearly see that he’s my enemy, the enemy of all that I love, the enemy of my friends, the enemy of what I hold most sacred. And I don’t hate him theoretically, as a “typical specimen,” but him as himself, him as an individual. I hate his slobbering mug, the stink of his unwashed body, his blind faith, his animosity toward everything other than sex and booze.”
It’s a very short book that packs a lot in its pages — very economically and yet effectively. Philosophical yet engaging, and with questions to which it does not hand nicely formulated simplistically moralistic answers, but instead forces you to think and consider your own reactions and impulses, and perhaps, just like Anton, get a bit horrified at what responses come to you naturally.Very good.4.5 stars.——————Buddy read with Kevin.——————Also posted on my blog.——————Recommended by: Kevin Lopez";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/759517.Hard_to_Be_a_God
The Stainless Steel Rat;Harry Harrison;1961;1960;208;3.92;15923;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Crime', 'Fantasy'];In the vastness of space, the crimes just get bigger and Slippery Jim diGriz, the Stainless Steel Rat, is the biggest criminal of them all. He can con humans, aliens and any number of robots time after time. Jim is so slippery that all the inter-galactic cops can do is make him one of their own;This was an interesting book to read. Pulp sci-fi written in 1961 and reprinted dozens of times. First in a successful and long running series. My copy comes from the late 80s when it was selling very well.The main points of interest for me were how poor a prediction of future technology it was, and how badly sci-fi was written 55 years ago.The Stainless Steel universe has the 'standard' many-times-faster-than-light travel, instant communication (via psychic telephone men this time), and highly intelligent robots.A strange distinction is made between robots and computers. The robots have 'robot brains' and can do complex jobs like being policemen. (some run on coal!)Computers on the other hand do bugger all. You feed them navigation instructions on tape. They take anything from 1o seconds to several minutes to search modest databases. And that's pretty much it.Files are held in filing cabinets on paper. Our hero spends a fair time rustling his way through dusty heaps of files.Currency is paper and coin. Our hero (a thief who turns policeman) steals money in bags and carries it to other planets hidden in his luggage.So in short, the laws of physics are overturned at will with not even a two-word description of the engines or principles involved, and the computer revolution goes unanticipated.The story is a rather silly one about chasing a murderous female criminal who Slippery Jim falls in love with in a deeply unconvincing 1950s movie kind of way. The plot is pretty thin and involves a bunch of face-changing and unlikely guesswork. The world/universe building are very basic and rather uninspired.I found the book's only saving grace to be that the first person narrator, Jim, has a strong, lively voice with a measure of humour to it. Given that the sci-fi 'failings' were pretty common to most (all?) of the sci-fi around at the time I guess the strong voice accounts for the books' popularity.Essentially this work was 'of its time' and has dated badly.Fortunately it's a very short book, perhaps only 50,000 words or so.

""Scar"" Gordon was on the French Riviera recovering from a tour of combat in Southeast Asia , but he hadn't given up his habit of scanning the Personals in the newspaper. One ad in particular leapt out at him:""ARE YOU A COWARD? This is not for you. We badly need a brave man. He must be 23 to 25 years old, in perfect health, at least six feet tall, weigh about 190 pounds, fluent English, with some French, proficient in all weapons, some knowledge of engineering and mathematics essential, willing to travel, no family or emotional ties, indomitably courageous and handsome of face and figure.

So he went to that apartment and was greeted by the most beautiful woman he'd ever met. She seemed to have many names, but agreed he could call her ""Star."" A pretty appropriate name, as it turned out, for the empress of twenty universes.Robert A. Heinlein's one true fantasy novel, Glory Road is as much fun today as when he wrote it after Stranger in a Strange Land. Heinlein proves himself as adept with sword and sorcery as with rockets and slide rules and the result is exciting, satirical, fast-paced, funny and tremendously readable -- a favorite of all who have read it. Glory Road is a masterpiece of escapist entertainment with a typically Heinleinian sting in its tail.";"Piers Anthony should be glad that Glory Road was Robert A. Heinlein’s only fantasy work since it gives the fantasy writer a run for his money, especially the Xanth series. Actually, since Heinlein published Glory Road in 1964 and Anthony did not publish A Spell for Chameleon until 1977, the question may be: How much was Anthony influenced by Heinlein? I grew up reading RAH and so reading him now feels a little like coming home. His frank libertarianism and anachronistic sexism, even his corny barbs, make me smile and turn the page. Published in 1964 and only losing the Hugo Award to Clifford Simak’s brilliant Way Station, Glory Road is a rambunctious barnstormer of a fantastic adventure. Maybe the coolest element of this book is Heinlein’s exploration of what happens after “and they lived happily ever after.” I have long said that the 60s were his zenith period, where he was at his masterful best, after the juvenile publication years and before his aging experiments with weirdness. Glory Road is a fair representative of this middle chapter in his work, a fitting companion to The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Starship Troopers and Stranger in a Strange Land; but it is also a pre-cursor of his wildly imaginative later works like The Cat Who Walks Through Walls. A very good read.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50856.Glory_Road

Now people unquestioningly accept the Tripods' power. They have no control over their thoughts or their lives.But for a brief time in each person's life—in childhood—he is not a slave. For Will, his time of freedom is about to end—unless he can escape to the White Mountains, where the possibility of freedom still exists.;"The White Mountains (The Tripods #1), John ChristopherThe Tripods is a series of young adult novels written by John Christopher, beginning in 1967.The White Mountains, Life goes on largely as it had in the pre-industrial era, excepting that all adult humans are subject to Tripod control. Protagonist Will, a thirteen-year-old boy, living in the (fictional) English village of Wherton, is looking forward to the next ""Capping Day"", until a chance meeting with a mysterious fake-capped man named Ozymandias prompts him to discover a world beyond the Tripods' control. He is accompanied by his cousin Henry and a French teenager named Jean-Paul Deliet, nicknamed ""Beanpole"". The novel climaxes with Henry and Beanpole discovering that earlier, when Will had been captured by a Tripod, he had been unknowingly implanted with a tracking device. When Henry and Beanpole remove the device, a nearby Tripod attacks them, but the boys defeat the Tripod and eventually join the resistance, located in the eponymous White Mountains.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز ششم ماه سپتامبر سال1999میلادیعنوان: کوههای سفید، از مجموعه چهارگانه های جان کریستوفر؛ نوشته: جان کریستوفر؛ مترجم: ثریا کاظمی؛ چاپ نخست، تهران، کانون پرورش فکری کودکان و نوجوانان، سال1349؛ در208ص؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده20معنوان: کوههای سفید، از مجموعه چهارگانه های جان کریستوفر؛ نوشته: جان کریستوفر؛ مترجم: مهرداد تویسرکانی؛ تهران، قدیانی، کتابهای بنفشه، سال1386؛ در199 ص؛ شابک9789644179143؛رمان‌های چهارگانه «جان کریستوفر»، سری «سه پایه ها»، کتاب نخستینش با عنوان «کوه‌های سفید» است؛ «ویل» در دهکده‌ ای کوچک، در «انگلستان» زندگی می‌کند؛ زندگیش، همانند هر نوجوان دیگری است، که منتظر است، تا جشن کلاهک گذاری او انجام شود؛ تا اینکه، دوستش «جک»، نشانه‌ هایی از بقایای یک تمدن باستانی را، به او نشان می‌دهد، که پیش از «سه‌ پایه‌ ها»، وجود داشته‌ است؛ «جک» اعتراف می‌کند، که از کلاهک‌ گذاری می‌ترسد؛ اما چند روز بعد، او نیز، همانند همهٔ ی نوجوانان دیگر، کلاهک‌ گذاری می‌شود؛ پس از این ماجرا، «جک» کوشش می‌کند، از «ویل» دور بماند، چون به علت وجود کلاهک، «ویل» را، برای باورهای خویش، خطرناک می‌داند؛ مدتی بعد، یک فرد ناشناس، به نام «ازماندیاس»، «ویل» را، از وجود یک پایگاه مبارزه، با «سه‌ پایه‌ ها»، باخبر می‌کند، که در «کوه‌های سفید» قرار دارد؛ این رخداد باعث می‌شود، «ویل»، به همراه پسر عمویش «هنری»، از دهکده، به سمت «کوه‌های سفید»، فرار کند؛ آن‌ها در آن راه، با پسر دیگری، به نام «بینپل»، مواجه می‌شوند، که علاقه ی بسیاری، به استفاده از ابزار باستانیان دارد؛ و ...؛تاریخ بخنگام رسانی 27/11/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 12/11/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64316.The_White_Mountains
Martian Time-Slip;Philip K. Dick;1964;1960;262;3.78;13479;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics'];On the arid colony of Mars the only thing more precious than water may be a ten-year-old schizophrenic boy named Manfred Steiner. For although the UN has slated 'anomalous' children for deportation and destruction, other people—especially Supreme Goodmember Arnie Kott of the Water Workers' union—suspect that Manfred's disorder may be a window into the future. But what sort of future? And what happens to those unfortunates whom Manfred ushers into it? In Martian Time-Slip Philip K. Dick uses power politics and extraterrestrial real estate scams, adultery, and murder to penetrate the mysteries of being and time.;Martian Time Slip by Philip K. Dick, published in 1964, is one of PKDs better books. Set on Mars, this is largely about Terran colonists taking care of business. Dick provides a snapshot of social, political and economic life on Mars. “Bleekmen” are the long suffering indigenous extra-terrestrial native Martians, cast aside like Native Americans and called the N word by a fat cat union boss. Carrying on the tradition set by Robert A. Heinlein in Red Planet and Ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles, PKD’s Mars is the remnant of an ancient, long lost civilization, and the present day Bleekmen are a shadowy vestige of a once proud race. But more than just a science fiction narrative about a colonist life on Mars, PKD provides close glimpses into the lives of the colonists and describes how human nature does not change. The Martian colonists continue to struggle with the same issues of jealousy, guilt, greed, and self-serving rationalization as people on earth do in the 60s when this was written and now, 50 years later – still relevant today.This is good PKD, and a fan will notice many ubiquitous PKD elements such as schizophrenia and suicidal tendencies and yet another character as an appliance repairman. Like other great PKD books, I am left amazed that he was not more popular in his own lifetime. This is a vibrant, well-written narrative full of erudite observations and keen characterization. He was truly a great science fiction writer, one of the greatest, but also transcended the genre as a good writer in any venue.*** 2023 reread - PKD rarely disappoints and he most certainly does not in this 1964 publication. I wrote the above review a few years ago and since then I have come to appreciate his writing even more. First off, this made me consider that he wrote this as a response to Ray Bradbury’s Mars. To Bradbury, Mars was not so much the fourth planet, but the “other”. It was a setting for fantasy writing, which in Ray’s able hands meant that it was a vehicle for allegory and metaphor, not to be taken as a straight SF story. Ray could write, “and they got into the rocket and went to Mars” and it was not sloppy, fanciful SF but a fantastic way to view our world in the periphery, to glimpse our world from the shadows and penumbra of expressionist art.So Phil crafted his Mars like Ray had, not as a distant and cold, uninhabitable place but sort of like an Iowa farm. Colonists from Earth can breathe and walk around unaided and Phil, like Ray had a few years before, used this easily disproven science fiction setting as a theatrical allegory to discuss subjects like colonization, immigration, racism, capitalism and social mores. And it is PKD after all so we also have schizophrenia, drug use, questioned reality and androids.The Bleekmen.Bradbury and Heinlein, and probably many other writers wrote about the Martian canals and described the lingering Martian race as the dying remnants of a once proud empire. Dick’s Martians, the Bleekmen, are portrayed as a poverty stricken indigenous people who are living out their existence trampled under the feet of the invading Earth colonists. But like the Fremen from Frank Herbert’s great writing, there is a lot more to the desert dwellers than meets the eye.Herbert? Dune, you say? But Phil first published this in 1964 and Dune first came out in 1965. Are you actually suggesting that Frank Herbert was influenced by Philip K. Dick.No, I’m not. But what I am suggesting is a literary gestalt, a synchronicity of psychological thought that had divergent origins but nonetheless creates a pattern that can be seen and identified. Consider that Lawrence of Arabia came out in 1962 and that the world witnessed, in the early sixties, a renaissance of thought revolving around Middle Eastern experience and how this culture was contrasted and compared to Western civilization. Phil’s Bleekmen also reminded me of the Australian indigenous folks with their dream time and walk about sensibilities.Finally, the character of Manfred Steiner as a schizophrenic, time traveling prophet joins other PKD players like Hoppy Harrington, Pris Stratton, and Barney Mayerson as deeply damaged but potent agents of change.A MUST read for PKD fans and this would actually not be a bad introduction to new readers.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/697251.Martian_Time_Slip

Le Guin;1966;1960;126;3.72;12378;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Classics'];The Earth colony of Landin has been stranded on Werel for ten years. But ten of Werel's years are over 600 terrestrial years. The lonely & dwindling human settlement is beginning to feel the strain. Every winter --a season that lasts for 15 years-- the Earthmen have neighbors: the humanoid hilfs, a nomadic people who only settle down for the cruel cold spell. The hilfs fear the Earthmen, whom they think of as witches & call the farborns. But hilfs & farborns have common enemies: the hordes of ravaging barbarians called gaals & eerie preying snow ghouls. Will they join forces or be annihilated?;"A pretty strong 3 stars, but I've dropped off of my initial 3.5 star (rounded up) rating. Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature:We’re on the backwater planet Werel, where a human colony from Earth landed some 600 years ago, dropped off by a starship than then left them to fight an unnamed enemy of humanity. Stranded ever since, and having lost all communications with galactic society, this group is slowly dying out, unable to thrive in Werel’s environment (among other things, the rate of spontaneous abortion and stillbirths is extremely high). They’re holding on to as much technology as they are able, but are slowly losing ground.Werel also contains other tribes of humans in a primitive, superstitious pre-wheel society. These humans have been on the planet far longer, seeded by the Hainish galactic civilization countless millennia ago. There’s cautious trading and relations between the more recent arrivals, but also deep suspicion of the “farborn” by the natives, with their blue-black skins and technology that the natives don’t comprehend. Their peoples have been separated for so long that the farborn can’t successfully have children with the natives, who they call hilfs (highly intelligent life forms).The unique thing about Werel is that one of its years is equivalent to 60 normal Earth years. So every season lasts for 15 years, and Winter is coming ― which is truly brutal; everyone just hunkers down and survives on the food they’ve been able to store. But now word has come that a group of barbaric nomads, the Gaal, has organized into a mass army and is marching on both the farborn and the local natives, killing everyone in their path.The farborn and the local hilfs make a tentative, hard-won deal to cooperate in fighting the Gaal. That deal violently falls apart when Agat Alterra and Rolery, a farborn man and a hilf woman, enter into what seems to be a very ill-advised fling, forbidden by hilf society on pain of death. Now the barbarians are at the door, and everyone’s in trouble.Initially I was mentally dinging this novel for relying on insta-love, but it’s not really that. It’s more infatuation and loneliness on the part of both Agat and Rolery, which is eminently believable. It begins as a temporary relationship, a coming together for comfort and sex, though it’s deeper and more meaningful than just a fling. But both Rolery and Agat think their secret relationship won’t ― can’t ― last. As everything goes south, literally and figuratively, they may find out differently.Planet of Exile is the second novel in the two-volume Ursula K. Le Guin: The Hainish Novels and Stories collection that I’m currently making my way through. At the end of the first volume is a fascinating commentary, written by Le Guin in the 70s, in which she chides herself for falling into fairly traditional sexual roles with this novel. However, as Le Guin also points out, Rolery, as quiet as she is, has grit and determination, and is much more of an active change catalyst than she may seem to be at first glance.One of the more interesting aspects of Planet of Exile is anthropological: Le Guin’s creation of a primitive human society and what happens when it exists side by side with, but relatively separated from, a more advanced civilization. The Notes section at the end of the Hainish Novels and Stories collection point out some of the features of the hilf society that echo actual native cultures on Earth, including avoiding direct eye contact (considered an aggressive gesture in many Native American groups) and the ritual of stone-pounding.Planet of Exile is a very short novel, one of Le Guin’s earliest. The scientific underpinnings of this tale were rather suspect in several ways; you just have to roll with them. But I still enjoyed the read; even in her early days, Le Guin’s emerging talent is clear. Points to her for including an interracial romance in a 1966 science fiction novel, and also for having the black people be the far more advanced civilization. In the 60s, that was significant.I wouldn’t necessarily recommend Planet of Exile as a stand-alone read, but read in conjunction with her next novel, City of Illusions, which deals with some travelers from Werel many generations later, its impact on me was greatly enhanced.Content note: There's a sexual relationship, but it's very subtly handled. No explicit sex.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201882.Planet_of_Exile
The Invincible;Stanisław Lem;1964;1960;223;4.15;12311;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Polish Literature', 'Classics', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"The Invincible (Polish: Niezwyciężony) is a science fiction novel by Polish writer Stanislaw Lem, published in 1964. The Invincible originally appeared as the title story in Lem's collection Niezwyciężony i inne opowiadania (""The Invincible and Other Stories""). A translation into German was published in 1967; an English translation by Wendayne Ackerman, based on the German one, was published in 1973. An interstellar 2nd-class cruiser called Invincible, lands on Regis III which seems bleakly uninhabited, to investigate the loss of sister ship, Condor.";It´s important to know one´s sci-fi tropes on rescue and search missions with seemingly invincible human spaceships. It could help to avoid foreseeable debacles. Some of the most fascinating sci-fi plot devices are united to one of Lem´s more action and tech focused than philosophical and funny novels, dealing with elements such as:Nanotechnology in the form of the big, unknown, difficult to understand enemy nobody deems even possible, I don´t know if this is one of the first or the first kind of description of such a form of appearance in the history of sci-fi. There were similar ideas in mythology, but these were more fantasy and psi fueled than with a technological background.What happened to them, will it happen to us too? Not knowing what, and later why, could have been done to the humans who landed before the protagonists arrived and not being sure where the danger on  a seemingly empty world without life could have come from  makes the fear, terror, and hence resulting explanation attempts a thriller whodunnit style adventure, a cosmic horror great old Cthulhu mystery.Paranoia sets in and a seemingly primitive enemy is able to awake different feelings between existential crises and pure fear in the humans, showing that even the  oldest artifacts and dysfunctional trash of million year old alien civilizations are enough to easily destroy the best and most sophisticated human tech with simple swarm algorithms and sheer quantity.I wonder a bit why Lem didn´t write more easygoing, definitively quicker to write and much less exhausting to read, novels that were more similar to movies than to sophisticated, philosophical debates and cynical views on any aspect of human nature and condition. It could be explained by the fact that Lem decided to completely stop writing ever so trivial novels and sci-fi in later life, because society was, is, and will be too lame to motivate ingenious prodigy writers to continue their groundbreaking work, and that he subconsciously somewhat already had the intuitive feeling of having to write as complex and astonishing before, to at least justify that he wastes his time and talent with high brow pulp.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/251633.The_Invincible

But when Logan meets and falls in love with Jessica, he begins to question the very system he swore to protect and soon they're both running for their lives. When Last Day comes, will you lie down and die... or run!";"In the year 2011, it is impossible to discuss the Logan's Run novel without mentioning the 1976 movie, which I believe has surpassed the original work in terms of notoriety. Upon comparison, the reason for this is all too clear. While my modern tastes found the 70's movie to be rather charming, I cannot say the same for the novel.The first problem comes with the age limit. With no character over 21, descriptions of people as ""man"" and ""woman"" are confusing and try the limits of my suspension of disbelief. At no point was I convinced of the youth of the characters. The author very clearly just wrote whatever personality he pleased with no consideration to the limits imposed by his setting. (as a side note, the movie sets the age limit at the much more believable 30)Moreover, the novel fails to familiarize the reader with the structure and composition of the world before plowing around in it. New locales are clumsily introduced immediately before the scenes in which the appear and abandoned right as the reader begins to get acclimated.I came to this book hoping for a deeper world than that of the movie, and I was completely let down. The premise is intriguing, but honestly if you'd like to look into Logan's world, watch the movie and save yourself a couple hours.Recommended for:*People who hate movies*People with bad taste";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73654.Logan_s_Run
This Immortal;Roger Zelazny;1966;1960;216;3.9;12027;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Hugo Awards', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction'];Conrad Nomikos has a long, rich personal history that he'd rather not talk about. And, as Arts Commissioner, he's been given a job he'd rather not do. Escorting an alien grandee on a guided tour of the shattered remains of Earth is not something he relishes—especially when it is apparent that this places him at the center high-level intrigue that has some bearing on the future of Earth itself.;"""Do you not see a convergence of life and myth, here, during the last days of life on this planet?"" Somewhere between ""Heart of Darkness"" and ""Tales of the Dying Earth"", Roger Zelazny found once again a story to tell about ordinary people acting like Gods in the desolate aftermath of a world war. ""Lord of Light"" may be my favorite book in Zelazny's catalogue, but ""This Immortal"" comes real close on its heels. Instead of exploring the intricacies of the Hindu Pantheon, this time the author goes for the classical Greek mythology. ""What is wrong with being born on Christmas?""""The gods, deem it a bit presumptuous. For this reason, children born at that time are not of human blood. They are called the kallikanzaroi. Ideally, they look something like those guys with horns and hooves and all, but they don't have to. They could look like me, my parents decided – if they were my parents. So they left me on a hilltop, to be returned. Born under a bad sign, Conrad tries to make the best of the hand Fate has dealt him. Either through a godlike intervention or as a by-product of radiation from a nuclear war that has destroyed the planet, Conrad has become an immortal, a sort of Earth spirit that has refused to abandon his home when the rest of the human survivors of the cataclysm have fled to the stars, to become refugees on the planets ruled by the more advanced Vegan civilization.With his mutant genes, Conrad has inherited also some of the sly intelligence of his ancestor Odysseus, enabling him to switch identities and trick databases from pinpointing his real age. Known at various times as a kallikanzaroi, a terrorist, a mutant, a changeling, Nomikos, Karaghiosis, Ozymandias (""I walked on through the mess time makes of greatness."") , Conrad is at the beginning of the story ignoring dire warnings from his girlfriend Cassandra ( ""I have a feeling,"" she said, ""that you are heading into some sort of danger."" ) and embarks on a mission for the planetary government, on which he serves as Commissioner of Arts, Monuments and Archives. He is supposed to guide a VIP alien from Vega on a tour of the Old Earth ruins: ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, etc... ""Who is Cort Myshtigo?""""Vegan actor, journalist. Important one. Wants to write about what's left of Earth. So I've got to show it to him. Me. Personally. Damn!"" Cort Myshtigo may have a secret agenda for inspecting the Earth – either to develop it as a tourist resort for rich Vegans or to recommend abandoning the planet altogether. Conrad and the rest of the humans who refused to go into exile, some of them also hiding supernatural powers, are too poor to to survive without Vegan handouts, yet too proud to become third rate immigrants for the aliens. So they roll down the red carpet for Cort Myshtigo and assign Conrad to find out what the deal truly is. The Vegans would like to get the home world problem off their hands. Sure, they want to visit it. It is instructive, sobering, humbling, and downright frightening for them to come here and see what can be done to a world. The journey through the broken down Earth, filled with Hot spots of radiations, mutant beasts and myths roaming the deserts of North Africa and the rocky hills of Peloponnese is instructive, sobering, humbling and downright frightening for the reader, too. Conrad discovers that an assassin or two has infiltrated his party and is forced to act as the alien's bodyguard even as he decides if it would not be better to kill the damn tourist himself. There's a lot of action in this short story, and wily tricks played by the Greek on his companions ( ""Born to knot a tiger's tail, that is the saying for people such as you."" ), but in the end the novel becomes an elegy for what was lost in the collective madness of our human race. The forces of final disruption were already goose-stepping amidst the ruins, arms upraised ... Conrad / Nomikos / Karaghiosis may look as ugly as sin to an outsider, but he has the power of the earth running through his blood. Like Antaeus he draws strength from the land and he may yet guide us towards an Earth reborn. I don't want to spoil the outcome of his confrontation with home grown terrorists, alien spies and reawakened mythological bests, but I recommend you try this intense post-apocalyptic story for yourself.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13827.This_Immortal
Orphans of the Sky;Robert A. Heinlein;1963;1960;224;3.78;11329;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Space', 'Space Opera'];"An umbrella title for the novelette Universe and its sequel novella Common Sense, published originally in 1941 in two different issues of Astounding Science Fiction. First published under this title in 1963.Heinlein gives us one of the earliest uses in science fiction of the ""generation ship"" idea, a huge spaceship transporting an entire community of humans to a destination so distant that generations will pass during its journey. And as Heinlein demonstrates, the origins of the community can become forgotten, misinterpreted, and otherwise distorted with the long passage.";Lord of the Flies meets Lost in Space. Not one of Heinlein's masterpieces but also not bad, very imaginative and creative. At it's best it is an interesting religious and political allegory, at worst it is campy pulp. But not bad. I think the producers of Disney's Wall-E may have been influenced somewhat by the generational ship concept. This began as a couple of novelettes in the early 40s and then put together in book form and published as a novel in 1963, so this was at least one of his earliest ideas. Like many Heinlein novels, there is inherent and almost casual violence and, beginning to be disturbing, an ongoing theme of cannibalism. Also an early example of polygamy, Heinlein was not a traditionalist. Very good for the genre.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50832.Orphans_of_the_Sky

And, like many parents, they waited for him to get over it, but it started to get worse.

So he told them about Chocky—the person who lived in his head.Cover Artist: Harry Willock.;This short novel taught me an unexpected lesson on my own fixed mindset. Imagine an alien lifeform that sneaks into the mind of a child. What would you think?Well, I can tell you what I expected: brutal conflicts, life-threatening confrontations, mobilisation of violent resistance to keep humanity safe from the evil extraterrestrial power that wants to colonise us in order to dominate our lives and exploit our weaknesses. That is not what I got, though. And I have to reflect on the fact that my expectations were so stereotypical. Why would I expect a highly intelligent, curious extraterrestrial explorer to be as evil and stupid as humans have proven to be, over and over again? Why would I expect it to be even worse? Why would I feel threatened by the unknown, even before I see any signs of danger?The answer to my question to myself is that human beings are conditioned to distrust anything that is different from themselves. And it takes a lot of thinking and mental training to understand that our own way of life is not the universal default setting. This novel tells the story of a young boy who gets the incredible chance to discuss our planet with someone who sees it with objective, indifferent eyes, someone who tries to understand why it is the way it is, and how it could improve. Written in 1968, it raises such relevant questions as energy sources, environmentalism, conformity and political exploitation of scientific progress. It shows the oxymoronic approach to parenting that still dominates any parent-teacher-talk: the idea that your child is an exceptional genius, and yet “perfectly normal and average” at the same time, a child that it sticks out but also blends in. It holds up a mirror to humanity and points at the violent rejection we feel when we recognise something “out of order”, or just focused and talented in a special, “unnormal” way.The beautiful ending conveys a message to those in a powerful, strong position: sometimes withdrawing from that power and letting children develop at their own pace is the most loving and caring thing you can do. Sometimes successful careers, fame and celebrity are dangerous and not to be encouraged. Sometimes less ambitious, quiet self-fulfilment in art or literature is to be preferred. Sometimes less is more. That certainly rings true for this short novel: less drama, but more thought-provoking ideas than in most bestselling science fiction. Recommended, wholeheartedly!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/161849.Chocky

The ultimate warriors, they are known for their deadly rages, unbreakable honor, and fierce independence. No man rules the Dorsai, but their mastery of the art of war has made them the most valuable mercenaries in the known universe. Donal Graeme is Dorsai, taller and harder than any ordinary man. But he is different as well, with talents that maze even his fellow Dorsai. And once he ventures out into the stars, the future will never be the same.;"Whether Dorsai is to your particular taste or not, you’ll find echoes of it in almost every other modern Military Science Fiction novel. Released around the same time as Starship Troopers, these two novels pretty much kickstarted the genre. Some folks prefer the more visceral, “man on the ground” approach of Troopers, while others gravitate toward the strategic , or long view, approach of Dorsai!. Either way, it didn’t take authors long to realise the benefits of combining both these two aspects into their stories.As for me, I really enjoyed this book (as I did Troopers). The serial origins of the novel are at times apparent, but hey, some of the best novels ever were wrought from the same beginnings (Dune, anyone?).The novel also has an alternate title, which has a nice retro ring to it:

The Penultimate Truth;Philip K. Dick;1964;1960;191;3.77;10405;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Novels'];World War III is raging - or so the millions of people crammed in their underground tanks believe. For fifteen years, subterranean humanity has been fed on daily broadcasts of a never-ending nuclear destruction, sustained by a belief in the all powerful Protector. But up on Earth's surface, a different kind of reality reigns. East and West are at peace. Across the planet, an elite corps of expert hoaxers preserve the lie.Cover Illustration: Chris Moore;"“The masses had egged their leaders on to war in both Wes-Dem and Pac-Peop. But once the masses were out of the way, stuffed down below into antiseptic tanks, the ruling elite of both East and West were free to conclude a deal . . .”Unfortunately, that does not sound too farfetched. Those neologisms, though. If you noticed the “Wes-Dem and Pac-Peop” in the first sentence and “East and West” in the second you will have probably figured them out. The Penultimate Truth is not one of PKD’s most accessible 60s books, which means it is still much more readable than some of his 80s books, VALIS especially. The main reason why I found this book to be less immediately accessible than most PKDs is the number of neologisms he dropped in the early part of the book, practically from page 1. Don’t let that put you off, though, PKD knew what he was doing, just read on and you will find that the ones who have not already inferred are later explained in the narrative.Set in the (then) far future, after World War III, fought by “leadies” (robots designed to withstand nuclear radiation) representing the military of the east and the west. Using leadies instead of humans may have saved the cost in lives of human soldiers but the war rendered much of the Earth surface uninhabitable and radioactive. Most of the human population flee to live underground in enormous antiseptic tanks, called “ant tanks”. The war on the surface soon ends, however, but the elites above ground decide to keep this information from the “tankers” living underground to ensure that there are more elbow room and resources for them to enjoy. The elite “Yance-men” are soon established in “demesnes”, huge picturesque lands with villas and private parks; while the subterranean tankers continue to eke out a meagre existence and continue production of leadies, now used above ground as butlers and bodyguards. As the rich and powerful begin to scheme against each other, and conditions in the ant tanks become increasingly unbearable, some tankers begin to emerge…I was floundering a bit at the beginning, but once the setting and characters begin to sink in (probably around page 50) I was thinking “Hmm! Socio-political dystopian satire from PKD, that is not something you see every day”. I thought it was going to be something along the line of  1984 or  Brave New World, but that is not how Uncle Phil rolled. This book is closer in spirit to Heinlein’s  The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, partly socio-political satire, but also a bona fide science fiction novel. There is also an element of locked room murder mystery; a T2000-like melty robot did it, but under whose direction? The case is investigated by a highly competent psychic detective and the details are amusingly convoluted. Underneath it all Dick is making a commentary about the power of propaganda and the kind of people who write them, deception is clearly a central theme.Like all PKD books I have ever read things are not what they seem in The Penultimate Truth. There is a presidential “Protector” called Talbot Yancy, dreamed up by the Yance-men (hence the name) above ground, who gives regular inspirational speeches to the poor tankers, but who is, in fact, a simulacra; not even a robot, a sort of mannequin hooked up to a computer which feeds speeches through it. Later on, it transpires that Yancy can be more than that, a delightful twist you would have to be mad to see coming.The Penultimate Truth is, to my mind, not top tier PKD but a satisfying dose of that addictive PKD weirdness to keep me going until the next time. This is my first PKD book for this year, I expect to read at least one or two more from him later this year, I can’t really stay away from his stuff for long. To paraphrase the late great Robin Williams, ""Reality is just a crutch for people who can't cope with PKD.""___________________Notes:• There is an excellent Afterward by  Thomas M. Disch, that clearly analyses the themes of this novel.“The moral of the novel is clear: Government is a conspiracy against the people, and it is maintained by the illusion of a permanent crisis that exists, for the most part, as a media event.”• There is a lot of fun future tech in The Penultimate Truth, the leadies, the simulacra, and my favorite, the “rhetorizer”, a hilarious aid to writing speeches.• The robot assassination scene is a virtuoso piece of writing.• Another crazy PKD conceit. Some people move in to live on radioactive hotspots to claim their stake on a future demesne before the radioactivity disperses and the land becomes valuable. The upshot of this investment is that the owners gradually die of radioactive poisoning and die before they realize their ambitions.• If you need any help with the neologisms in this book check out this page from The World Dick Made.___________________Quotes:“They had been born onto the surface of a world and now that surface with its air and sunlight and hills, its oceans, its streams, its colors and textures, its very smells, had been swiped from them and they were left with tin-can submarine—figuratively—dwelling boxes in which they were squeezed, under a false light, to breathe repurified stale air, to listen to wired obligatory music and sit day long at workbenches making leadies.”“The tankers were entitled to something they did not have; they were the victims of robbers. Theft had been committed against all the millions of them, and there had been no moral or legal remedy all these years.”“The man is so close to the forces of death, living there as he does in that hot-spot, seared day after day by the radiation.”“Radiation-burned, Adams realized. The youth, eager to acquire land for a demesne, had gone in too soon; all the rumors, passed back and forth in the idle hours of evening by the worldwide elite, appeared true: it had been far too soon, and physically young David Lantano was suffering.”";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41064.The_Penultimate_Truth
Little Fuzzy;H. Beam Piper;1962;1960;252;4.03;10350;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Aliens', 'Classics', 'Young Adult'];The chartered Zarathustra Company had it all their way. Their charter was for a Class III uninhabited planet, which Zarathustra was, and it meant they owned the planet lock stock and barrel. They exploited it, developed it and reaped the huge profits from it without interference from the Colonial Government. Then Jack Holloway, a sunstone prospector, appeared on the scene with his family of Fuzzies and the passionate conviction that they were not cute animals but little people.;"First published in 1962 and good enough to be nominated for the Hugo Award for best novel in 1963 (Philip K. Dick won that year with The Man in the High Castle) Little Fuzzy by H. Beam Piper makes me wonder how influential this book was in the 60s, not just in science fiction or even in literature, but in the 60s culture. Working well on many levels, this is a fun story about Earth colonists coming into contact with cute little fuzzy bipeds, but also a serious discussion about what it means to be a sentient, thinking individual. And more than that, this may also be read as either an allegory for an individual’s relationship between big business and big government; also for a statement about indigenous people's rights.Many critics have noticed the libertarian themes to this work (Piper was nominated posthumously for the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award for Best Classic Libertarian SF Novel in 1997), but I must observe that big business was cast as the villain early in and it was big government that came in to save the day. Of course, there are plenty of examples of individuals standing up for each other, and doing what's right in spite of possible negative consequences.This has been described as a young adult or juvenile novel. I cannot agree as the characters step out of the 60s drinking like fish and smoking like chimneys, and there is some nefarious suggestions and brutal violence. Perhaps the cute little fuzzies are the origin of this classification, and this makes me wonder about influences on Gremlins and / or the Ewoks.Finally, this could have been an even greater classic. Several times while reading, I thought I had a 5 star vote, but Piper's villains are one dimensional straw men and the denouement is watered down. For these reasons, I will likely read John Scalzi's Fuzzy Nation and check out his Fuzzy ""reboot"". Even that said, this is a fun book and a must read for classic sic-fi fans.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1440148.Little_Fuzzy

But they could not solve the riddle of his past, and at last he had to set out on a perilous quest to Es Toch, the City of the Shining, the Liars of Earth, the Enemy of Mankind.There he would find his true self ... and a universe of danger.;"I really enjoyed this 1967 SF novel by Ursula K. Le Guin, set on a far-future version of Earth. A man stumbles through the forest, his mind a complete blank slate, his eyes alien, golden cat's eyes. He's taken in and taught by a small group of humans, who teach him their language and give him the name of Falk, but eventually he is encouraged to leave and go find out who he really is.And so a dangerous, cross-country journey begins. Earth is sparsely populated by humans who live very simply, reportedly enforced by a conquering group (the Shing) from another planet. But there are layers upon layers of misunderstanding and deception, and it's not clear to Falk (or the reader) until very late in the novel where the truth lies. The ending was great fun, but I really wanted to know What Happened After. And what exactly was up with the main character's cat eyes?While this novel works fine as a stand-alone read, it shares a history with Planet of Exile, and my appreciation for it was definitely enhanced by having read that short novel right before this one. I also had fun trying to parse out where exactly Falk was in his travels through what used to be the United States, based on clues like ""Mzurra"" and ""Arksa"" and ""Inland River."" (Kansas, for whatever reason, has proudly hung onto its name.)A good old-fashioned SF adventure, not as deep as Le Guin's later work, but a great ending bumped up my rating.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201889.City_of_Illusions
Ice;Anna Kavan;1967;1960;158;3.67;9423;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Fantasy', 'Novels'];"In this haunting and surreal novel, the narrator and a man known as the warden search for an elusive girl in a frozen, seemingly post-nuclear, apocalyptic landscape. The country has been invaded and is being governed by a secret organization. There is destruction everywhere; great walls of ice overrun the world. Together with the narrator, the reader is swept into a hallucinatory quest for this strange and fragile creature with albino hair. Acclaimed upon its 1967 publication as the best science fiction book of the year, this extraordinary and innovative novel has subsequently been recognized as a major work of literature in its own right.";"‘I was afraid the dream might turn out to be real…. Something in her demanded victimization and terror, so she corrupted my dreams, led me into dark places I had no wish to explore. It was no longer clear to me which of us was the victim. Perhaps we were victims of one another.Stunningly surreal and chilling, Anna Kavan’s final novel, Ice, is a frightening plunge into the icy darkness of the human mind and heart. Written with a fitful urgency, the reader flows on the glimmering prose across swirling imagery of desolate landscapes beset by an impending apocalypse, as the narrator continuously pursues a woman known only as ‘the girl’ while struggling to anchor himself to the elusive, ever-deteriorating reality. Through spiraling hallucinations and indefinite descriptions, reality becomes nothing but a translucent veil giving shape to the real violent and grim truths that exist only in abstraction. The blurring of reality and unreality that occurs gives these sinister abstractions a staging ground to take form within in order to explore the otherwise unspeakable darkness that leads people to make victims of one another.Nothing in Ice is ever certain or concrete. Characters are not given names and reality is only tasted in fleeting moments, ‘but only as on might recall and incident from a dream.’ Told through the tormented mind of a narrator who—within the first 10 pages—openly admits to suffering from daytime hallucinations, the reader is forced to be led by the hand through this menacing novel by someone they cannot fully trust. Poe’s The Cask of Amontillado and his use of the unreliable narrator immediately come to mind through this narrators vague descriptions and elusive explanations to his afflictions, much like the intentionally unspecified ‘thousand injuries’ in Poe. There is, for instance his explanation of the girl: ‘Systematic bullying when she was most vulnerable had distorted the structure of her personality, made a victim of her, to be destroyed, either by things or by human beings…. It made no difference, in any case she could not escape.’ ¹ Despite being alluded that it was a cruel, obdurate mother that inflicted such psychological injury, there is nothing to ground this to reality and justify his claims. We have only his observations of the girl, much of which may be distorted and our own impression is further distorted as we observe her already believing it to be true and using our glimpses to justify our pre-disposed conclusion instead of constructing our own. The same goes for the slowly creeping apocalypse, a wall of ice ‘marching in relentless order across the world, crushing, obliterating, destroying everything in their path’, the consequence of constant world wars which lead to this new ice age. However, the science behind the ice is only vaguely surmised, more as if playing at a guess, and the reader is occasionally reminded that ‘no reliable source of information existed’. Kavan uses repetition to its glorious, full potential, constantly reminding us of the vague premises to reinforce their believability and tricking us to perceive something formless as concrete.The elusive nature of the novel serves a secondary purpose beyond misdirection, as it allows the reader to experience the story and settings exactly as the narrator sees and comprehends them. The landscapes and the narrative are co-dependent metaphors of one another.’There were many small islands, some of which floated up and became clouds, while formations of cloud or mist descended and anchored themselves in the sea. The white snowy landscape below, and above the canopy of misty white light, the effect of an oriental painting, nothing solid about it. The town appeared to consist of ruins, collapsing on one another in shapeless disorder, a town of sandcastles, wrecked by the tide’The narrators own fractured mind controls our sense of time and reality, and often, and without warning, we are sent into some unreality, some brief fantasy and then dropped back into the plot as if nothing had occurred. ‘The hallucination of one moment did not fit the reality of the next,’ our narrator reflects, ‘I had a curious feeling that I was living on several planes simultaneously; the overlapping was confusing’. As the novel progresses the seamless hallucination sequences aren’t as obvious, and the novel suddenly drives forward at break-neck pace taking us through spy-dramas, courtroom scenes, war-stories and other edge-of-your-seat escape stories that we must ingest whole and wonder where the fantasy and reality may have blurred. Tiny hints of obvious unreality present themselves occasionally, such as producing a ‘foreign automatic weapon’ when one wasn’t present earlier, however, the all we can truly do is hold on tight and enjoy the thrill-ride. Time itself is subject to the narrators own distorted mind, as events are mentioned that he once observed that could not have occurred within the boundaries of time presented in the scenes, and the positioning of the opening scenes is a bit cumbersome to place along the timeline. The narrative almost feels cyclical at times. There are many different methods of addressing these incongruities depending on how the reader interprets the novel, yet it would appear that nothing in the book aims towards one certain conclusion or meaning. Instead, Kavan seems to write to give a wide interpretability because the real issues at play are very abstract and intangible, and it appears she would prefer to keep them that way in order to allot them their full force. Ultimately, depriving the reader of lucidness and conclusiveness brings the uncomfortable, uncertain tone of the novel to life. The surrealist qualities are elevated to near maddening proportions by taking any safe-guards away from the reader and forcing them to grasp desperately at the intangibles.Brick by brick, Kavan builds only one certainty in this novel – the destructive powers of man. ‘An insane impatience for death was driving mankind to a second suicide, even before the full effect of the first had been felt.. Each scene and setting is beleaguered by references to wars past and present, ‘everywhere the ubiquitous ruins, decayed fortifications, evidences of a warlike bloodthirsty past’, and the encroaching ice and it is always at the forefront of the mind that the world is in a perpetual state of violence. This violence is said to be the cause of the icy apocalypse, a world collapsing both figuratively and literally due to mans ‘collective death-wish, the fatal impulse to self-destruction’. Even the response to destruction is more destruction as wars rage on in increasing intensity to match coming end. ‘By making war we asserted the fact that we were alive and opposed the icy death creeping over the globe,’ we are told, the narrator not missing out on the obvious ironies. He looks at the actions of those around him with disgust and dismay, saddened when encountering a violent brute of a man as being ‘the kind of man who was wanted now’ and placing himself in league with a civilized, admirable man that is brutally murdered for no reason saying he ‘was my sort of man, we were not like that rabble’ to distance himself from the bleak violence. Yet, he knows he cannot escape it and is constantly drawn towards the fighting, joining the army for a time believing he ‘was involved with the fate of the planet, I had to take an active part in whatever was going on’. The narrator’s method of misdirection leads one to wonder where his loyalty and morality really lies*.The war-torn, doomed world is a mere backdrop for the evils that play out within arms reach of the narrator as he embarks on his crusade for the girl. ‘I was totally absorbed in that obsessional need, as for a lost, essential portion of my own being,’ he admits, ‘Everything else in the world seemed immaterial’. The real heart of this novel is the relationship with the girl, and the narrator freely declares the world around him as questionable, as a mere veil of reality where he must conduct his search. While the universal message of destruction and more powerful groups such as the warring armies victimizing one another is chilling, Kavan directs us to the more poignant and disturbing victimization one person can inflict upon another, especially one they love. The interplay between the male characters of the husband, the warden, the narrator and their experiences with the girl show an alarming portrait of obsessive, sadistic possession. The girl ceases to be considered an equal human and becomes nothing more than chattel. ‘It was clear that he regarded her as his property. I considered that she belonged to me. Between the two of us she was reduced to nothing her only function might have been to link us together.’These malignant pleasures of victimization are at the core of each scene, real or unreal, and illustrated through the vibrant imagery of each stark landscape which Kavan paints with her words. ‘All of this was happening, but with a quality of the unreal; it was reality happening in quite a different way.’ The surreal plotline becomes a place for her abstract ideas to flicker in and out of physical form but their malevolent nature is too poisonous to exist in glaring reality so reality must fold up and falter in order for them to truly rear their ugly heads. Hallucinations occur so we can look them in the face and make sense out of non-sense, horrific ideas are structured in a way to make them tangible enough to process. The narrator himself cannot even fathom his own depravity, and suffers from unrealities, or projects them onto others because he cannot face the blinding truth². Kavan presents a humanity that deserves the destruction that it receives, and this is the most horrific aspect of the novel. It makes one wonder if they are blind to their own moral deformities, conditioned to accept them as normal because we are so able to rationalize and gloss over the troubling aspects of ourselves. One must question if they are actually some damnable beast writhing in their own bile yet thinking it smells of roses and projecting onto society and those around them their own personal iniquity. What else is truly alarming is the way the victims become conditioned to accept these monstrosities, playing right into the degredation and violence. Kavan seems to admonish this behavior, creating a borderless world of victimization that damns both parties.’In the delirium of the dance, it was impossible to distinguish between the violent and the victims. Anyway, distinction no longer mattered in a dance of death, where all dancers spun on the edge of nothingness.’ It isn’t so much an attack on the victim, as it is an attack on the ways it is so easy to succumb to behavior that can make oneself into a villain.Anna Kavan was known for these startling perspectives on humanity. Her own life is a fascinating story. Born Helen Woods in what was assumed to be Cannes in 1901, she changed her name to Anna Kavan while institutionalized after a nervous breakdown following the end of her second marriage. The name Anna Kavan, the protagonist of her 1930 novel Let Me Alone, brought with it a new personality and writing style. Beyond suffering from mental illness, she was a lifelong heroin addict³. She died in 1968 of heart failure not long after this novel was published, but before dying she burnt all her diaries, correspondence and other links into her private life to ensure that she would become ‘one of the world’s best-kept secrets’. This fascinating woman had an incredible knack for prose and a sharp, disturbing insight into human nature. For readers interested in further insight into Kavan herself, they will be pleased to know that many of her books contain thinly-fictionalized biographical elements. Books like Asylum Piece cover her mental states and time spent in the asylum, Sleep Has His House hints at her sorrowful childhood, and her addiction to heroin and her open disgust of humanity is unapologetically broadcast in her short story collection Julia and the Bazooka.This novel is one of the most unique and engrossing literary events I have encountered. To give it a genre would cheapen the novel, as it both is and isn’t science fiction and horror, being a work of literature as elusive as its own narrative. The prose will surround and penetrate your heart much like the wall of ice in the novel as it builds the gorgeously surreal images to dazzle your mind. The subject matter, and the tone, is bleak and chilling, and exposes a violently disturbing vision of humanity, yet it is a book that you want to hug tightly as you race through the streets yelling to everyone that they should read it. As menacing as a nightmare, yet as soothing as a pleasant daydream, this book scratches an itch that few other books have been able to reach. 4.5/5‘I was oppressed by the sense of universal strangeness, by the chill of approaching catastrophe, the menace of ruins suspended above; and also by the enormity of what had been done, the weight of collective guilt. A frightful crime had been committed, against nature, against the universe, against life. By rejecting life, man had destroyed the immemorial order, destroyed the world; now everything was about to crash down in ruins.’¹ The girl, ‘forced since childhood into a victim’s patter of thought and behavior’, is here further victimized by her lack of name. Although ‘woman’ would be a more age-appropriate term for her, the usage of ‘girl’ is delivered with an extremely negative connotation that implies her as weak, a fragile and innocent ‘glass girl’ with no will of her own. Her physical appearance, pale and frail, is also used to highlight her weak and innocent nature, making the narrators own personal ‘indescribable pleasure from seeing her suffer’ all the more sadistic despite his own assertion that ‘I disapproved of my own callousness, but there it was. Various factors had combined to produce it, though they were not extenuating circumstances’. It would appear the narrator is trying to be upfront (this admission coming right at the beginning of the novel) to gloss over his sadism, but reflection on his word choices reveals the residue of the disturbing truths he is attempting to misdirect the reader from.² It is debatable, but there is strong evidence to indicate that the warden and the narrator are one and the same person. There are moments of half-clarity when the narrator recognizes his own denial and notices the inconsistencies in his fantasy. ‘I seemed to be looking at my own reflexion [sic]. Suddenly I was entangled in utmost confusion about which of us was which, We were like halves of one being, joined in some mysterious symbiosis. I fought to retain my identity.’ The husband may very well be the same character as well. In the introduction, Christopher Priest asserts that the warden and the husband are the same man, but says nothing of the narrator. The multiple interpretative quality of this book is one of its strongest aspects.³ Christopher Priest’s introduction discussed that many critics have unsuccessfully attempted to view the ice as a metaphor for Anna Kavan’s own heroin addiction. This overly self-conscious footnote serves more as an excuse for awkwardly placing the biographical information at the end of the review. The novel is best served by being examined on its own, as the details of the authors life are so engrossing that they easily lead towards the disservice of the Intentional Fallacy, as Priest discusses with the heroin-as-ice metaphor. That said, other novels of hers, particularly Asylum Piece or Sleep Has His House, have been interpreted as being highly-autobiographical. The ice, like much of the symbolism, seems to be reflective of many different ideas, but a corner stone to it's meaning may be the silent and white aspect of it that the narrator frequently mentions. It seems it is a fresh start, a blank, pure whiteness to cover up all the ugly and violent aspects of humanity and himself. He often speaks of how it will end all wars and engulf the earth in silence, a silence he so wishes for because his own actions are unspeakable. He is drowning in his and the worlds evils and wishes for them to be purified in their own destruction.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/636223.Ice

Epic and alluring, this brilliant novel is a mesmerizing depiction of Dick's undying hope in humanity.";"“I'm tired and I want to rest; I want to get out of this and go lie down somewhere, off where it's dark and no one speaks. Forever.”― Philip K. Dick, Dr. Bloodmoney If you’ve watched Ex Machina, you know this is a super-slick film of two young men interacting with a beautiful version of AI, a great work of science fiction with such a streamlined, clear-cut, linear, easy-to-follow storyline, at the opposite end of the spectrum from, well, Philip K. Dick. Case in point: PKD’s Dr. Bloodmoney, the CRAZIEST novel I’ve ever read. Here are ten reasons why:1. Atom BombThe setting is the San Francisco Bay Area. No sooner are we introduced to our main characters in the first and second chapters then a series of Hiroshima-size atomic bombs hit. What remains of the human and non-human populations must deal with the devastation , the PKD-style devastation, that is. 2. Man in SpaceThe US space program shots Walt Dangerfield and his wife up in a rocket to colonize Mars. Bad timing. Immediately after blast-off the bombs hit. But Walt, who has lost his wife and is stuck orbiting Earth, maintains contact; matter of fact, everyone tunes into his hayseed broadcasts to receive updates on global happenings, a weird combination of the nightly news and a version of that old television show Hee Haw. 3. A tiny adult person lives inside Edie KellerIf being a seven-year-old post-nuclear war little girl isn’t tough enough, Edie has tiny brother Bill lodged right inside her, next to her kidney. Bill is a fully matured adult (perhaps the result of nuclear fallout) who can carry on adult conversations with sister Edie.4. Dr. BloodmoneyBruno Bluthgeld aka Jack Tree aka Dr. Bloodmoney is an atomic physicist and paranoid, shape shifter who might very well be responsible for the world-wide nuclear war.5. Dogs that talkDr. Bloodmoney owns a frisky, playful dog who occasionally talks in dog-like growls, a phenomenon accepted by all the survivors as normal and routine after the radioactive fallout.6. The mutants are comingSan Francisco can be a hazardous place to live with such potentially dangerous creatures as mutant winged weasels flying around and splattering themselves on skyscraper windows or anything or anybody else who might be in their way. 7. Less than appealing dietStuart McConchie is an African-American TV salesman who was forced to eat a live rat to survive in the cellar after the bombs hit. Seven years later, Stuart is making his living selling robot-like rat traps. In many ways, if the novel has any foundation in sanity, Stuart is our man.8. The importance of being a horseWith all the modern, sophisticated technology, one aspect of post-bomb life is less than modern: the main mode of transportation is riding a horse. At one point, Stuart McConchie feels great sadness since he had to leave his horse hitched to a pillar under a San Francisco dock. Big mistake: the San Francisco homeless killed and ate his horse.9. The danger of taking a job as a teacherDuring his job interview, Hal Barnes asks the town’s clearing committee what happened to the last teacher. One of the committee members, an older lady by the name of June Robe, tells Hal matter-of-factly that the clearing committee had to kill him.10. Thalidomide BoyI've saved the best for last: Hoppy Harrington is a young man who is a phocomelus, that is, without any hands or legs. Hoppy possesses a wide inventory of psychic powers and mechanical abilities that more than compensate for his physical disabilities. Hoppy appears front-and-center in much of the novel’s action.PKD is actually able to have all this craziness intertwine to construct a riveting, cohesive story. How in the world does he do it? Obviously the author had one of the most powerful and most creative imaginations in history. Also, from what I understand, PKD was known to use tabs of speed to fuel his psychic rocket ship. Again, the craziest novel I’ve ever read.“Imagine being sentient but not alive. Seeing and even knowing, but not alive. Just looking out. Recognizing but not being alive. A person can die and still go on. Sometimes what looks out at you from a person's eyes maybe died back in childhood.”― Philip K. Dick (1928 - 1982) - Judging from the above quote, PKD might still be around!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/636108.Dr_Bloodmoney

While I can understand many feminists dislike of him and of this book in particular, I even winced at some passages, I would remind some that he was progressive minded when he wrote these, and was born in 1907, in Missouri, and attended a very different Naval Academy from the one we know today. This was entertaining, a little thin, but a well played use of science fiction politics and suspense. I thought he did a good job of characterization of Poddy, if not completely three dimensional. I did feel the ending was disappointing and have read some other reviews that concur.Not one of his best, but it's Heinlein so a good SF tale at the end of the day.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50839.Podkayne_of_Mars

They had to be. For their business was murder...It was up to Jason dinAlt, interplanetary gambler, to discover why Pyrrus had become so hostile during man's brief habitation...;A solid 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 for the fabulous memory it evoked. In fact it was so good, that I intend very soon to continue with 2 & 3 which have also survived since 1976. Full review to follow tomorrow 😊The inside sleeve of the book tells me I bought this book on 6th October 1975, obviously with my birthday money (I was 16 a couple of weeks before), and to be honest I think I read it then and not since. (As a slight aside it is unfortunately one of only maybe 20 books that have managed to stay with me through my various house moves).The book is an easy reading roller coaster of a book with the hero Jason getting bashed, battered and bruised through out the whole book before coming good in the end. Is it a classic ? No, but what it is, is a fun read, not too long with a good story, some good characters and a happy ending. As I said, I enjoyed it so much I've checked and the initial 2 sequels also survived my travels and are still with me, so I shall read them as soon as my tight schedule allows.So if you enjoy a bit of escapist fun sci-fi then check out Harry Harrison's Deathworld books;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2037559.Deathworld_1

Nova;Samuel R. Delany;1968;1960;241;3.8;8499;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Classics'];"These are [at least some of] the ways you can read NOVA: as a fast-action farflung interstellar adventure; as archetypal mystical/mythical allegory (in which the Tarot and the Grail both figure prominently); as modern myth told in the S-F idiom... the reader observes, recollects, or participates in a range of personal experience including violent pain and disfigurement, sensory deprivation and overload, man-machine communion, the drug experience, the creative experience - and inter-personal relationships which include incest and assassination, father-son, leader-follower, human-pet, and lots more!The balance of galactic power in the 31st century revolves around Illyrion, the most precious energy source in the universe. The varied and exotic crew who sign up with Captain Lorq van Ray know their mission is dangerous, and they soon learn that they are involved in a deadly race with the charismatic but vicious leader of an opposing space federation. But they have no idea of Lorq's secret obsession: to gather Illyrion at the source by flying through the very heart of an imploding star.";flawed but heroic space captain, on a mission that is part vengeance and part noble quest, assembles a disparate crew to fly through a nova. this is Samuel R. Delany so that synopsis just barely scratches the surface.I'm going to copy & paste a post regarding this book that I just made in a group I moderate. hopefully the pasted post will eventually turn out to be notes for an actual review, but who knows, I'm whimsical. and lazy!Delany's prose reminds me of a couple musicians I like, John Cage and John Zorn. Cage because they both create strange, shimmering beauty out of disparate parts that I wouldn't expect to find beautiful. Zorn because I usually have no idea what is going to come next, what one part will turn into, and what that will turn into next. the music analogy occurred to me fairly early because the futuristic music that the highly endearing character Mouse creates is central to the story.is there hard science in this book? I am not a science guy, not remotely, and a lot of what Delany was describing flew right over my head. so much so that I couldn't tell if it was actual science or if it was Delany using science in a fantastical way.one of the things I often notice when reading science fiction from earlier eras is how much these authors can pack into such a short number of pages. just a bit over 200 pages! and yet Delany successfully develops multiple characters, an entire future society, a revenge narrative, and much else in those pages. very, very impressive. such a small package but so much within.loved the use of tarot cards. I think the only other science fiction I've read that had such heavy use was Piers Anthony's Tarot series. and now I'm a little embarrassed that I've mentioned Piers Anthony. but he had some good novels!I'm a bit shaky on the Grail Quest within this novel. it appears central but at the same time its use was somewhat obscure to me. I have to think on that a little bit, maybe do some research.one of the things I like about New Wave science fiction authors is just how literary they can get. I have no problem with straightforward 'genre prose' but I just really, really love the artistry of more experimental writers who don't handhold readers from point A to B and who treat their prose with a combination of playfulness and seriousness, like it's a fun challenge for them to write what they intend to be a fun challenge to read. reading Delany and others of his ilk is the opposite of a passive experience. it is the kind of a writing that hits many different parts of me at different times and in different ways. exciting prose!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85863.Nova
The Pool of Fire;John Christopher;1968;1960;204;4.0;7694;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Childrens', 'Adventure'];Alternate cover edition can be found here. Will Parker has managed to escape from the City of Gold and Lead, where he served as a slave to one of the Masters who rule the modern world. And He has not only discovered what lies behind the Tripods' power, but also how the Masters heartlessly plan to destroy the earth.;"Okay, but definitely the weakest of the trilogy. Felt more like a summary of how everything got resolved than its own story, and Will is increasingly hard to like. His heedlessness and sulking and self-absorption seem correct when he's thirteen; less understandable (or even believable) when he's in his late teens and chosen for special missions essential to the fate of all humanity. As the characters grow older and interact with a wider range of the populace, the omission of women also becomes more glaring. Not only are no significant characters female, but there hardly even seem to be women in the towns they pass through. In the first book, a story of three boys escaping through the wilderness to freedom, it wasn't a big deal that they didn't meet or think about women, but when they're out recruiting dissidents -- and they explicitly don't recruit women, wtf is up with that?! -- it's a little unnatural. None of these young men ever think about girls? And the aliens are also sexist and only take male slaves while females get preserved as dead display specimens. The alien-fighting plan was pretty dubious, too, I thought. But I guess it would be a crappy ending if the aliens won. Not that the ending was exactly upbeat. It's a sucky world, kids, and people are assholes! Don't get your hopes up too high. Enjoy some hunting and fishing while you have the chance, and avoid women and other aliens.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80491.The_Pool_of_Fire
Now Wait for Last Year;Philip K. Dick;1966;1960;230;3.89;7317;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];Dr. Eric Sweetscent has problems. His planet is enmeshed in an unwinnable war. His wife is lethally addicted to a drug that whips its users helplessly back and forth across time—and is hell-bent on making Eric suffer along with her. And Sweetscent's newest patient is not only the most important man on the embattled planet Earth but quite possibly the sickest. For Secretary Gino Molinari has turned his mortal illness into an instrument of political policy—and Eric cannot tell if his job is to make the man better or to keep him poised just this side of death.Now Wait for Last Year bursts through the envelope between the impossible and the inevitable. Even as it ushers us into a future that looks uncannily like the present, it makes the normal seem terrifyingly provisional—and compels anyone who reads it to wonder if he really knows what time it is.;"Welcome to the science fiction world of Philip K. Dick’s 1966 novel Now Wait for Last Year. We are plunged into the teeth of a mid-twenty-first century interplanetary war: Lillistar, (human-like beings with superhuman strength) vs reggs (human-size semi-mechanical bugs). Just so happens Terra (Planet Earth) is also a potential big player in the outer space battles. The husband and wife team of Kathy and Eric Sweetscent are the novel's main characters. Kathy occupies a key upper-echelon post at TF&D, a San Diego based company manufacturing wiring for interplanetary spacecraft with subsidiaries in cities like Detroit, a company that also develops powerful drugs (ah, still so much money to be made from drugs by companies in the US!). Dr. Eric Sweetscent, a surgeon performing futuristic implants, also occupies a top slot at TF&D.Additionally, the novel contains three highlights worthy of a special call-out: 1) robots engaged in various activities and occupations, including cab drivers who zip around in flying cabs; 2) political intrigue with a particular focus on Gino Molinari, supreme leader of Terra, a man who makes a habit of failing health just at the right moment; and, most dramatically, 3) JJ-180, a powerful, instantly addictive, toxic drug with very strange properties. One user tells Kathy that JJ - 180 alters one’s sense of time so that it should be called a tempogogic drug instead of a hallucinogenic drug, however, as we find out after Kath and later Eric take the drug, JJ – 180 does much more: the pill popper is propelled into the future or into the past.Ah, JJ- 180, bender of time. It is this drug-induced time-travel that is the most fascinating aspect of the novel. For example, here is Eric under the influence of the drug: “Eric confronted a face which he had seen many times and yet it was distorted now, witnessed from a weird angle, as if inside out, pulled through infinity. The man’s hair was parted on the wrong side so that his head seemed lopsided, wrong in all its lines. What amazed him was the physical unattractiveness of the man. He was too fat and a little too old. Unpleasantly gray. It was a shock to see himself like this, without preparation; do I really look like that? He asked himself morosely.” I suspect most of us would have a similar reaction if we encountered our twenty year older self on the street.There is never a dull moment. The novel’s action is fast-paced and told in crisp, staccato, hard-boiled language similar to James M. Cain, Charles Bukowski or Jim Thompson. And all the science fiction elements are combined in crazy combinations. Time travel has been around for decades – H.G. Well’s The Time Machine published in 1895 and the first novel of alien abduction was Jean de La Hire’s 1908 novel, The Fiery Wheel. But with PKD the science fiction imagination kicked into overdrive. Perhaps the place and time (the US in the 1960s); perhaps common use of new drugs (speed, meth, LSD), perhaps the political climate (Gotta revolution!), but whatever the reason, reading this PKD novel is nothing less than a literary acid trip.Also, there is a good bit of social commentary. For example, Eric makes many social and cultural observations as explores the streets and peoples of Tijuana, Mexico. “A girl during daylight hours on the streets of Tijuana dressed with incomprehensible smartness: high heels, angora sweater, shiny purse, gloves, coat over her shoulders, preceded, as she hurried, by high, sharp-as-tacks breasts, the smartness carrying even to the detail of her modern bra. What did these girls do for a living? Where had they learned to dress so well, not to mention the problem of financing such a wardrobe?”Through the effects of JJ – 180, knowing what the future holds for him personally and what will happen to his wife Kathy, Eric faces hard ethical choices. Why continue living when there will be so much pain? How much do all his future selves depend on the decisions he makes in the present? What is his ultimate responsibility to Kathy and to himself? By way of this time-bending drug, PKD explores the moral dimensions of our all-too-human existence. Now Wait for Last Year isn’t as well-known as some of his other novels but perhaps it should be.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216378.Now_Wait_for_Last_Year

The surface story tells of the problems a member of an alien race, Lo Lobey, has assimilating the mythology of earth, where his kind have settled among the leftover artifacts of humanity. The deeper tale concerns, however, the way those who are ""different"" must deal with the dominant cultural ideology. The tale follows Lobey's mythic quest for his lost love, Friza. In luminous and hallucinated language, it explores what new myths might emerge from the detritus of the human world as those who are ""different"" try to seize history and the day.";"Samuel R. Delany: scifi master, queer black boundary-crosser, critic and outsider, beloved cult figure, college professor, poet, genius.i had a hard time with this one at first, and gave up about a third of the way in. i didn't understand what was happening and i resented the novel - it confused and frustrated me. but then i rallied, mainly due to a flash of shame at thinking that i needed my novels to be spoon-fed to me, with traditional narratives, easy answers and easily digested themes, familiar characters, obvious points to be made, the kind of simplicity that makes a novel a pleasant vacation. that's not me! i want those vacations, but i also want challenging (and ultimately exhilarating) experiences. so i swallowed my boring desire to have things carefully explained to me, and jumped back in. i'm glad i did. The Einstein Intersection is a wonderful and mind-expanding book, well worth the effort a reader puts into it.there is fun and intrigue in figuring out what is happening, so i will spoilerize most of my synopsis: far, far, far in the extremely far future, village herder & musician Lobey goes on an Orpheus-like quest for his slain lover... as the novel progresses, the reader comes to understand that the beings on this surprisingly verdant future-earth are aliens who have inherited human bodies. the humans themselves have left, or at least their consciousness have transcended to some great beyond, leaving their bodies and all of their works behind. these new humans must wrestle with genetics and the need to breed viable children, their original 3-gender existence, the human legacy itself - running the gamut from myths to music to old hollywood films to radiation - both positive and negative in impact, and their own mysterious potential. things are changing on this farflung earth: strange new abilities are developing and radically new ways of living must be learned; true understanding of their own natures must take place for progression to happen. ...along the way he meets the very complicated badass Spider, the sweet and nonchalant prince-in-exile Greeneye, the chameleonic object of everyone's desire Dove, and Lobey's terrible nemesis, architect of his quest: the vicious, scheming, mocking, murderous little red-haired psychic child, Kid Death.the novel is about identity and difference... music and pop culture... great potential and great change... death and un-death... love and hate... city vs. country... sex and procreation... the author's own story and his personal goals in writing... how myths can control history and how new myths can be made, old myths transformed... it is about a quest to conquer death and to understand the nature of life. Delany's writing takes the jazzy, loose-limbed, seemingly improvisational New Wave SciFi approach as a launching point... and so the language can take the form of flat and resolutely masculine commentary pitched straight down the middle, and then shift effortlessly into iridescent bubbles of delicate prose, blown from a child's toy. Lobey is an appealingly down-to-earth protagonist, a backwoods country hayseed abroad in both open spaces and treacherous city... and he is also a nearly unknowable being, clear in motive yet obscure and mysterious in his strange abilities and potential to change the world around him and perhaps the future itself. the novel manages to be so many things at different times, and sometimes all at once: sardonic, wise, nihilistic, hopeful, ambiguous, concrete... creepily inexplicable and perfectly rational. it is a marvelously unique experience.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145354.The_Einstein_Intersection

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy;Douglas Adams;1979;1970;216;4.23;1882433;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"Seconds before the Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who, for the last fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor.Together this dynamic pair begin a journey through space aided by quotes from The Hitchhiker's Guide (""A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have"") and a galaxy-full of fellow travelers: Zaphod Beeblebrox--the two-headed, three-armed ex-hippie and totally out-to-lunch president of the galaxy; Trillian, Zaphod's girlfriend (formally Tricia McMillan), whom Arthur tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone; Marvin, a paranoid, brilliant, and chronically depressed robot; Veet Voojagig, a former graduate student who is obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens he bought over the years.Where are these pens? Why are we born? Why do we die? Why do we spend so much time between wearing digital watches? For all the answers stick your thumb to the stars. And don't forget to bring a towel!";"In my experience, readers either love Adams' books or quickly put them down. I, for example, quite literally worship the words Adams puts on the page, and have read the Hitchhiker's Trilogy so many times that I have large tracts of it memorized. But both my wife and father couldn't get past book one: the former because she found it too silly, and the latter because he found the writing to be more about ""the author's personality"" than plot and character. Whatever.The first three books in the Hitchhiker's Trilogy--The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and Life, the Universe and Everything--are inspired lunacy. The ideas, plots, puns, jokes, and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers, but people from all fields. For instance: the Babel Fish software that translates foreign websites for you is named after a species of fish that Adams created in book one; you can find dozens of recipes online for Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters; the chess computer Deep Thought that lost two matches to Gary Kasparov in 1989 was named after a computer in book one; and seriously, who hasn't heard that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42? (For more of these, consult wikipedia.org's entry on ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cultural References"".) Chances are, if you're reading these books for the first time, you'll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after Adams' creations.The books aren't, of course, without their problems. Adams himself admitted that the Trilogy had, and I paraphrase, a long beginning, a long conclusion, and not much in the middle (though I can't remember where I read that). He was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out one-liners. The books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines, and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics. Despite this, the Hitchhiker's Trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books I've ever read--a position they've occupied for some fifteen years. Adams' wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness, and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly, consistently make me howl with laughter (the other being Terry Pratchett). Readers beware: if the Adams bug infects you, you will have it for life. And you'll never be sorry you let it bite.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy
The Stand;Stephen         King;1978;1970;0;4.35;777124;no;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Thriller', 'Dystopia'];First came the days of the plague. Then came the dreams. Dark dreams that warned of the coming of the dark man. The apostate of death, his worn-down boot heels tramping the night roads. The warlord of the charnel house and Prince of Evil. His time is at hand. His empire grows in the west and the Apocalypse looms.For hundreds of thousands of fans who read The Stand in its original version and wanted more, this new edition is Stephen King's gift. And those who are listening to The Stand for the first time will discover a triumphant and eerily plausible work of the imagination that takes on the issues that will determine our survival.;"As soon as Chinese New Year got cancelled, I knew coronavirus was serious. Then the virus spread just like viruses do in every horror novel. So much so, in fact, that my immediate first thought was not to stock up on bottled water and toilet paper, but that it's finally time to read 
The Stand.
Naturally I'm a Stephen King superfan, so it's strange I hadn't yet read what is commonly considered his magnum opus. In the back of my mind I knew there would be a right time to read it. I thought it might be after King's death (rue the day) or after reading everything else by him. As a way to fully compare it to the rest of his oeuvre. Clearly, however, a once-in-a-100-years pandemic was the sign I was looking for. This is it, folks. It's time.As it turned out...maybe not the best idea. After seven months of living through this, there's a level of new normalcy. But in those early days, during constant uncertainty, seeing nearly 4,000 Americans die daily, entire nursing homes wiped out, entire families...it was scary as hell. Reading a scary book during a scary time isn't nearly as fun as it sounds.I kept a reading journal throughout this time. Partly because I wanted to remember my reactions throughout such an enormous read, but also to monitor my mental state during a pandemic. Much of my journal entries relate to bad dreams, reactions to the news, or just keeping up with the death count. Many times Stephen King's world was a close parallel to the real world, resulting in much anxiety and much admiration for a writer capable of prophecy.Here's the full, unabridged copy of my The Stand review journal:01/27/2020 - What better time to see what The Stand is all about than during a global coronavirus pandemic? Given this book's epic length, I’m going to do a review journal with spoiler-free reactions over the many months I suspect it will take me to finish.Three chapters in, and of course I’m hooked. Would expect nothing less from King. It may be a big ass book, but he doesn’t wait around to get started. For this rollercoaster, you skip the line and sit right up front. Clickity-clank, clickity-clank, then a straight drop. If the rest of the ride is this intense, and the coronavirus doesn’t kill me first, I’m going to be one frazzled mess by the end.02/11/2020 - I've been reading this a while, but only at 10%. My main thought right now is that it's entirely unfair for Stephen King, probably writing most of this while still in his 20s, to be this good. Old characters, female characters, rich, poor--they all come across so real it's startling. How can one mind comprehend so much? How does he articulate it so well? He builds this terrifying world one person at a time and it's so much scarier that way. I'm in awe.In other news, over 1,000 deaths have been attributed to the coronavirus. That's approximately 2-3% death rate for those infected. Better than the 99% death rate in The Stand, so there's a bright side. Of course, there are Internet rumors circulating that China is under-reporting and the real count is significantly higher.02/28/2020 - Up to 15%. Starting to question my logic that reading this during a pandemic will make it more fun. I became physically disturbed last night while reading in bed. Like, on the brink of a panic attack. It's all getting too real. The careful pacing particularly. Stephen King, prophet that he is, describes our current world too well. One case spreads to ten, to fifty, to a thousand. The government doing all it can to prevent blame, to avoid panic. Of course that's making it worse.For historical reference, what's going on right now is that there are more coronavirus cases outside of ground zero China than in. Last I heard that includes 56 countries, with rates rising every day. Other than China, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Japan seem to have it the worst. The W.H.O. just raised its risk assessment from ""high"" to ""very high,"" which is their most extreme rating outside of declaring an outright pandemic. Saying the world is under pandemic essentially succumbs to the realization that the virus is unstoppable and everyone on the planet will eventually be exposed.The death rate for the coronavirus is somewhere between 2-3%. I calculate that 2% of the world population is 154 million.There's also been a case where someone previously ""cured"" of the coronavirus caught it a second time.At home, our president has censored the CDC from making any announcements about the virus without approval by the vice president. When asked why the stock market is tanking, he blamed the recent Democratic debate.Still unclear which is scarier right now, Stephen King's novel or reality.03/03/2020 - have to share this frightening quote from the book before I forget:The President is scheduled to speak tonight at 6:00 PST and his press secretary, Hubert Ross, has branded reports that the President will speak from a set mocked up to look like the Oval Office but actually deep in the White House bunker “hysterical, vicious, and totally unfounded.” Advanced copies of the President’s speech indicate that he will “spank” the American people for overreacting, and compare the current panic to that which followed Orson Welles’s “War of the Worlds” radio broadcast in the early 30s.03/13/2020 - It's a misty Friday the 13th. I'm reading The Stand on my break, which happens to be at home now. The office is still open, but we've been instructed to work from home for the unforeseeable future. This doesn't come as a surprise since nearly all gatherings have been cancelled. Talk shows are without an audience, theme parks are closed, movie releases are all delayed. The upcoming presidential debate has been relocated to avoid cross-country travel. Entire countries are on lockdown.It's all playing out eerily similar to Stephen King's doomsday scenario. The book, so far, has been a crystal ball for what happens next. Within hours of reading a passage where King's president delivers a cough-filled address stating that virus concerns are blown out of proportion and a vaccine will be delivered next week, Mr. Trump appears in the oval office and assures all Americans will have access to testing and free medical treatment. Surprise, surprise, both presidents lied.What's still to be determined is just how deadly this virus is. On one hand you have 22 dead in a single Seattle nursing home, but on the other it's been suggested that hundreds of thousands of infected people are running around who don't even know it because they don't have symptoms or they aren't serious. It seems like either way I'm not personally at high risk, but I am worried about those who are.These are certainly interesting times, to say the least.03/19/2020 - Today marks my first full week of not leaving the house. There's little incentive to at this point. Movie theaters, restaurants, and book stores are all closed. And even if they weren't, the risk of getting COVID-19 isn't worth the reward. Fortunately we saw this coming and our house is stocked with food, water and other essentials. I'm thinking we can last another two weeks before needing to venture out again.Being honest, I've struggled to pick up The Stand as of late. King usually delivers a delicious dose of escapism disaster, but under the circumstances it's all hitting too close to home. Like reading Cujo while living with a rabid dog.I also think the last few chapters have been really boring, though. I'm at 26%, which probably translates to page 350ish, and the most recent characters have really snoozed the action. I know I still have a bazillion pages to go so I'll hold off before giving final judgement, but in this present state I wouldn't call it his best work. Of course this wouldn't be the first time that a King book had a lengthy lull before launching back into life-changing thrills.We'll see how I feel after another week. Hopefully I'll have better things to say about The Stand, and will not have yet descended into madness.03/28/2020 - The Stand did get good again. I’m at 35%. Been reading faster than normal because I have this conspiracy in my head that the coronavirus will finally end the day I finish reading this book. Unfortunately, even at my current pace, that might be several more months. I’m trying, world, I’m trying! LolAs for current affairs, today is sadly noteworthy because over 2,000 people have officially died from COVID-19 in the United States. Just two days ago we hit 1,000 dead. The way things are going, it’s very realistic for those numbers to continue doubling every few days.The virus itself is still somewhat mysterious. Is it airborne? Kinda yes, kinda no. How long can it stay on surfaces? Several days...ish. Can you get it from touching cardboard boxes? Maybe? Will warmer weather do any good? Don’t count on it. Who can you trust? No one, of course, because even the seemingly-healthy can spread it all around.The president expects everything to be fixed in a few weeks so churches can be packed on Easter Sunday. We’d all get a good laugh out of a comment like that, except the situation is too dire.What else has been going on? So much I can’t even keep track. The government somehow came up with $2,000,000,000,000+ to infuse the economy, save businesses and give people enough money to hopefully keep the lights on. Pretty cool, I guess, but I think we’re all wondering what will happen next if this goes on for several more months.A number of celebrities and politicians have caught the virus, some have died from it. A grim reminder that this really does impact everyone. You can’t buy your way out of this mess.04/16/2020 - Future me, whenever you decide to re-read The Stand (which I’m sure you will at some point) remember that the end of “Book 1” gets boring. But don’t give up, because the adventure really starts with “Book 2.” There’s a lot of direct homage to The Wizard of Oz, like there is in The Dark Tower series. Slightly cheesy, I suppose, but Oz is up there among the great quest novels so it’s worthy. And like Oz, King populates his journey with unexpected characters who become close to your heart. You’ll fear for them, and really hope they don’t die—even though in the back of your mind you suspect they will.Hopefully you won’t live to see another global pandemic, but if you do—don’t read The Stand during it. You will be tempted, because it is perhaps the definitive literary achievement of pandemic stories, but it won’t make you feel better. It will make you feel worse.If it’s been 19 days since you last updated your review/blog, remember that looking back at what’s happened in the world will be depressing. For example, 19 days ago only 1,000 Americans were documented as succumbing to the virus. Now that number is 34,000 and growing rapidly. Globally, there’s been 144,341 deaths. These numbers include only those who were officially counted, of course. The world is unfair, and you know that there are many more who society didn’t deem important enough to be included in the statistics.One good thing about revisiting The Stand will be recognizing that no matter how horrible your current political situations are, remember that most political situations are horrible. In the 1970s, King imagined a president who refused to take any responsibility for the handling of a pandemic. Had King’s president lived long enough for the other branches of government to approve stimulus checks, there’s no doubt he would have demanded that those checks bear his name. Situations change, but people generally don’t.If you are absolutely determined to re-read The Stand during another pandemic, remember that it’s okay to take a break and read other books before coming back to it. I recommend gothic romances. They're a good melodramatic distraction from all the real drama swirling around.05/06/2020 - What’s life like during a pandemic? I suppose people will ask years from now. For me, at least, the staying at home part isn’t bad. Where there’s books and Internet, I’m good. I’m still employed (from home) and taking online classes, so too busy to let staying in every night be oppressive.That said, I still find myself suddenly panic-stricken. The smallest thing sends me a spiraling. Planning a birthday party and realizing it’s impossible amid a swirl of uncertainty. Will I still have a job in six months? Will it be safe to travel? Will the next wave of virus be even worse? Will I be dead by then—what about my family?Other things too. Watching a movie where people happily interact can be an escape, or a grim reminder that those moments were the before times—times we may never see again.Are my panic attacks unwarranted? Probably. Mostly. But how can I be sure?Even if we do eventually return to normal, what’s the long-term psychological impact? Can I ever attend a concert or visit an amusement park without imagining a plague of death in the air?The new developments haven’t been reassuring. It’s not just flu-like symptoms; the virus causes blood clots which can lead to fatal strokes. The strain that’s out now is more severe than the original strain. Maybe you get it once and you have antibodies, maybe you can get it an unlimited number of times. The official death toll continues to rise to terrifying numbers, but they’re also saying the virus could have gone global as early as December 2019. How many COVID deaths haven't been counted? Hundreds? Thousands?By the way, says some government leaders, we believe this virus was manufactured in a Chinese lab. Great. What does that mean? Was China reckless? Was this intentional and we have a nuclear war to look forward to?Oh, and murder hornets.Ugh!Anyway, back to The Stand. I’ll admit to still reading slowly. It’s good. Really good. But I can only handle small doses at a time. King is revving up to create the ultimate Good vs. Evil battle. Stakes of Biblical proportions. I still got about 500 pages to read, but I can see why people find that aspect of it appealing. I’m not convinced it’s Top 5 King material yet, but I’m willing to let the adventure roll on and be convinced otherwise.06/04/2020 - Dreams play an important role in The Stand. Survivors of the super flu dream both of holy Mother Abigail and evil Randall Flagg, but where their sympathies lie determines their allegiance.Since the beginning of the pandemic I’ve had my own reoccurring nightmares. All of them some variation on the same theme: impending doom.***Goodreads Word Limit Reached, read the rest

Kindred;Octavia E. Butler;1979;1970;288;4.3;230661;no;['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'Classics', 'Historical'];The visionary author’s masterpiece pulls us—along with her Black female hero—through time to face the horrors of slavery and explore the impacts of racism, sexism, and white supremacy then and now.Dana, a modern Black woman, is celebrating her 26th birthday with her new husband when she is snatched abruptly from her home in California and transported to the antebellum South. Rufus, the white son of a plantation owner, is drowning, and Dana has been summoned to save him. Dana is drawn back repeatedly through time to the slave quarters, and each time the stay grows longer, more arduous, and more dangerous until it is uncertain whether or not Dana’s life will end, long before it has a chance to begin.;"“The ease. Us, the children… I never realized how easily people could be trained to accept slavery.”
Butler is an author that constantly pops up on ""Best sci-fi"" and ""Must-Read African American authors"" lists and I can finally see why. This book may be my first by her, but it won't be my last. Kindred is a fascinating, horrific journey through a dark time in American history, combining eye-opening historical research with time travel.I suppose some modern readers will want to compare this story to Outlander and there are some similarities - a woman trying to survive in the past, lots of blood-soaked history and horror, the harsh realities of being who you are in that time - but not only did this book come first, but it is far more distressing, more tied in with historical truth, and way more about surviving than it is about lusty scenes with a kilted hot dude.It's a really important ""what if"" book about race. What if a modern black woman suddenly found herself transported 150+ years into the past, right into the centre of the antebellum South? The book doesn't shy away from portraying the realities of that (nothing is sugar-coated, be prepared for some upsetting scenes). But it's also more than a gruesome look at historical racism and violence. There are many complex and interesting characters - both slaves and slave owners. Butler has written a book that goes deeper than surface level, exploring how people come to accept slavery as the norm and to justify poor treatment of slaves. Dana is horrified how easy it is. And so was I.Kindred is so good because, not only is it well-written and emotionally effective, but it also manages to be several different important things: complex historical-fiction, intriguing science-fiction, and a memoir of slavery. For a novel so obviously fictional, it feels very real and true. Maybe because, sadly, most of it is. I know this is one book that will stay with me for a long time.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60931.Kindred
Children of Dune;Frank Herbert;1976;1970;609;3.96;206897;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera'];Book three in Frank Herbert's magnificent Dune Chronicles--one of the most significant sagas in the history of literary science fiction.The Children of Dune are twin siblings Leto and Ghanima Atreides, whose father, the Emperor Paul Muad'Dib, disappeared in the desert wastelands of Arrakis nine years ago. Like their father, the twins possess supernormal abilities--making them valuable to their manipulative aunt Alia, who rules the Empire in the name of House Atreides.Facing treason and rebellion on two fronts, Alia's rule is not absolute. The displaced House Corrino is plotting to regain the throne while the fanatical Fremen are being provoked into open revolt by the enigmatic figure known only as The Preacher. Alia believes that by obtaining the secrets of the twins' prophetic visions, she can maintain control over her dynasty.But Leto and Ghanima have their own plans for their visions--and their destinies....Includes an introduction by Brian Herbert;The Dune series is remarkable in that each sequel gets progressively worse until it's unreadable. The first book is truly excellent. It's mantra on fear alone makes it great. The second book a very good sci-fi novel. The third book is merely okay.The fourth book is sub-par, but still interesting.The fifth book is a pain in the ass to read.The sixth book will leave you concerned about the author's health, so terribad is the writing.But hey, the first book kicks ass!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44492286-children-of-dune
The Long Walk;Richard Bachman;1978;1970;370;4.08;194683;no;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Thriller', 'Science Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy'];"Against the wishes of his mother, sixteen-year-old Ray Garraty is about to compete in the annual grueling match of stamina and wits known as The Long Walk. One hundred boys must keep a steady pace of four miles per hour without ever stopping... with the winner being awarded ""The Prize""—anything he wants for the rest of his life. But, as part of this national tournament that sweeps through a dystopian America year after year, there are some harsh rules that Garraty and ninety-nine others must adhere to in order to beat out the rest. There is no finish line—the winner is the last man standing. Contestants cannot receive any outside aid whatsoever. Slow down under the speed limit and you're given a warning. Three warnings and you're out of the game—permanently...";"If this book does not make you feel physical pain, I don't know what will.This isn't a book about killer clowns or haunted hotels. It's not a Hunger Games type of book, despite the ""game show"" element of the Long Walk, nor is it a world attached to any tower, Dark or not. This book is in-your-face and physical, while simultaneously never losing that dreamy, philosophic quality of existenstial fiction. The premise of the book is very simple: Every year, 100 boys enter a contest called the Long Walk, and the winner gets all his heart desires. Each contestant has to maintain a pace of 4 miles per hour or more, or else he gets a warning. If the boy who gets the warning can keep walking 4 miles per hour or faster for the next hour, the warning is revoked. However, if the boy collects three warnings, the next time he slows down, he's shot in the head and out of the game.I love this book, but it's really hard to communicate what I think it's trying to relate. As I'm writing this review, I'm desperately trying to organize my jumbled thoughts. The best I could do is to divide the book into two sections that broadly describe which parts of this book stood out to me the most: The Deeper Meaning (as I see it) & How it's Done and The People.
The Deeper Meaning (as I see it) & How It's Done
The physical aspect of the journey immediately comes to the spotlight. You think you can outwalk 99 boys? Well, despite the 100% chance of someone actually doing it, you're 99% going to be the one to die either from exhaustion or carelessness. The story's downward spiral from the optimism of the first 10 hours to the torturous hell that is the last 10 hours is slow, relentless, and ultimately certain. Some of the boys' death were incredibly cringe worthy, not because their death was bizarre or fantastic, but because it's so damn relatable. I can't relate to a woman running away from her ghost-possessed husband as much as I can imagine my legs giving out after hours of walking in my own blood and pus. But what's extraordinary about this novel is despite its physicality and its real grit, it's very spiritual and contemplative. Ultimately, this book questions what it means to live through the eyes of one boy (and 99 others) who are walking right into the arms of death. As the boys break down physically, their minds deconstruct past the point of madness until they become lifeless, soulless automatons. I think it's at this point, when the boys are broken beyond exhaustion, that King really questions the value of life in the midst of such suffering, and how we push beyond sanity to sustain life. King doesn't point at authority or paternal figures to place blame on how extraordinary and torturous this desire to live can be. It's the walker who chooses to go on the Long Walk that, in the end, leads to death, no matter what we do. And life isn't nice. It won't slow down for you. Got blisters on your feet? Tough. Can't climb that hill after walking +24 hours? You'd better. Got to take a shit? If it takes longer than three warnings, you're going to die with your pants around your ankles. It seems, in this light, that life is much crueler than death. 
The People
Ah, the other great part about this book--and what makes this book so amazing! Unlike many of King's works, this book is not atmospheric. With the exception of comments about the weather and the terrain (obvious factors to consider when walking quite literally until death), the entire narrative is solely focused on the Long Walk itself and the people who are a part of it. I was hesitant to shelf this book under ""dystopian"" because I don't really know if it's a dystopia. All I know is that the Major, whoever he is, seems to be in charge (how much, I don't know) and the Long Walk is something celebrated by everyone who doesn't partake in it. All we get to know is Garraty, the main character in the story, and the other boys he meets in the Long Walk. None of these characters are forgettable. Garraty, McVries, and even Barkovitch are some of the most developed, fleshed out characters that I've had the pleasure of reading. The boys' interactions, teetering between the desire for the other to die and genuine camaraderie, were incredibly complex and touching. Whenever I read about a gunshot, I desperately hoped that it wasn't one of the boys that I knew because they were so real and likeable. Amid the hardship and torture, something about this book was very sincere, and despite what King may have intended, characters like McVries and Garraty made the journey extraordinarily...enjoyable, if not more emotionally painful. This book is something that will always remain in my mind. Not only was the writing engaging and visceral, but it struck a chord deep within me. Some people may not enjoy the book. It's raw, painful, and depressing. But on the other hand, it challenges, breaks, and strips bare the human soul, and ultimately the sympathy such an act invokes is an intense experience.5.0 stars and highly recommended!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9014.The_Long_Walk
Rendezvous with Rama;Arthur C. Clarke;1973;1970;243;4.12;170301;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Novels', 'Classics'];At first, only a few things are known about the celestial object that astronomers dub Rama. It is huge, weighing more than ten trillion tons. And it is hurtling through the solar system at an inconceivable speed. Then a space probe confirms the unthinkable: Rama is no natural object. It is, incredibly, an interstellar spacecraft. Space explorers and planet-bound scientists alike prepare for mankind's first encounter with alien intelligence. It will kindle their wildest dreams... and fan their darkest fears. For no one knows who the Ramans are or why they have come. And now the moment of rendezvous awaits — just behind a Raman airlock door.;"It's odd to think that this book was published 40 years ago. I don't know why that strikes me as strange, but it does.... It's tempting for me to call this book ""Traditional Science Fiction."" Or ""Classic Science Fiction"" or something along those lines. But what I really mean to say is that this is a story where the science is one of the central aspects of the story. The basic premise of the story is: In the future, humanity finds a alien spacecraft and investigates it. A lot of the joy of exploration comes from the theory of how a spaceship might really work in terms of physics. How could you generate gravity on a spaceship? How would it travel? What would the aliens be like? What would the purpose of these various pieces of the ships be? (Such as, for example, a large body of water, or featureless buildings on an island?It's an interesting story, but probably *mostly* interesting for people interested in the genuine science of interstellar/interplanetary travel.For example, if you enjoyed The Martian, you have a good chance of liking this book. (But be warned, the pacing is much different than The Martian. It's not First Person. It's not conversational. It's not painfully technical, but it was written in a different age.Of particular interest to me was the fact that many of the smaller plot arcs of the books were very short. By which I mean to say that when a problem arises in the story, the resolution comes very soon afterwards. That limits the tension of the story somewhat, as you don't have time to get too worried over anything before it's fixed. Lastly, it's important to note that this book ends with many questions unanswered. But the good news is that there are two more books in the series that will explore those questions further, and I trust Clarke to pay me off with good answers by the end of the series.***Later edit: I read the sequel, and I have to retract my previous statement. The follow-up book severely damaged my opinion of this book to the point where I don't know if I would reccomend it any more.So if you were considering reading this book based on my review, you might want to read this first in order to get the whole story... https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537.Rendezvous_with_Rama
The Forever War;Joe Haldeman;1974;1970;278;4.14;169800;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'War', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Military Fiction'];"The Earth's leaders have drawn a line in the interstellar sand—despite the fact that the fierce alien enemy that they would oppose is inscrutable, unconquerable, and very far away. A reluctant conscript drafted into an elite Military unit, Private William Mandella has been propelled through space and time to fight in the distant thousand-year conflict; to perform his duties without rancor and even rise up through military ranks. Pvt. Mandella is willing to do whatever it takes to survive the ordeal and return home. But ""home"" may be even more terrifying than battle, because, thanks to the time dilation caused by space travel, Mandella is aging months while the Earth he left behind is aging centuries.";This book is a military style space opera with …..Wait! Where are you going? Get back here. I hadn’t got to the good part yet. Give me a second to explain. Geez…OK, so yes, there is an interstellar war with human troops in high-tech armored suits battling an alien enemy on distant planets. I know it sounds like another version of Starship Troopers or countless other bad genre sci-fi tales that copied it, but this one is different. Hell, when it was published in 1975 it won the Hugo, the Locus and the Nebula awards for best novel so you know it’s gotta be pretty decent.William Mandella has been drafted as one of the first troops that will be sent to fight the Taurans. There are points in space called collapsers that are like wormholes that will transport your ship to a distant area in the universe instantly, and humanity is fighting the Taurans to use them. Both races like to build bases on nearby planets to establish control of the area around the collapsers. Unfortunately, most of the planets out there aren’t anything like what we’re used to seeing in Star Wars. They’re usually cold lifeless rocks, and just training to use their suits in these environments is dangerous, let alone trying to fight an alien race they know little about. Mandella gets through training and manages to survive the first battle with the Taurans. That’s where the book gets really interesting.While the collapsers provide instant space travel, the ships still have to get to the nearest one and that means months of travel at near light-speed. It turns out that Einstein was right about relativity and traveling at near the speed of light makes time do some funky things. So while the troops on the ship feel like a journey only took months, years have passed for everyone else. When Mandella returns to Earth after his first battle, he’s only aged two years, but ten years have passed on Earth.Since Mandella has to do more and more light speed journeys, centuries pass on Earth even though it’s only been a few years for him. Mandella will return from missions to find that humanity has changed so much that he has almost nothing in common with the rest of the people, and since he manages to survive several campaigns when almost everyone else dies, he’s quickly becoming one of the oldest men in the universe during his ten year (subjective) enlistment.Another quirk of the time differences is that when the humans meet the Taurans, they can’t know if they’re battling alien troops who are centuries ahead or behind them in terms of military intelligence and weapons technology. So Mandella and his fellow soldiers may have a huge advantage or be severely outgunned. It just depends on if the Taurans they’re fighting started their light-speed journeys before or after they did.As the war drags on for century after century, it is both sustaining and draining Earth’s economy. Mandella finds himself losing all his family, his friends and his lovers to war or age. He is increasingly out of touch with Earth and the rest of humanity. The army continues to promote him, mainly because his seniority has reached ridiculous levels after centuries of service.One of the things that isolates Mandella is that homosexuality becomes the norm due to Earth overpopulation. In an ironic reversal of don’t ask-don’t tell, Mandella is the outcast that disgusts many of his fellow soldiers due to his unenlightened ways. Even the slang spoken by other soldiers becomes incomprehensible to him. Increasingly lonely and out of sync with everyone around him with almost no chance of surviving his enlistment, Mandella nurses the hope that the war will someday end during the large gaps of time he skips as he travels to his assignments.Joe Haldeman is a Vietnam vet, and this is an obvious allegory for that war with a weary soldier stuck in a seemingly endless conflict and realizing that even if he makes it home, he won’t fit in to the world he left. While Haldeman’s science and military background gives the book its detail and depth, it’s the tragedy of Mandella’s predicament that makes it a sci-fi classic.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21611.The_Forever_War
The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia;Ursula K. Le Guin;1974;1970;387;4.25;130254;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction'];Shevek, a brilliant physicist, decides to take action. He will seek answers, question the unquestionable, and attempt to tear down the walls of hatred that have isolated his planet of anarchists from the rest of the civilized universe. To do this dangerous task will mean giving up his family and possibly his life—Shevek must make the unprecedented journey to the utopian mother planet, Urras, to challenge the complex structures of life and living, and ignite the fires of change.;"First of all: if you haven't already read The Dispossessed, then do so. Somehow, probably because it comes with an SF sticker, it isn't yet officially labeled as one of the great novels of the 20th century. They're going to fix that eventually, so why not get in ahead of the crowd? It's not just a terrific story; it might change your life. Ursula Le Guin is saying some pretty important stuff here.So, what is it she's saying that's so important? I've read the book several times since I first came across it as a teenager, and my perception of it has changed over time. There's more than one layer, and I, at least, didn't immediately realize that. On the surface, the first thing you notice is the setting. She is presenting a genuinely credible anarchist utopia. Most utopias are irritating or just plain silly. You read them, and at best you shake your head and wish that people actually were like that; or, more likely, you wonder how the author can be quite so deluded. This one's different. Le Guin has thought about it a lot, and taken into account the obvious fact that people are often selfish and stupid. You feel that her anarchist society actually could work; it doesn't work all the time, and there are things about it that you see are going to cause problems. But, like the US Constitution (one of my favorite utopian documents) it seems to have the necessary flexibility and groundedness that allow it to adapt to changing circumstances and survive. She's done a good job, and you can't help admiring the brave and kind Annaresti.Another thing you're immediately impressed by is the central character, Shevek. Looking at the other reviews, everyone loves Shevek. I love him too. He's one of the most convincing fictional scientists I know; I'm a scientist myself, so I'm very sensitive to the nuances. Like his society, he's not in any way perfect, and his life is a long struggle to try and understand the secrets of temporal physics, which he often feels are completely beyond him. I was impressed by the alien science; she gives you just the right amount of background that it feels credible, but not so much that you're tempted to nit-pick the details. You're swept up in his quest to unify Sequency and Simultaneity, without ever needing to know exactly what they are. And his relationship with Takver is a great love story, with some wonderfully moving scenes. There's one line in particular which, despite being utterly simple and understated, never fails to bring tears to my eyes. As you also see in The Lathe of Heaven, Le Guin knows about love.What I've said so far would already be enough to qualify this as a good book that was absolutely worth reading. What I think makes it a great book is her analysis of the concept of freedom. There are so many other interesting things to look at that at first you don't quite notice it, but to me it's the core of the novel. What does it mean to be truly free? At first, you think that the Annaresti have already achieved that; it's just a question of having the right social structures. But after a while you see that it's not nearly as straightforward as you first imagined. Real freedom means that you have to be able to challenge the beliefs of the people around you when they conflict with what you, yourself, truly believe, and that can be painful for everyone. But it's essential, and it's particularly essential if you want to be a scientist; I know this from personal experience. Another theme that suffuses the book is the concept of the Promise. If you can't make and keep promises, then you have no influence on the future; you are locked in the present. But promising something also binds your future self. There are some deep paradoxes here. The book folds the arguments unobtrusively into the narrative, and never shoves them in your face, but after a while you see that they are what tie all the strands together: the anarchist society, the science, the love story, the politics. It's a much deeper book than you first realize. As I said, it might change your life. It's changed mine.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13651.The_Dispossessed
Ringworld;Larry Niven;1970;1970;288;3.94;123438;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy'];The artefact is a circular ribbon of matter six hundred million miles long and ninety million miles in radius. Pierson's puppeteers, the aliens who discovered it, are understandably wary of encountering the builders of such an immense structure and have assembled a team of two humans, a mad puppeteer and a kzin, a huge cat-like alien, to explore it. But a crash landing on the vast edifice forces the crew on a desperate and dangerous trek across the Ringworld.;A very interesting concept....BUT, I have to get on my soapbox for a minute. After reading a few of his books, I have to say that Larry Niven's attitude towards women, what they are like and what they are capable of, is sadly lacking. Though his male characters seem to be pretty well fleshed out (human--even if they are alien--fallible and interesting), his female characters are sadly one-dimensional. It seems to me that most the female character in his books are either clueless, idiot savants, helpless before the sexual attraction of the main character(s), or all the above. Ok, I'm off my soapbox now.Though this little issue nearly spoils it for me, the convoluted plot is well thought-out and the concept of the novel is interesting...blah blah blah...I will say that it's still worth reading. With a grain of salt. In response to all those that say that Niven should be excused for essentially being an old man... and for being born in the first half of the last century...I'd like to point out the following: A) This book was written in 1970, well after the feminist movement had taken root. B) There is a vast array of male sci-fi authors, both contemporary with Mr. Niven and writing earlier, that don't have this same issue. **cough cough Tolkien cough Douglas Adams cough Frank Herbert cough**. Excuse me. :)C) This is my opinion and a warning to other feminist-types (lukewarm or otherwise), not an attack on Mr. Niven's character nor overall ability as an author. Kind of. D) That being said, it's frustrating that an important character in this interesting novel would be so incredibly (and irritatingly) one-dimensional. Just saying.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61179.Ringworld
A Scanner Darkly;Philip K. Dick;1977;1970;219;4.02;103985;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Cyberpunk'];Substance D is not known as Death for nothing. It is the most toxic drug ever to find its way on to the streets of LA. It destroys the links between the brain's two hemispheres, causing, first, disorientation and then complete and irreversible brain damage.The undercover narcotics agent who calls himself Bob Arctor is desperate to discover the ultimate source of supply. But to find any kind of lead he has to pose as a user and, inevitably, without realising what is happening, Arctor is soon as addicted as the junkies he works among...;"A Scanner Darkly can be described as follows: begin with Hunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, mix in a pinch of The Big Lebowski, a dollop of A Beautiful Mind, a scene from Crime and Punishment, the shadows and penumbra of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, whispered apprehension of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a hint of thirty year in advance anticipation of reality TV, stir in a portion of dystopian science fiction and mix it all together with Philip K. Dick’s weird genius. This is actually a very well written book; PKD delivers a mature, far from romantic glimpse of addiction and the drug sub-culture as only he could, a recovering, on again off again user himself and with mental illness added in. Still, this is a complete work by a talented writer and, minimalistic as it is, keeps the reader engaged. There is humor in the book, though it cannot be considered a comedy, perhaps a dark comedy as the subject matter, though painted with a mild sci-fi brush, is one of addiction and death. A reader of PKD’s works will notice the recurring theme here, as in several other works, of the idea of split personalities, of a protagonist coming to grips with multiple sides of his own ego. Another recurring theme, perhaps helped along by PKD’s own struggles with schizophrenia, is one of surveillance and, concurrently, helplessness while being watched. The pervasive paranoia and the multiple layers of theatrical irony are the elements of this story that will stay with the reader long after the book has been set down.*** 2023 reread - I’ve often wondered about the artistic synchronicity going on in the late 70s and early 80s that produced such unrelated but similar works like Bladerunner, Neuromancer and Rush’s 1982 single Digital Man. Something in the water.The connection between PKD and Gibson’s Neuromancer may ride through this twisted nightmare from 1977. Conceived and drafted in the early 7os but rewritten for years before its eventual publication. Instantly lauded as something special this has come to be one of Phil’s most recognizable and referenced works and its spiritual undertones make it representative of his later work. I can see the foreshadowed confidence of Molly Millions in one of Dick’s characters here.And is it just me or are there shades of Orwell’s 1984 in the protagonist’s denouement? Or was it Burgess’ A Clockwork Orange? What in the hell did Phil mean by this? Are the members of society kneeling and extending tongues out as far as possible to catch the drops of acid doled out by government flunkies in a capitalistic dystopian landscape? Is addiction written in our code? Gibson, are you paying attention? All the more reason to respect Phil’s work here.A PKD fan will notice that if this is compared to some of his early 60s work, likely much of it rushed to the printers first drafts, the legend that this was rewritten over and over for years, makes us wonder about how good Phil could have been. But the buzzsaw frenzy of his prolificacy is a big part of the charisma of his canon and maybe take away the paying the rent immediacy of his most colorful SF might have been throwing the baby out with the bathwater.I’ve always thought this was one of his best books but now I think this is may be his best. Yes, Ubik and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Man in the High Castle get most of the awards and praise, but I submit to you, the Court of Goodreads, that this work, labored over for years as it described an autobiographical element of Phil’s own street drug experience, best portrays the damaged but creative genius of Philip K. Dick.At any rate, this reread of this spot on book about addiction, with Phil’s inimitable mirrored elevator of paranoia and surveillance, was a joy to revisit, even considering its darkness and sober subject matter, and I should make this a more frequent reread.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14817.A_Scanner_Darkly
The Lathe of Heaven;Ursula K. Le Guin;1971;1970;176;4.12;77047;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction'];A classic science fiction novel by one of the greatest writers of the genre, set in a future world where one man's dreams control the fate of humanity. In a future world racked by violence and environmental catastrophes, George Orr wakes up one day to discover that his dreams have the ability to alter reality. He seeks help from Dr. William Haber, a psychiatrist who immediately grasps the power George wields. Soon George must preserve reality itself as Dr. Haber becomes adept at manipulating George's dreams for his own purposes. The Lathe of Heaven is an eerily prescient novel from award-winning author Ursula K. Le Guin that masterfully addresses the dangers of power and humanity's self-destructiveness, questioning the nature of reality itself. It is a classic of the science fiction genre.;"Warning: contains major spoiler for A Wizard of EarthseaWhen I first came across this book as a teenager, I think I only really noticed the surface story. George Orr is a man whose dreams, literally, come true; he dreams something, and when he wakes up the world has changed. There's an unscrupulous psychiatrist who wants to exploit George's gift, a love story, some interesting aliens, and a good ending. I really liked it. I've read it three or four times since then, and each time I've appreciated it more. One could imagine a book with a similar plot being written by Philip K. Dick, but, if Dick had done it, it would have had a different focus. Le Guin is also interested in the arbitrary nature of reality, but she is above all a moral writer, and it's easiest to explain why I think The Lathe of Heaven is a great novel if I compare it with some of her other books. Perhaps my favorite moment in her work is the ending of A Wizard of Earthsea. Ged has been relentlessly pursued for years by the deadly Shadow, whose one purpose seems to be to destroy him and everything he cares for. If only he could learn its true name, he would be able to use his magic powers to overcome it. Finally, when he can run no further and is forced to confront it on the open sea, he realizes what he has knows all along. The Shadow's true name is his own name. He, himself, is the dark force that is trying to ruin his life. The struggle with the dark forces inside oneself is one of Le Guin's main preoccupations. This shades over into her fascination with creativity and the creative process, and in particular with the scientist, whose dreams can create reality in the most unexpected manner. Einstein turned a dream of matter, energy, space and time into a reality which soon crystalized as nuclear weapons. (My Japanese friend Yukie, who studied in Hiroshima, met several people who had come directly into contact with Einstein's escaped dream). In The Dispossessed, Shevek is a scientist who manages to control his dream. Le Guin, who clearly understands scientists well, shows just how difficult this is for him. He has to fight his society, and many of the ideas he has been brought up to believe in. As in A Wizard of Earthsea, a lot of the time he also has to fight himself.The Lathe of Heaven, published three years before The Dispossessed, is a kind of rehearsal for the later novel, but with a myth-like treatment more reminiscent of A Wizard of Earthsea. George Orr's supernatural gift hands him a huge responsibility, which he is slow to accept. Like most dreamers, he lets himself be manipulated. And, just as in The Dispossessed, love is the key. There, Takver's unquestioning love for Shevek is what makes it possible for him to unlock the Principle of Simultaneity; here, the simple and touching romance with Heather is what gives George the strength to make the right decision when he reaches the crucial moment. Dreams, truth, responsibility, love. If you're interested in that kind of thing, you should consider reading The Lathe of Heaven. Like all her books, it's beautifully written.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59924.The_Lathe_of_Heaven
Roadside Picnic;Arkady Strugatsky;1972;1970;145;4.14;71973;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Russia', 'Classics', 'Russian Literature', 'Fantasy', 'Novels'];Red Schuhart is a stalker, one of those young rebels who are compelled, in spite of extreme danger, to venture illegally into the Zone to collect the mysterious artifacts that the alien visitors left scattered around. His life is dominated by the place and the thriving black market in the alien products. But when he and his friend Kirill go into the Zone together to pick up a “full empty,” something goes wrong. And the news he gets from his girlfriend upon his return makes it inevitable that he’ll keep going back to the Zone, again and again, until he finds the answer to all his problems.First published in 1972, Roadside Picnic is still widely regarded as one of the greatest science fiction novels, despite the fact that it has been out of print in the United States for almost thirty years.;"2021: I read it a few years ago, and reread it now with a bit of trepidation (which luckily proved baseless), and it’s still full of that strange, disorienting, confusing and yet utterly human magic. I read it in the original and in translation (this time side-by-side) and it’s interesting how the magic subtly shifts in a different language, how different angles become more prominent, how the personalities are softly affected by different words and phrases. But the soul is the same, that same soul that erupts in that tortured scream in the end.A story of a horrific yet fascinating place, a story of an ordinary and unlikable man just trying to get by, a philosophical interlude on humanity and its significance or lack thereof, of greed and wonder, and the fever dream of the soul scream. It still speaks to me.“HAPPINESS, FREE, FOR EVERYONE, AND LET NO ONE BE FORGOTTEN!”—————2013: When people talk about the ""special"" feel of Russian literature, I tend to shrug it away as yet another point of confusion ""Westerners"" have with anything Slavic. But when I tried to explain the feeling this book evoked in me to a few ""Westerners"" I startlingly realized that ""it just *feels* so essentially Russian""may indeed be a valid description that encompasses the soul-searching ambiguity, the pursuit of deeper truths shrouded in light sadness, the frustrating but yet revealing lack of answers to the clear divide between right and wrong, and the heart shattering ""scream of soul"".

This is a story of the aftermath of the aliens' visit to our planet. Well, a visit may be too grand of a word. It seems dishearteningly likely that the space visitors made little notice of us; that their visit here was little but a ""roadside picnic"" - a quick stop in the middle of nowhere, a break after which they left to never be seen again, leaving only a bit of waste behind them - the relics worth quite a bit of money, and a toxic area - the Zone¹ - where humans cannot survive, where the invisible effects of something inside it inflict permanent scars (mental and physical) on those brave (or foolish) enough to venture inside it.¹It was hard for me to believe that this book was written years before the catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station - an explosion that left a ""Zone"" full of deadly invisible poison affecting those in it or near it, with ghost city that once was full of people and now is just a shell of a disaster.No wonder that in popular culture Chernobyl and Strugatsky's ""stalker"" became intertwined.
The disheartening insignificance of the contact goes well against the well-established rules of science fiction. There was no communication, no contact, nothing. It appears that despite the hopes of all the science fiction writers over decades, we were not that interesting to the other intelligence - actually, we probably weren't even worth noticing. Just a matter-of-fact quick purposeless roadstop and a bunch of refuse - which still proceeds to affect the lives of people around the mysterious Zones. 
 “A picnic. Imagine: a forest, a country road, a meadow. A car pulls off the road into the meadow and unloads young men, bottles, picnic baskets, girls, transistor radios, cameras … A fire is lit, tents are pitched, music is played. And in the morning they leave. The animals, birds, and insects that were watching the whole night in horror crawl out of their shelters. And what do they see? An oil spill, a gasoline puddle, old spark plugs and oil filters strewn about… Scattered rags, burntout bulbs, someone has dropped a monkey wrench. The wheels have tracked mud from some godforsaken swamp… and, of course, there are the remains of the campfire, apple cores, candy wrappers, tins, bottles, someone’s handkerchief, someone’s penknife, old ragged newspapers, coins, wilted flowers from another meadow…”
Echoing the insignificance of humanity is the apparent insignificance of the main character. Red Schuhart is a ""stalker"" - a ""riffraff"" taking frequent quick forays into the Zone to smuggle out the alien artifacts that are valued on the black market, undeterred by having to live on the outside of the law, always at risk of horrific side effects or death inside and imprisonment outside. He does what he does not for any noble purpose but simply because there's little else to do. He is a common guy, ordinary, inconsequential, average, hard-hit by life. His goals are not noble - just survival. He’s vulgar, a drunkard, a cynic. In life, he is a bottomfeeder. It's underscored many times how inconsequential Red is - and maybe it's precisely why his plight has such an appeal to us. After all, despite the bravado, most of us carry no illusions of our own significance in the grand scheme of things.The visits to the Zone that we undertake with Red and his less cynical, more wide-eyed companions - first ill-fated Kirill, then just as ill-fated Arthur - are harrowing in a peculiarly surreal fashion. It's not about what's happening - it's about the possibility of something unknown yet dreadful happening, the nerves set completely on the edge, the uneasiness of tense anticipation. You can feel the characters on the verge of snapping, and the uneasy feeling is omnipresent.And yes, in the true Russian and Soviet fashion, the politics are very much in the background of this story even if it's written as though it's seemingly apolitical¹.The idea of little people affected by the ""bigger things"" that are out of their reach. The caution of us unable to understand and come to grasp with even the refuse of the outside civilization. The endless corruption that always seen to almost spontaneously spring into being. The mundane drone hopelessness of being just cogs in the machine. The hollowness of the society. The bitterness of a small person when faced with something larger - be it other worlds, or the government, or the powers that we do not understand, or humanity itself.¹ The story is apolitical but not free from pursuing the human truths and showing the good and bad of humanity. It’s just that Strugatskys see human nature without resorting to overt and obligatory politicizing that’s often so tempting.As great Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in the foreword to the excellently translated edition: “The Strugatsky brothers were not blatant, and never (to my limited knowledge) directly critical of their government’s policies. What they did, which I found most admirable then and still do now, was to write as if they were indifferent to ideology—something many of us writers in the Western democracies had a hard time doing. They wrote as free men write.”
And yet there is something akin to hope in the end - or, on the other thought, maybe there is not. Redrick's semi-delusional soliloquy at the end of the book, in the sight of the mysterious Golden Sphere - the feverish, desperate, pleading semi-rational painful revelation as he with horror realizes that ""My whole life I haven't had a single thought!"", that ""... they've cheated me, left me voiceless..."" in the semi-delirious haze — is his final scream-of-soul speech a fierce ray of hope for us or is it another lost, desperate, delusional scream into the void? Maybe there's no answer, after all.
And he was no longer trying to think. He just kept repeating to himself in despair, like a prayer, ""I'm an animal, you can see that I'm an animal. I have no words, they haven't taught me the words; I don't know how to think, those bastards didn't let me learn how to think. But if you really are — all powerful, all knowing, all understanding — figure it out! Look into my soul, I know — everything you need is in there. It has to be. Because I've never sold my soul to anyone! It's mine, it's human! Figure out yourself what I want — because I know it can't be bad! The hell with it all, I just can't think of a thing other than those words of his — HAPPINESS, FREE, FOR EVERYONE, AND LET NO ONE BE FORGOTTEN!""
————————Brief thoughts on the movie “Stalker” by Tarkovsky, a very loose adaptation of this novel:So I just watched Tarkovsky’s “Stalker” — the cult film loosely based on Strugatskys novel. Finally. And I have a bit of conflicted feelings about it. It’s an interesting film, quite similar in tone to “Solaris” (which I liked). But just the barest bones of connection to “Roadside Picnic” kept me at bay, making me realize how much I prefer the novel to the film. I think I would have liked it more had these been unrelated — and honestly, take out “stalker” and “zone” and the wish-granting artifact — and they may as well be separate works of art. So that’s really the only way I can think of them - almost separate works, of the “loosely inspired-by” variety.“Stalker” is visually stunning, and the melancholy of its tone somehow eventually bordering on religious fervor is captivating. But — well, I cared more about the book, about Red and his painful journey, about life and choices and humanity, while the film left me fascinated but overall a bit cold. Both are good, but if you have to choose one, choose the book.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331256.Roadside_Picnic
The Mote in God's Eye;Larry Niven;1974;1970;596;4.07;70724;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Aliens'];In 3016, the 2nd Empire of Man spans hundreds of star systems, thanks to faster-than-light Alderson Drive. Intelligent beings are finally found from the Mote, an isolated star in a thick dust cloud. The bottled-up ancient civilization, at least one million years old, are welcoming, kind, yet evasive, with a dark problem they have not solved in over a million years.;Very entertaining, interesting, intriguing, thought provoking, etc. Good science fiction. Robert A. Heinlein himself is quoted as saying something to the effect that this was the best science fiction novel he had ever read. I don’t know that I’d go that far, but this was very good. David Allen Coe claimed to have sang the perfect country and western song, and in that same regard, Niven and Pournellle may have collaborated to create the perfect science fiction novel, it contains all of the important elements: future, space travel, time travel, aliens, space ships, laser blasters, planetary colonies, etc. etc. Whoever created the 1980s film Gremlins may have read The Mote in God’s Eye and been inspired by the miniature Moties, or watchmakers. Called a masterpiece by many, and it may well be, but it is not without its flaws. There are inconsistencies, the language of the New Scotts and New Ruskies is superficial and distracting, and it is too long, some good editing may have shaved a hundred pages and strengthened the narrative.Still it is very good. The creation of the Motie alien race was masterful, full of brilliant and thoughtful attention to detail. Though the characterization is not an especially strong point, many characters are painfully one dimensional and static, the authors created a Nietzschean juggernaut in Admiral Kutusov, and he steals the show. ** 2017 reread - as good now as ever, a little dated, sexist yes, oddly aristocratic, but fun.

The Gods Themselves;Isaac Asimov;1972;1970;288;4.09;64610;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Hugo Awards', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];In the twenty-second century Earth obtains limitless, free energy from a source science little understands: an exchange between Earth and a parallel universe, using a process devised by the aliens. But even free energy has a price. The transference process itself will eventually lead to the destruction of the Earth's Sun--and of Earth itself.Only a few know the terrifying truth--an outcast Earth scientist, a rebellious alien inhabitant of a dying planet, a lunar-born human intuitionist who senses the imminent annihilation of the Sun.  They know the truth--but who will listen?  They have foreseen the cost of abundant energy--but who will believe?  These few beings, human and alien, hold the key to the Earth's survival.;"Isaac Asimov rarely wrote about either aliens or sex. In response to critics who complained about these omissions, he wrote a book about alien sex. Rather, a book whose middle third is mostly about alien sex. (Mostly.) The other two thirds of the book tell one of the ""purest"" and ""hardest"" science fiction stories I've ever read.By pure, I mean that there's a single, science-related ""what-if,"" and that the story hinges upon that. (In contrast to, for example, a space opera such as Star Trek, in which there are many imaginary technologies, most of which serve as background, rather than as the impetus of the story. Not that there's anything at all wrong with a good space opera.) The motivator for The Gods Themselves is the question, ""what if there were a parallel universe in which the laws of physics were a little different?""By hard, I mean that the science is accurate. Which is not to suggest that this reads like a textbook at all; only that the fiction is grounded in reality, as it should be.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41821.The_Gods_Themselves
The Great Dune Trilogy;Frank Herbert;1979;1970;912;4.37;61906;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Novels'];Herbert's evocative, epic tales are set on the desert planet Arrakis, the focus for a complex political and military struggle with galaxy-wide repercussions. This volume includes the titles Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune.;Frank Herbert's Dune was in part inspired by his experience working in a research centre in California studying desertification. The realisation of the interrelationship of environment, people and culture coming out of that experience is a key feature of the series. At the centre of the first novel is a desert planet, Arrakis, and the secret desire of its inhabitants to transform it's ecology. It is a great science-fiction novel about systems of power and the role of ecology, although admittedly delivered in an accept it or loath it writing style and with various weird ideas including: Feudalism in space, a stress on lineages in which nonetheless many of the women seem to be mystic-concubines, homosexuality is shorthand for depraved evil, and space Arabs with blue eyes.The sequels are not fascinating unlike the first novel. Full of enthusiasm after reading Dune I read Dune Messiah but it is one of those books that divides the fans from the readers I suppose. In Children of Dune we see the surface of Arrakis beginning to change as the plans to transform the ecology of the plant are being put into effect, and some of the social implications of those changes beginning to emerge, but the book is not as packed with ideas as Dune. For something similarly ambitious yet more consistent in its delivery (& I lost interest in this series as it ran on and on) I personally prefer Brian Aldiss' Helliconia Trilogy.The weigh of the ideas is really all placed in the first volume. The Feudal-Federalism of the Space-Empire, the breeding programme to create a Messiah figure who can guide humanity towards an unpredictable future, the land makes the people and the people make the land, the replacement of computers with specialised people. The subsequent books are really just the working through of the ideas set out there. It is all inevitable and the reading as a result is poorer. Dune perhaps epitomises science-fiction. The willingness to embrace big ideas and show them playing out on a broad canvas married to uneven writing and a a certain 'what-the Hell-ness' as the author lays out their pet sociological/anthropological opinions. The David Lynch film, I feel, captures the oddness of the reading experience quite well and perhaps sets about chopping at the text with a brutality which oddly appropriate. Alternatively it offers a combination of the latter books of the Old Testament with a sensitivity towards the influence of the environment upon man and of man upon the environment. At points this works on its own terms, at others it rather strangles itself with its own pretensions. You have to read it to believe it.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53764.The_Great_Dune_Trilogy
Gateway;Frederik Pohl;1977;1970;278;4.06;45469;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Hugo Awards', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics'];Gateway opened on all the wealth of the Universe... and on reaches of unimaginable horror. When prospector Robinette Broadhead went out to Gateway on the Heechee spacecraft, he decided he would know which was the right mission to make him his fortune. Three missions later, now famous and permanently rich, Rob Broadhead has to face what happened to him and what he has become... in a journey into himself as perilous and even more horrifying than the nightmare trip through the interstellar void that he drove himself to take!;Kind of the same as Pohls´ cooperation with Kornbluth, The Space Merchants, with an extra layer of psychiatric mind penetrationNo free meals in neoliberal, turbo capitalistic alien artifact filled alien spaceports The whole system, the immense suffering on earth with the option of risking one´s life to get some grains of the immense wealth accumulated with patents found on suicide trips, exploiting anyone for the profit of some, was, is, and will be the key element of capitalistic systems Pohl wasn´t quite fond of. Sarcasm drips from each black humoured page and one could imagine that this is a possible future in corporate owned space habitats, planets, and solar systems. Is it deep or just playing with childhood trauma, relationship issues, and making fun of psychiatry. See, the main protagonist has some serious issues and searches for help in episodes I, highly subjectively, would have preferred to instead see as more exploration, meeting the aliens, or something else not that separated from the main plot. However, there is the one or other good toilet humor pun, but besides that, I don´t get how these stereotypical parent and partner problem drivel does anything substantial for the plot and its message of promoting leftist socialist propaganda, socializing the suffering, and stuff. Or I just don´t get that it´s a satire of psychology and psychiatry as a hidden bonus storyline.Still, it should subjectively have been avoided because genre audiences don´t like thatWithout that, the work would be an instant masterpiece, but by slowing the plot, losing suspense, and not really giving a satisfying conclusion, all linked to the problem of this unnecessary extra plotline, Pohl missed his place in the grand hall of sci-fi behemoth he could easily have entered after The Space Merchants by simply cooking with the same recipes. But I don´t want new herbs and hot cuisine experiments, I´m a genre savvy, kind of intolerant and conservative dude regarding my sci-fi and there is no place for empty relationship drivel.Uchronia onLet´s just do as if it never happened and that Pohl wouldn´t have polluted his work with the banality of human emotional deficits, and focus on how brilliantly the companies squeeze the last buck out of all of their astronauts, how the whole system is optimized towards forcing the people to risk their lives, how the many small anecdotes, elements, puns, and innuendos make it a work that inspired future, critical minds like Richard Morgan and very probably many others.

Lucifer's Hammer;Larry Niven;1977;1970;629;4.0;44200;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Apocalyptic', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia'];"THE LUCKY ONES WENT FIRST…The gigantic comet has slammed into Earth, forging earthquakes a thousand times too powerful to measure on the Richter scale, tidal waves thousands of feet high. Cities were turned into oceans; oceans turned into steam. It was the beginning of a new Ice Age and the end of civilizationBut for the terrified men and women chance had saved, it was also the dawn of a new struggle for survival—a struggle more dangerous and challenging than any they had ever known….";"The Hammer disregards all pleas not to 'hurt 'em.'_____There should be a name for the particular type of book that is exemplified by some popular novels published between the late 1950s and the early 1980s. It's very distinctive, but hard to describe. Some characteristics include: an insistence on referring to men by their last names only, flat characterization which tends to adhere to sterotypical gender roles, a focus on jobs/career as being a key part of identity, and a predominance of loveless relationships and adulterous affairs. It's more than just that, though - I really have never managed to quite put my finger on it. But it doesn't take long to recognize. After a few pages, I was like, ""Oh, it's one of those."" (I also thought, throughout reading it, that it was published in 1970, not 1977 - maybe I saw a bit of misinformation, but it feels VERY dated and regressive.)Still, this started out in the three-star range, and stayed there for about the first 40% of the book. For that section, I was strongly reminded of Neal Stephenson's 'Seveneves,' to the point where I suspected (and still suspect) that Stephenson read this book - and wanted to do it better. (Stephenson succeeded, if that was the goal.) Of course, the difference is that in Seveneves, we're getting hit by moon bits and in Lucifer's Hammer, by comet bits, but the setup is very similar: We see the discovery of the phenomenon, the media reaction, and start glimpsing the effects on the daily lives of a wide range of people, including politicians, experts, and average joes. There's also the crew up in Skylab. There's a huge cast of characters, which meant for me, in this book, that I didn't feel emotionally invested in any of them, and for a while, the book dragged a bit. (The way the many characters were handled reminded me a bit of Kim Stanley Robinson's 'Mars' books - but those are better-written (sensing a trend here?))When the comet hits and disaster strikes, things picked up a bit. (How could that not be exciting?) Unlike 'Seveneves', we get a more typical 'aftermath.' The book focuses on rural California, and a group of ranchers that pull together for survival, initially joined by their dedicated mailman, who insists on continuing his route. (Did this influence David Brin's 'The Postman'? If so, again, Brin did it better.) As the small details of survival go on, the book becomes very similar to Pat Frank's 1959 'Alas Babylon,' in the way it focuses on a small group in an isolated rural location, and the ins-and-outs of how they keep alive. It got a bit tedious - and quite sexist (repeated mentions of man's 'natural instinct' to 'protect the female' coming out, and how 'women's lib' is now defunct), with a few dashes of racism. I'm also a lot more inclined to be forgiving of certain attitudes in a 1959 book than in a 1977 book. Throughout this part of the book, my opinion dropped down to two stars.Around 80%, Niven and Pournelle pull out all the stops. It's like they figured, ""If they've read this far, they're not going to stop now, so we can go all out and pull no punches with what we really think."" This final part of the book is almost like a satire of right-wing attitudes - except that it's painfully clear that it's in earnest. I guess that it's a fascinating glimpse into everything that those of a certain mindset really fear? (Talking about the end here, so - hiding... but really, I'd recommend reading this spoiler instead of the book): The finale is a drawn-out, multi-part big Showdown Battle - the opposing sides are: on one side, of course, our brave American ranchers. The ranchers are White and Conservative, although joined by one Exceptional Black Man who literally says, at one point, disparaging equal-rights activists ""I have all the equality I've ever wanted."" There are also the two Russians who exist to mention how superior the US is to Russia in oh so many ways, and the reformed hippies who have realized that communes are a bad idea. Oh, at the very end, out of the blue appear some previously-unmentioned Noble Indian warriors. Oh, and don't forget that a point is made that ""men and women are still different"" and due to tough times, kids have to grow up fast - which means that boys fight & teen girls are now fair game for middle-aged men. Politicians and military men (who are all physically large; that point is made repeatedly) feature prominently.Opposing our Brave Heroes is a diverse rampaging army made up of (I kid you not): Trade Unionists (damn commies!), Environmentalists, Black Panthers, Back to Nature types (including Hippies and proponents of organic farming), and assorted City Folk, who are led by a raving preacher who forces them into bloody cannibalistic rituals. (!!!) I mean, it seems like it HAS to be a joke...? But then it's just not very funny...To top it all off, there's a Great Battle to Save the Nuclear Plant from the Mixed-Race Horde. Bear in mind, the reason to save the power plant is not because destroying the plant could result in a nuclear meltdown which would render the entire area uninhabitable. Noooo... this is a VERY SAFE nuclear plant, and that could never happen due to all the Safety Features. No, it becomes a symbol of the Light and Hope of All Future Technology-Based Civilization, which is driven home in a luridly purple death scene, in case the readers missed it. So, woo-hoo! The battle is won. It is pointed out repeatedly that one should not regard ones' enemies as human; they're just ants. Technology will be rebuilt, but until it is, it's gonna be ""A Man's World."" People will work hard in a manly way, accompanied by their strong yet womanly women. They will be cooperative, but not in a communist way. Justice will be harsh. And as the cherry on top of this fantasy, slavery is reinstated. (Yes, really!) Woo-hoo! And... down to one star.Read for post-apocalyptic book club. I guess I'm glad I read it, just because I've seen it around nearly my whole life - even physically picked it up in the library on a couple of occasions - but never read it until now. But, hoo-boy, this was quite something. And not a good something.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218467.Lucifer_s_Hammer
The Stepford Wives;Ira Levin;1972;1970;144;3.85;43810;no;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Feminism'];For Joanna, her husband, Walter, and their children, the move to beautiful Stepford seems almost too good to be true. It is. For behind the town's idyllic facade lies a terrible secret—a secret so shattering that no one who encounters it will ever be the same.At once a masterpiece of psychological suspense and a savage commentary on a media-driven society that values the pursuit of youth and beauty at all costs, The Stepford Wives is a novel so frightening in its final implications that the title itself has earned a place in the American lexicon.;"Disparate Housewives.  In the midst of the women’s liberation movement, a little town in Connecticut seems to show an inexplicable regression. Independent women are turning into cleaning maniacs and dedicated housewives. What the hell is happening? Something in the air? The water? Is it a disease? Is it contagious? Walter, Joanna Eberhart and their kids are new in Stepford, but when she realizes something fishy going on, it all becomes a desperate quest for answers, before it’s too late.For some reason this is marketed as a horror novel, but I found it to be much closer to a psychological thriller, and a very good one. Fast paced, and packing quite a punch. Very short, but extremely gripping. Everything moving so fast it’s over before you even know it. A somewhat too open ending for my taste, but a welcomed one overall. Joanna plays a wonderful heroine, and Bobbie a lovely and hilarious sidekick. Quite a bunch of feminist references too, which will be duly investigated at the appropriate time. Recommendable.*** The movie (1975) is a great adaptation. Katharine Ross plays a convincing Joanna, but Paula Prentiss perfectly nails Bobbie and is the absolute best of the movie by far; so crazy, and utterly adorable. Not nearly as good as the book, but very faithful, several direct quotes can be found all through the film. An ending that goes a bit beyond the original work, and possibly gives a more satisfying answer to the mystery.*** The remake (2004) is a terrible adaptation, and is critically panned for good reasons. Beside the protagonists and some general idea of the plot, everything else has been changed, and not really in a good way. No direct quotes, and lot of things added that doesn't make justice to Levin’s work. Not even a cast including stars like Kidman, Broderick, Midler, Close and Walken can save it. Points for some very funny moments, but very unfaithful to the book, and quite cheesy sometimes.-----------------------------------------------

Walter, Joanna Eberhart y sus hijos son nuevos en Stepford, pero cuando se da cuenta de que algo raro está sucediendo, todo se vuelve en una desesperada búsqueda por la verdad, antes de que sea demasiado tarde.Por alguna razón esto está identificado como una novela de terror, pero yo lo encontré mucho más cercano a un thriller psicológico, y uno muy bueno. De ritmo muy rápido, y con un golpe directo y certero. Muy corto, pero extremadamente atrapante. Todo transcurre tan rápido que termina antes de que te des cuenta. Un final algo demasiado abierto para mi gusto, pero dentro de todo bienvenido. Joanna hace una estupenda heroína, y Bobbie una adorable e hilarante compañera. Un montón de referencias feministas también, que serán debidamente investigadas a su tiempo. Recomendable.*** La película (1975) es una excelente adaptación. Katharine Ross hace una convincente Joanna, pero Paula Prentiss acierta perfectamente a Bobbie y es absolutamente lo mejor de toda la película; tan alocada, y terriblemente adorable. No tan buena como el libro, pero muy fiel, varias citas directas pueden ser encontradas a lo largo del film. Y un final que va un poco más allá de la obra original, y posiblemente brinda una respuesta más satisfactoria al misterio.*** El remake (2004) es una terrible adaptación, y duramente criticada por buenas razones. Más allá de las protagonistas y una idea general de la trama, todo lo demás fue cambiado, y no realmente de una buena forma. No hay citas directas, y muchas cosas fueron agregadas que no le hacen justicia a la obra de Levin. Ni siquiera un elenco incluyendo estrellas como Kidman, Broderick, Midler, Close y Walken lo puede salvar.

Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said;Philip K. Dick;1974;1970;204;3.91;42177;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Novels', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'American'];Jason Taverner woke up one morning to find himself completely unknown. The night before he had been the top-rated television star with millions of devoted watchers. The next day he was just an unidentified walking object, whose face nobody recognised, of whom no one had heard, and without the I.D. papers required in that near future.When he finally found a man who would agree to counterfeiting such cards for him, that man turned out to be a police informer. And then Taverner found out not only what it was like to be a nobody but also to be hunted by the whole apparatus of society.It was obvious that in some way Taverner had become the pea in in some sort of cosmic shell game - but how? And why?Philip K. Dick takes the reader on a walking tour of solipsism's scariest margin in his latest novel about the age we are already half into.;Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said is one of Philip K. Dick’s best. Yet unlike many main characters from PKD’s books, protagonist Jason Taverner is not a misunderstood, delusional recluse, but rather a world famous, genetically superior celebrity. Supporting protagonist Felix Buckman is a police general with only a handful of individuals more powerful. PKD uses these worldly heroes to illustrate the transience and frailty of what people understand as important. Taverner spends a couple of days where no one knows or even recognizes him. Buckman is made to encounter a reality where he is far from in control, and where the whole basis of his power, of the world’s power structure is shown to be ephemeral and false.Set in a dystopian future where the United States is ruled by a police state after a second civil war, and where students are hunted down and interred in forced labor camps, Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said brings together many mainstay themes of PKD’s work. This one is more over the top than most, and this is where Dick is at his best.*** 2023 reread - If I ever get the time I could draw a spectrum for PKD writing. On one end would be realism, populated mainly by his later books and his mainstream work. On the other end would be the absurdist stories that are more caricature than real, those works that revel in weirdness and that demonstrate his great imagination but told with a wink and a nod.Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said would be a little left of center, over on the absurdist side of the continuum. Or! Like Shakespeare’s works, this might be akin to a comedy whereas Dick’s A Scanner Darkly would be like a Shakespearean tragedy.Having read this before, I was able to hone in on many references that I may not have understood last time and I felt like I better enjoyed the comedic quality of Dick’s writing this time. Several laugh out loud scenes and even more language that made me smile.First published in 1974, this is a transitional work between his wild amphetamine fueled production of the sixties and his later theological works. This is also the most sexual of his works. Bad relationships are a staple of PKD stories but here he is almost Silverbergian in his soft porn depictions. Almost. Robert A. Heinlein and Robert Silverberg, the Bob and Bob of seventies SF licentiousness, have nothing to worry about from normally staid Phil. The SF police state story with questioned reality is good (and the reality bending elements of this one were similar to a scene in Dick’s 1962 Man in the High Castle), but what really makes this so good are the asides and soliloquies delivered by our players amidst all of the PKD chaos. It is here, in Hunter S. Thompson like moments of lucidity, that Phillip K. Dick demonstrates his great genius.Finally, if I could direct an adaption of this novel to film, I would have it animated and produced in a similar fashion to Archer.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22584.Flow_My_Tears_the_Policeman_Said
Time Enough for Love;Robert A. Heinlein;1973;1970;612;3.97;35957;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Speculative Fiction'];"From the New York Times bestselling author of Starship Troopers and the first Grand Master of Science Fiction...Lazarus Long 1916-4272The capstone and crowning achievement of Heinlein's famous Future History, Time Enough for Love follows Lazarus Long through a vast and magnificent timescape of centuries and worlds. Heinlein's longest and most ambitious work, it is the story of a man so in love with Life that he refused to stop living it; and so in love with Time that he became his own ancestor.";"*** 2024 reread - One of the greatest joys of my reading career has been the rediscovery of Heinlein’s later works. For years, decades even, I have had a tepid reception for the later third of the Grandmaster’s work, from I Will Fear No Evil in 1970 to his passing in 1988, comprising seven novels.It was not so much that I disliked the novels entirely, they just were not my favorites (though I will need to reread I Will Fear No Evil since I did dislike that one).The change was a progression. I did like some sections of his work, but was turned off by his over the top concentration with sex, and just wrote it all off as old man creepiness. But I reread many of his earlier juvenile works and also the non-fiction collection Grumbles From the Grave, with letters to and from his editors and publishers, compiled by his widow Virginia after his death. I realized that the hokey delivery so representative of Heinlein’s writing was a carefully crafted facade to soften the impact of his world shattering ideas and to create an approachable and endearing homely narration.Rereading his 1982 novel Friday, I then realized that what I had earlier taken for dirty old man syndrome, was a wink and nod orchestration of satirical attacks on fundamentalism and conservatism. Heinlein was using his time tested delivery to serve up some HAVE AT YOU! to the powers that be.Heinlein’s 1973 novel Time Enough For Love (nominated for the Nebula, Hugo and Locus awards) was a lengthy conglomeration of shorter works tied together with a framing story about recurring protagonist Lazarus Long and some of his adventures as told to archivists who interviewed the “Senior” after more than two millennia of the old rascal hopping from bed to bed across the universe. When I first read this I liked the stories but glossed over the framing story. With my new approach to his later writing, I paid more attention to the “between the lines” story and really enjoyed it now. BTW - Long has been described as having red hair, freckled skin and a big nose. Some have opined that Heinlein tailored the look to resemble L. Ron Hubbard, but for my own reasons I have always seen him as looking like Jimmy Buffett, a lovable rogue.What Heinlein has done is quite amazing. He has taken many mores, customs, rules and even laws about relationships, sex, gender, sexuality, child rearing and family structures and tossed them on a heap, sorted through them, threw out most and settled on a stripped down version of what works and for practical, pragmatic reasons, eschewing any held together merely for religious or conservative philosophy. He then presents the new morality against the older models and comments upon what works and why, and in his inimitable libertine country doctor fashion.Then, he saves up his piece de la resistance for the end, an all out, no holds barred, attack on one of the most revered institutions in all of Western Civilization, in a time travel trick that would make Larry Flint blush.Highly recommended to Heinlein fans, SF fans and maybe even to modern readers who are looking for fresh ideas in unlooked for sources. ***Robert A. Heinlein was also a visionary who saw the trends of Western Civilization and expounded out into a foreseeable future, not just in terms of science fiction but also in regard to cultures, morals, sociology and ideology. Time Enough for Love demonstrates the fundamental attractiveness of science fiction, the eternal hope that things will get better. Dystopian fantasies aside, science fiction deals with the future, and that there are people in the future still carrying on everyday lives. At its heart, science fiction is about hope, hope that we’ll see a few more years ahead. Time Enough for Love goes one step further and introduces us to Lazarus Long (though he was in prior Heinlein novels) as the oldest living human, over 2,000 years old. Thus, Heinlein allows us to imagine an almost eternal existence, and without the need to live at night and drink blood. I like reading Heinlein because I like Heinlein, chauvinistic and militaristic as he may be; he is also a libertarian humanist who loves life and tells a good story. He’s not misogynistic, he clearly loves women and sees them as capable and wonderful people. Heinlein’s voice, whether Lazarus Long, or Jubal Hershaw, is that of Heinlein himself, his experience is cast upon science fiction of the future. The best thing about Heinlein is that he is a good writer, a great writer of science fiction.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58306840-time-enough-for-love
The Word for World Is Forest;Ursula K. Le Guin;1972;1970;160;4.05;34469;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novella'];Dentro de la gran tradición literaria de las utopías y antiutopías que se inicia en el siglo XVII, El nombre del mundo es Bosque muestra una vez más la claridad y el poder de la visión «ecológica» de Ursula K. Le Guin: un universo dinámico y en equilibrio que se mantiene en el tiempo de acuerdo con leyes propias que no admiten la intromisión del hombre.En el planeta Atshe, el ciclo de la vida, la cultura, las costumbres, los procesos mentales nacen y se desarrollan en la estabilidad autónoma del cosmos, pero la llegada de una expedición terrestre cambiará dramáticamente el pacífico modo de vida de los nativos del planeta.;"Posted at Heradas Review1/23/2017 edit: The world lost an absolute literary giant today. If you haven't read Ursula K. Le Guin, do yourself a favor. She's fantastic.The Library of America just published these definitive hardcover collections of Le Guin’s Hainish Cycle novels and stories, which made my decision to finally start working my way through this classic series of speculative fiction that much easier. I’m going to be tackling these in no particular order, since my research shows that they’re only tertiarily connected to one another, but take place in a shared universe.The Word for World is Forest is a terrific novella, originally published in the Harlan Ellison edited Again, Dangerous Visions anthology in 1972. It went on to win the Hugo award for best Novella later that year. I believe it was very influential to James Cameron's Avatar (which I am now certain was constructed entirely from story elements and themes originating in Old Man's War & The Word for World is Forest). The novella also definitely influenced George Lucas’s Ewoks from Return of the Jedi, to such a degree that I think plagiarism is the better suited word.It's a social science fiction story, and a moralistic/ethical one with some wonderfully insightful and precient things to say about dangerous ideas entering the public consciousness. In this way it was perfectly suited for that Dangerous Visions anthology. My main takeaway from tWfWiF is that once a dangerous idea is out there for the first time, there is no turning back. It becomes a part of the public consciousness. Here, specifically that dangerous idea is the very concept of murder, introduced to the peaceful Athsheans by their human/yuman occupiers.I enjoyed the waking dreams that the Athsheans were capable of, and how deeply dreaming was ingrained into their culture and at such a foundational level. Especially when that was contrasted with how little the humans/yumans dreamt; how they had almost lost the ability altogether and required drugs to fully dream. It speaks volumes to how overworked and under-rested western, and specifically American culture has become. Assuredly, this has only become a larger problem since the seventies when this was written. Dreams are necessary, not only as moments of respite from our chaotic lives, but as catalysts for forward imaginative thinking. We need downtime in order to reset. Dreams fuel us and encourage us to create. What are we without dreams? Without the possibility to imagine something different?There was a great line in this book about how suicide harms those who live on, but murder harms the murderer herself. I really liked that. It may not be entirely true, but poetically, it was beautifully constructed. This story almost represents the antithesis of that sentiment, when the concept of murder enters the societal consciousness of the Athsheans, it continues to harm them after the fact, by perpetuating itself ad infinitum. It’s impossible to go back once innocence is lost. The Athsheans are forever changed by the invading yumans. Be cautious what you allow into your lives and societies.Okay, so onto the Ewok/Return of the Jedi connection:You've got a forest planet, filled with furry little creatures about a meter tall. They’re described as looking quite a bit like teddy bears. They live in the forest city named Endtor. Some of them were being used as slaves. They eventually rise up and decide to take on their occupiers, and reclaim their planet. All of their names are exactly 2 syllables long. Hmm… sounds a little familiar.Are you kidding me George Lucas? For real dude? It took about 9 years, but you massively ripped that concept off from Le Guin. You didn’t even scrape the serial numbers off it. If Le Guin were particularly litigious, she could probably get a percentage on all Ewok merchandizing past and future. She doesn’t strike me as the type to sue, and Disney is a bit of giant to go up against these days. Still, credit should be given where credit is due. The Ewoks originated in Le Guin’s mind, and she deserves the recognition.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276767.The_Word_for_World_Is_Forest
High-Rise;J.G. Ballard;1975;1970;208;3.61;34129;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Horror', 'Classics', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook'];"When a class war erupts inside a luxurious apartment block, modern elevators become violent battlegrounds and cocktail parties degenerate into marauding attacks on ""enemy"" floors. In this visionary tale, human society slips into violent reverse as once-peaceful residents, driven by primal urges, re-create a world ruled by the laws of the jungle.";"""A low crime-rate doctor,"" she told him amiably, ""is a sure sign of social deprivation.""Anthony Royal built the Titanic of skyscrapers.  

A state of the art, megalithic structure suitable for 2,000 tenants. It is a self-contained environment with everything a tenant would need such as shopping or exercise or even schools for their kids. The people the building attracts are white collar, well educated, professionals. The apartments sell out quickly and as everyone start to settle into their new lives glitches start to occur. Despite the developing problems entire floor parties are standard weekend entertainment. A bottle drops from a higher floor and shatters on Dr. Robert Laing's balcony and it is equivalent to the first canon fired on Fort Sumter. As the week continues more bottles are dropped and other assorted trash begins to fall from the sky. A rich jeweler plummets from his upper level apartment onto the roof of a car. Resentment is building between levels. The perceived richest people, where Anthony Royal resides, are on the upper levels. The middle level people, where Dr. Robert Laing reside, are resentful of the upper levels, but also becoming more disdainful of the lower levels. Richard Wilder, a man working on a documentary about human behavior, lives in the lower levels. The trash is accumulating on the ground floor, the trash chutes become jammed and more and more trash is being hoisted over the side of the building creating an intolerable situation for the lower tenants. Electricity winks out leaving entire floors without power for days at a time. ""Five floors were without electricity. At night the dark bands stretched across the face of the high-rise like dead strata in a fading brain.""The air condition goes out and when it does come back on it only trickles out for a few minutes before failing again. The lower levels bear the worst of the malfunctions with the upper levels remaining relatively unaffected. Resentments build and as tenants become more and more irritated the civilized structure of the building starts to erode. This is the point of the novel when J.G. Ballard asks the reader to suspend belief. Yes, he is creepy; and yes, he has a pink beach ball; and yes, he wants to play with your mind. 

The three levels of the building go to war with each other. People are beaten. Women are raped. Graffiti is sprayed on the walls. The building breaks down into tribal units with lower levels trying to conquer and take over higher levels of the building. ""Not for the fist time Laing reflected that he and his neighbors were eager for trouble as the most effective means of enlarging their sex lives.The problem I have is that the outside world is perfectly normal. Civilization is existing just fine. There is no cataclysmic event that has ruptured the natural order of things. To return to the world of order is as simple as leaving the building. These are highly educated people who have benefited greatly from living in a society that allows them to make money using their brains. I found it hard to believe that these people would so easily transition to a tribal warfare society. ""They discussed the latest ruses for obtaining food and women, for defending the upper floors against marauders, their plans for alliance and betrayal. Now the new order had emerged, in which all life within the high-rise revolved around three obsessions-security, food and sex.""This is the adults gone wild version of Lord of the Flies. I didn't like Lord of the Flies so maybe I just don't like books about mob culture. Ballard didn't sell me on this concept, not that I don't believe that intelligent, well educated people are incapable of marinating in the swamp juices of the lizard brain, but I didn't feel it would happen under the circumstances that Ballard presented. I am still curious to explore more in Ballard's world and I look forward to reading more of his work. I'll leave you with some parting thoughts from Doctor Laing.""Would he soon be the last person alive in the high-rise? He thought of himself in this enormous building, free to roam its floors and concrete galleries, to climb its silent elevator shafts, to sit by himself in turn on every one of its thousand balconies. This dream, longed for since his arrival at the high-rise, suddenly unnerved him, almost as if, at last alone here, he had heard footsteps in the next room and come face to face with himself.""If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12331767-high-rise
To Your Scattered Bodies Go;Philip José Farmer;1971;1970;220;3.93;32543;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Hugo Awards', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Adventure'];To Your Scattered Bodies Go is the Hugo Award-winning beginning to the story of Riverworld, Philip José Farmer's unequaled tale about life after death. When famous adventurer Sir Richard Francis Burton dies, the last thing he expects to do is awaken naked on a foreign planet along the shores of a seemingly endless river. But that's where Burton and billions of other humans (plus a few nonhumans) find themselves as the epic Riverworld saga begins. It seems that all of Earthly humanity has been resurrected on the planet, each with an indestructible container that provides three meals a day, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, a lighter, and the odd tube of lipstick. But why? And by whom? That's what Burton and a handful of fellow adventurers are determined to discover as they construct a boat and set out in search of the river's source, thought to be millions of miles away. Although there are many hardships during the journey--including an encounter with the infamous Hermann Goring--Burton's resolve to complete his quest is strengthened by a visit from the Mysterious Stranger, a being who claims to be a renegade within the very group that created the Riverworld. The stranger tells Burton that he must make it to the river's headwaters, along with a dozen others the Stranger has selected, to help stop an evil experiment at the end of which humanity will simply be allowed to die. --Craig E. Engler;The truly sad thing is that the concept is ingenious, such a brilliant idea of resurrection in a sci fa setting, but at the same time a total waste of a wonderful plot.I do think that this book is overrated, not really bad writing or something, but simply not worthy of being mentioned in a line with other great sci-fi and fantasy authors. Why?Plot, worldbuilding, and especially the charactersWell, the whole plot isn´t that great, worldbuilding is meh, the character development is duh, it´s just as average as it can be, as an adaption from a game or TV series without much love for detail, but definitively not a milestone. That´s tragic because It´s such a freaking cool ideaWith historic persons, the science fantasy combination, and good protagonists, this could have been a cult series. It would have appealed to many different groups of people, to fiction addicts as well as to history nerds. The reason is the tragic case of a Stradivari in the hands of a very average musicianOther authors made so amazing worldbuilding or character descriptions or in rare cases even both with such a fresh, unique setting, but Farmer quite kind of, I don´t know, didn´t care or, let´s face it, just didn´t have the creative writing education and talent? The solutions to problems are unrealistic, infodump is lurking around each corner, I can´t associate with the protagonists, and the ending is terribly unsatisfying. It seems as if the protagonists and the author don´t know why they are where and what they should do and what their motivation is and so they do illogical stuff for no reason, sigh, it simply makes no fun reading it. Just look at the ratings collapsing more and more with each part.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189147.To_Your_Scattered_Bodies_Go

Che per me è rimasta intatta anche tredici anni dopo, quando l’ho letto. Il mio primo Crichton.Alla luce dell’oggi probabilmente fa un po’ ridere. Ma credo succeda a tanta fantascienza che si affida molto all’aspetto scientifico: la scienza va avanti, cambia, e quello che oggi sempre una bomba domani rischia die ssere meno che un petardo.L’uomo terminale è interpretato da George Segal, attore che negli anni Settanta visse un periodo di splendore artistico.È chiaro che nel terzo decennio del terzo millennio, con il mondo dominato dall’intelligenza artificiale, il procedimento scientifico qui descritto fa ben meno effetto, è già stato superato (ma non risolto). È chiaro che con computer infilati in tasca o allacciati al polso pensare a un’intera stanza dedicata a un elaboratore elettronico di dimensioni pachidermiche nutrito con nastro perforato fa un po’ “mamma e papà”, un’altra generazione, ancor più un’altra epoca e un altro mondo. Matusalemme.È chiaro che immaginare il tutto con telefoni fissi, senza cellulari, senza pc, ma solo il mainframe IBM mammut…Il protagonista è un programmatore di computer, e forse perché soffre di epilessia, o forse perché lavora sui computer, è ossessionato dall’idea che le macchine vogliano conquistare il mondo: più pragmaticamente, la sua epilessia del lobo temporale gli causa improvvisi irrefrenabili raptus omicidi. Dei quali dimentica tutto completamente: nel senso che gli attacchi vengono seguiti da amnesia totale.Per curarlo, e salvarlo, decidono di impiantargli nel cervello una specie di pacemaker collegato a un computer che regoli, o anzi, blocchi in partenza gli attacchi epilettici, e quindi, disinneschi i raptus omicidi: un minicomputer dotato di elettrodi nel cervello che attraverso micro scariche elettriche possa controllare gli attacchi di violenza. In pratica, come dice il titolo, un terminale umano. Una periferica.Qualcosa va storto, nell’operazione, o nel progetto. Qualcosa va così storto che l’uomo diventa ancora più violento. E parte la caccia per acchiapparlo.Il film è del 1974 diretto da Mike Hodges.Già allora Crichton intuiva la possibilità di operare chirurgicamente a distanza utilizzando un computer come braccio del chirurgo… Come altri prima e dopo di lui, Crichton indagava sui limiti della scienza, sulle implicazioni morali di certe scoperte, sul controllo dello sviluppo scientifico.E se anche tante cose oggi sembrano superate, il thriller regge, ed emoziona, e si capisce che Crichton aveva vista lunga, e intuiva in anticipo gli sviluppi scientifici.I più potenti controllori mentali del mondo sono i genitori, e sono anche quelli che fanno più danno.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7679.The_Terminal_Man
Time and Again;Jack Finney;1970;1970;400;3.94;23626;yes;['Time Travel', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Mystery'];"One of the most beloved tales of our time!Science fiction, mystery, a passionate love story, and a detailed history of Old New York blend together in Jack Finney's spellbinding story of a young man enlisted in a secret government experiment.Transported from the mid-twentieth century to New York City in the year 1882, Si Morley walks the fashionable ""Ladies' Mile"" of Broadway, is enchanted by the jingling sleigh bells in Central Park, and solves a 20th-century mystery by discovering its 19th-century roots. Falling in love with a beautiful young woman, he ultimately finds himself forced to choose between his lives in the present and the past.A story that will remain in the listener's memory, Time and Again is a remarkable blending of the troubled present and a nostalgic past, made vivid and extraordinarily moving by the images of a time that was ... and perhaps still is.";"January 12, 2019 reviewMy year in books begins with a re-read of my favorite time travel novel, Time and Again by Jack Finney. Published in 1970, I'm happy to report that the book stands as a vivid parallel universe romance and labor of love from an author who was legitimately enamored by New York City of the 1880s. If I was sectioning off the best books to read each month of the year, this would also be a nominee for the Best of January, with a protagonist journeying to a Manhattan of frozen ponds and horse drawn sleighs the first month of the year. Though not a perfect trip, it is a wonderful one.Simon Morley, who for reasons that frustrate aesthetic delight insists on being called ""Si,"" is a twenty-eight year old art student from Buffalo who works as a graphic designer at an advertising firm on 54th Street. Si is a man of another time, having met his girlfriend Kate Mancuso at the antique shop she owns on Third Avenue, where Si enjoys picking through stereoscopeic slides from New York City of yesteryear. Then one Friday, watching the clock edge toward lunch, Si is visited by Ruben Prien, a project manager for a U.S. government program who without being able to divulge any details offers Si the opportunity for a great adventure. Arriving for his interview at a storage company warehouse on the Upper West Side, Si is taken to a room where after four minutes, he finds his application completed, several details in the room different from when he entered and Ruben claiming that twenty minutes have elapsed. Insisting that this is wrong and pointing out what's been changed, Si passes his test and is shown even stranger things. He sees instruction rooms, one with a woman learning the Charleston. Si is led onto a catwalk above a massive sound stage, where sets have been built, one of a Montana plain with Crow Indian teepees. Si meets the project director, a theoretical physicist named Dr. E.E. Danziger who believes that science has yet to catch up to everything Albert Einstein theorized.""He meant that we're mistaken in our conception of what the past, present and future really are. We think the past is gone, the future hasn't happened yet, and that only the present exists. Because the present is all we can see.""""Well, if you pinned me down, I'd have to admit that's how it seems to me.""He smiled, ""Of course. To me, too. It's only natural. As Einstein himself pointed out. He said we're like people in a boat without oars drifting along a winding river. Around us we see only the present. We can't see the past, back in the bends and curves behind us. But it's there.""""Did he mean that literally, though? Or did he mean--""""He meant exactly what he said. When he said light has weight, he meant that the sunlight lying on a field of wheat actually weighs several tons. And now we know--it's been measured--that it really does. He meant that the tremendous energy theoretically binding atoms together really could be released in one unimaginable burst. As it really can, a fact that has changed the course of the human race. He also meant precisely what he said about time: that the past, back there around the curves and bends, really exists. It is actually there."" For maybe a dozen seconds Danziger was silent, his fingers playing with the little red cellophane strip. Then he looked up and said simply, ""I am a theoretical physicist on leave here from Harvard University. And my own tiny extension of Einstein's great theory is ... that a man ought somehow to be able to step out of that boat onto the shore. And walk back to one of the bends behind us.""Danziger's project--comprised of fifty people and drawing on the services and resources of various branches of the government--have sought recruits with an ability to see things both as they are and how they might have been. After studying a specific time period and training on a sound stage, the recruit is placed in an environment that exists now as it did at that point in the past: a town in rural Vermont, the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris. Trained in techniques of self-hypnosis, the recruit then exits their location and steps out into the world of the past. Why? To prove it can be done.Si is offered the opportunity to travel to San Francisco of 1901, but the artist has another travel destination in mind: New York City, January 1882, where he wants to watch a letter mailed at the Main Post Office. Si's girlfriend Kate had a foster father who lived and died unable to solve a mystery surrounding the suicide of his father Andrew Carmody, a Wall Street financier who briefly served as an adviser to President Grover Cleveland. Whatever misery Carmody endured has to do with that letter, which was partially burned by his wife along with a suicide note that read ""That the sending of this should cause the Destruction by Fire of the Entire World ...""Disclosing his mission to Kate, Si's girlfriend helps him bone up on New York City of the 1880s. He's outfitted with period garb and an apartment at the Dakota building, a magnificent blockwide structure constructed in Central Park in the early 1880s. Si has only a few days to convince his subconscious that the world of eighty-eight years ago is the world outside his window and after wandering through the park during a blizzard, is certain that he did briefly return to the past. He tries again, only this time with Kate at his side, and at the clop of hoofs and a faint axle squeak, they encounter a horse drawn bus emerge from the snow.We didn't turn immediately; we couldn't quite bring ourselves to do that. But we heard the squeal of iron tires crunching cold dry snow, heard the loose wood-and-iron rattle of the body, and the crack of leather reins on solid flesh. Then, very slowly, we turned our heads to look again at the tiny, arch-roofed wooden bus with high wooden-spoke wheels, drawn by a team of gaunt horses, their breaths puffing whitely into the winter air at each step. It was closer now, filling our vision; and staring at it I knew now from where and when I had come. It took a moment of actual struggle for my mind to take hold of what it knew to be the truth: that we were here, standing on a corner of upper Fifth Avenue on a gray January afternoon of 1882; and I shivered and for a moment felt shot through with fear. Then elation and curiosity roared through me.What I love about Time and Again is how enamored Jack Finney is with time travel and stuck behind a typewriter in the late 1960s, with New York City of the early 1880s. This is a Manhattan Island covered by hundreds of acres of farmland, where Trinity Church is the highest point in the city at 284 feet and neither traffic signals or telephones are in use. Si records pages of interesting sights and while Finney does go overboard on detail, so would my report if I traveled back in time. Finney's use of weather--snow, ice, freezing cold--is a character in itself and adds tremendous atmosphere to the novel, particularly in the time travel scenes.I liked how Finney uses self-hypnosis as a catalyst for time travel. Richard Matheson used a similar device for Bid Time Return in 1975 but of the two novels, Finney's is vivid, exciting, researched (including photographs) and as a love story, more convincing. Traveling back alone, Si rents a room in the same boarding house as the man who mailed the letter and becomes enamored with the ill-tempered villain's fiancée, Julia Charbonneau. While I endorsed Si getting Julia away from the blackmailer she'd be miserable with, I wasn't sure whether this constituted cheating or not, whether what happens in the 1880s stays in the 1880s. Contemporary readers are bound to notice what I did and that is the male gaze which Si frequently employs whenever he encounters a woman. I was more restless over how long Si's recruitment went on and how long it took for him to go back in time. Finney puts almost as much thought into the time travel project as Michael Crichton does in Timeline; I did like how in his debriefing, Si is prompted to recount as many facts as he can to determine whether he has altered history. Finney ultimately questions whether the project has Crichton-like implications for disaster and resolves the novel thrillingly. My thesis: This novel holds up supremely well as imaginatively spun science fiction romance.Length: 129,242 wordsNovember 20, 2014 reviewThe next stop in my time travel marathon (November being Science Fiction Month) and by far the best yet is Time and Again, a little known but much loved 1970 novel by Jack Finney that handles a fantastic premise -- a government project sends a man eighty-eight years into New York City's past -- with more imagination, sensuality and logic than any time travel story I've read. This is a wonderful book that has just become one of my favorites.Simon Morley, known as ""Si"", is twenty-eight years old, an art student from Buffalo who works as a graphic designer for an advertising firm on 54th Street. Si is a man out of time; he met his girlfriend Kate Mancusco at the antique shop she owns on Third Avenue, where Si enjoys digging through stereoscopeic slides from New York City of yesteryear. Then one Friday, watching the clock edge toward lunch, Si receives a visitor. Ruben Prien is a project manager for a U.S. government program he revaeals very little about except to promise Si that he envies his opportunity to be offered an adventure as great as this.Si is invited to participate in some tests first and arriving for his interview in a complex disguised as a moving company warehouse on the Upper West Side, is shown many strange things. There are instruction rooms, one with a student speaking medieval French, one with a man in a World War I uniform training in bayonet combat, one with a woman learning the Charleston. Si is led onto a catwalk above a massive soundstage, where several sets have been built, from a neighborhood in the 1920s to a Montana plain with Crow Indian teepees. Si is finally taken to the employee cafeteria, where he's introduced the the project director, a theoretical physicist named Dr. Danziger.The old man asks Si how much he knows about Albert Einstein. Not much, Si replies, except that Einstein had bushy hair and was terrible at arithmetic. Danziger elaborates, ""He meant that we're mistaken in our conception of what the past, present and future really are. We think the past is gone, the future hasn't yet happened, and that only the present exists. Because the present is all we can see."" In other words, the past isn't gone. It exists and can be reached.Danziger's candidates, those with the ability to see things both as they are and how they could have been, are trained in techniques of self-hypnosis, and after rehearsing on a soundstage, are placed in certain environments -- a town in rural Vermont, a plain in Montana -- that have gone unchanged between now and some point in the past. Danziger has discovered a way to make time travel possible, just as Einstein theorized. Why? To prove it can be done.Si is offered the opportunity to travel to San Francisco in 1901, but the artist has another destination in mind: New York City, January 1882, where he wants to watch a man mail a letter at the Main Post Office. Si's girlfriend had a foster father who went through life unable to solve a mystery surrounding the suicide of his father Andrew Carmody, a financier who was an adviser of some sort to President Cleveland. The source of whatever misery Carmody was enduring had to do with that mysterious post, which was partially burned by his wife along with a suicide note that read ""That the sending of this should cause the Destruction by Fire of the Entire World ...""His mission disclosed to Kate, Si's girlfriend helps him study up on the history of New York City of the 1880s. The project rents him an apartment in the Dakota Building, one of the few available buildings in Manhattan that was standing in 1882. Over a period of several days, dressed in period garb, Si attempts to train his mind that the world outside his window is 1882. After many failed attempts and one false start, Si is visited by Kate, and the couple makes the attempt together. I've summarized 115 pages of Time and Again and would prefer to leave as much of the ensuing 285 pages a surprise as I can. One of the things that Finney does here that so many writers ignore is to stop and consider how traumatic the experience of time travel would be. It comes as an existential crisis, making travelers physically ill from the realization that they're now history, surrounded by people who were all dead a minute ago. The experience is not treated flippantly or as a plot point but given a gravitas that I see rarely in science fiction.As time travel speculation, Finney couldn't have chosen more elegant mechanisms than Einstein, the Dakota Building and self-hypnosis. Logically, it all makes sense. New York City of 1882 isn't a travel destination I'd have chosen, but Finney took history I'd never known and brought it to life: -- A New York City covered by trees and farms (the Dakota Building has been built so far out in the sticks that's how it earned the name ""the Dakotas"").-- Floors covered in tobacco juice, with spittoons as hit or miss as modern day men's urinals. -- Men gathering at the Western Union building on Broadway to set their pocket watches to noon as a red ball drops the length of a flagpole on the roof.-- The arm of the Statue of Liberty a landmark before the full statue could be erected on Ellis Island. -- Elevated trains pulled by small locomotives.-- Orphaned and homeless boys sleeping on hay barges in winter.As a native Texan who's never seen a real winter, I was particularly amazed by how vividly Finney utilizes snow, ice and freezing cold to advance his story, particularly Si and Kate's dramatic arrival in 1882 during blizzard conditions that obscure all indications of the present until the sound of a horse drawn sleigh announces their arrival in the past.The big ticket action sequence in the novel develops naturally from the characters and builds ferociously in a way it only could in the place and time of Finney's story. At no point in the action did I feel that Finney was taking 20th century plot devices and running his time travelers through them; the workings of New York City in 1882 seems to inform every decision. There were moments where I thought I was ahead of his story and knew exactly where Finney was leading me, possibly toward the paradoxes Ray Bradbury speculated about, maybe a twist ending reminiscent of The Twilight Zone, and in each instance, I was wrong. The triumph of the book is how well Finney takes modern day technology and marries it with the romance of the past. As endings go, Finney's ranks as one of most satisfying I've ever read. Time and Again is a novel that has worked its spell on enough players in Hollywood to be in perpetual development as a movie. Paul Newman & Joanne Woodward fancied making a film version in the 1970s before Newman passed the book to Robert Redford, who failed in his attempts to interest Sydney Pollack, George Roy Hill or Steven Spielberg and got close to directing it himself in the 1990s. The novel would make a great big screen fantasy romance, with any number of young actors able to fit into the lead roles.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40526.Time_and_Again

And suppose your friend went on to confess that he wasn't from around here at all, but rather from a small planet near Betelgeuse? And what if the world really did come to an end, but instead of being blown away, you found yourself hitching a ride on a spaceship with your buddy as a travelling companion?It happens to Arthur Dent.An ordinary guy from a small town in England, Arthur is one lucky sonofagun: his alien friend, Ford Prefect, is in fact a roving researcher for the universally bestselling Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ... and expert at seeing the cosmos on 30 Altairian dollars a day. Ford lives by the Guide's seminal bit of advice: Don't Panic. Which comes in handy when their first ride--on the very same vessel that demolished Earth to make way for a hyperspacial freeway--ends disastrously (they are booted out of an airlock). with 30 seconds of air in their lungs and the odd of being picked up by another ship 2^276,709 to 1 against, the pair are scooped up by the only ship in the universe powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive.But this (and the idea that Bogart movies and McDonald's hamburgers now exist only in his mind) is just the beginning of the weird things Arthur will have to get used to. For, on his travels, he'll encounter Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two-headed, three-armed ex-President of the Galaxy; Trillian, a sexy spacecadet he once tried to pick up at a cocktail party, now Zaphod's girlfriend; Marvin, a chronically depressed robot; and Slartibartfast, the award-winning engineer who built the Earth and travels in a spaceship disguised as a bistro.Arthur's crazed wanderings will take him from the restaurant at the end of the Universe (where the main dish of the day introduces itself and the floor show is doomsday), to the planet Krikkit (locked in Slo-Time to punish its inhabitants for trying to end the Universe), to Earth (huh? wait! wasn't it destroyed?!) to the very offices of The Hitchhiker's Guide itself as he and his friends quest for the answer to the Question of Life, the Universe and Everything ... and search for a really good cup of tea.Ready or not, Arthur Dent is in for one hell of a ride!";This mammoth of a book was a hell of an undertaking. After being harassed into reading it for 2.5 years, I have to say I am glad I did it, but gladder it's over and I can now read something I truly want to...and something not set somewhere along the space/time continuum.I found there to be constant peaks and troughs, some chapters or parts were brilliant and others were laborious to get through (I did have some significant and glorious naps while I read this!), and every time I thought I would just give it up it got better again. Then when I noticed how much into it I was, it dipped and was simply ridiculous to the point of annoying me and toying with the idea of throwing it out the window or at the tv.Everyone goes on about how genius it is, the humour, the imagination, the non-sequitors etc., but it seemed full of nonsense in some bits and almost as if Adams had no mental filter, thus resulting in verbal diarrhoea. Some parts are quite humorous but it rapidly descends into silliness and after about 300 pages of this roller coaster, it is soul-destroying. As soon as I've reached this conclusion it gets much better and I feel like I've been too harsh and my interest is maintained for 60 pages only to be thrown about again for another 40.I can see how the Hitch Hiker's Guide can be so absolutely loved by many, but in all sincerity it is not my cup of tea.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/372299.The_Hitch_Hiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy
Woman on the Edge of Time;Marge Piercy;1976;1970;376;3.92;17615;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Feminism', 'Time Travel', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction'];After being unjustly committed to a mental institution, Connie Ramos is contacted by an envoy from the year 2137, who shows her a utopian future of sexual and racial equality and environmental harmony.But Connie also bears witness to another potential outcome: a dystopian society of grotesque exploitation. One will become our world. And Connie herself may strike the decisive blow...;"It’s interesting how the lens of three decades of life experience can sharpen the focus of certain stories—and even parts of stories. When I first read Woman on the Edge of Time not long after it was published (1976), I was barely into my 20s and already a reliable cog in the corporate machine. At that time, I enjoyed Marge Piercy’s story of a 37-year-old Chicana woman in New York whose already-complicated life takes a twist for the bizarre when she begins to communicate with an ambassador from the year 2137, but I found little to identify with personally beyond the yearning for a more egalitarian, utopian world. I read the book again when I was around the age of the main character, Consuela Ramos, and found considerably more to love—and ponder. I had naively thought when I first read the book in the late 70s that sexism, racism, and ethnocentrism were on the wane—outmoded concepts that were slowly but undeniably going the way of other counterproductive human behaviors like burning witches at the stake or equating nonconformity with insanity. Silly me. The 80s and 90s taught me otherwise, so that by the time I dipped into Woman in the late 90s, I realized how prescient some of Piercy’s observations were. And when I reread the book yet again recently, I finally found the story far richer and more nuanced than in any of my earlier readings. I am a gay single mother in my 50s who, after a severe depressive episode, has seen the inside of a mental institution. The short-term unit at McLean is a country club for harmless sadsacks compared with the more Cuckoo’s Nest setting Connie finds herself in, to be sure, but it’s a nuthouse all the same. So during this reading I found myself especially attuned to Connie’s treatment by “the system”—the way her story of the actions that led to her second commitment are ignored and read as denial and evidence of illness; the emphasis on orderly obeisance and lecturing over individual therapy and understanding; the easy assumption that “noncompliance” is dangerous and must be crushed. To be fair, I did not encounter frightened, uncaring staff during my brief stay, but it is still true that patients rarely if ever see actual doctors. At best they see counselors in group settings, but most interactions are with nurses, technicians, and pharmacists—just as they were in Piercy’s 1976 hospital.  Those insights were critical in this recent reading of the book. The first time I read the book (I was a kid, remember!), I tended to believe that Ramos was indeed schizophrenic, and that she had created a very inventive but allegorically instructional alternative world to hide out in to escape the roughness of the real world. After the second reading I had no doubt that she had in fact been communicating with and visiting the world in 2137, and that her brave actions at the end of the book played a critical role in averting a disastrous future. But after this latest most recent reading, I have a different conclusion: it doesn’t matter. The book works either way, because it is above all character study, a deeply introspective look at community, evolution, survival, identity, and connectedness. Past reviewers have called the future world a “feminist utopia,” but this is hardly accurate. What they seem to be responding to is the idea that this future shows a world in which capitalism is not the driving force. It’s true: men are not in charge. But neither are women. Everyone is on charge, in turn. It’s not even socialism but communal living taken to a grand scale and extreme. It’s a world where everyone matters and is listened to, which is why it is important that Connie is not just some average housewife or middle management executive or a neurosurgeon: Connie is the epitome of the voiceless, ignored part of society—the people we brush off as “nuts” and consider less worthy of our full attention. This is not to say that Piercy is suggesting that everyone wearing a foil hat is tuned into reality and we are all fools for thinking them crazy; rather, she is contrasting what can happen when one set of people assumes graceless power over another and refuses to listen, to allow them to contribute or make their own sometimes-bad choices. It’s about what could happen if we accept totalitarianism. As an aside, I was amused to see that several reviewers considered the book dated—not the “present” period, mind you, which they accepted as a quaint period piece, but the imagined future of 2137. What we all forget too easily is that in the time since this book was written we have been barraged by a high-tech cinematic view of the future that almost invariably depicts our fate as increasingly electronic, automated, and conformist. Woman was written after the original-Star Trek series but predates the movies, the spin-off, and flashy movies like the Star Wars, Alien, and Terminator franchises. And the book helped spawn a generation of the alternative cyberpunk view of the broken, dystopian future that gave us Bladerunner and Mad Max. But realistically, none of us knows what the world will be like 125 years from now. Would we have imagined in 1887 that we could cruise down a highway at 80 mph talking to loved ones around the world through an earpiece? That our conversations at busy intersections and streets would be monitored and captured on camera without our knowledge? That pilotless drones would crisscross vast territories collecting data and firing weapons aimed by people on different continents? To think that we have any more insight into what will still be “normal” in 2137 is hubris.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/772888.Woman_on_the_Edge_of_Time
Star Wars: A New Hope;George Lucas;1976;1970;247;4.05;17307;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Adventure', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"Luke Skywalker challenged the stormtroopers of a distant galaxy on a daring mission - where a force of life became the power of death!
Luke Skywalker was a twenty-year-old who lived and worked on his uncle's farm on the remote planet of Tatooine ... and he was bored beyond belief. He yearned for adventures out among the stars—adventures that would take him beyond the farthest galaxies to distant and alien worlds.But Luke got more than he bargained for when he intercepted a cryptic message from a beautiful princess held captive by a dark and powerful warlord. Luke didn't know who she was, but he knew he had to save her—and soon, because time was running out.Armed only with courage and with the light saber that had been his father's, Luke was catapulted into the middle of the most savage space war ever ... and he was headed straight for a desperate encounter on the enemy battle station known as the Death Star!";"Everything, here begun!
I have bought the Omnibus edition with the three original “Star Wars” movie novelizations but I’ve chosen this edition to make a better focused review of each single book.
A LONG TIME AGO…
This is the novelization of that movie that a long time ago changed the way that Hollywood does films, maybe you have heard about it (unless of course, you have been frozen in carbonite for more than 40 years), since there is the far far away chance that you have never watched the movie, but definitely you must have heard about it!Star WarsIt was known just like that, Star Wars, at the beginning, but with the incoming of the rest of movies, TV series, novels, comics, etc... soon enough, it turned to be known as Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope.But hey! Episode Four?! Then why am I beginning with the fourth episode in the series?!Because it’s Star Wars……changing everything, even the way to tell stories (not to mention of re-inventing how the speciall effects would be done from then on).And nowadays (2018) is more alive than ever!OK, now, if you are of those frozen in carbonite and never having watched the movie, I warned you of NOT keep reading since there will be some kind of spoilers…
WHAT’S DIFFERENT IN THE BOOK THAN THE MOVIE?
Well, first of all, no, George Lucas didn’t write the book (and to have balance in the Force, no, Gene Roddenberry didn’t write Star Trek: The Motion Picture novelization neither), but what both books have in common is that they shared the same “ghost writer” (and no, it wasn’t a Force ghost!), Alan Dean Foster, known novelist, popular writer of novelizations, and a staple name in sci-fi literature.But don’t make a revolution about it, since it’s obvious that good ol’ Georgie indeed made the script (after several drafts, at least four official ones, and maybe more unofficials), so Alan Dean Foster made the “translation” of the crude screenplay to a prose novel format, and I can tell you that it was a really good work, nothing to envy from any other prose novel out there.So, what’s new in the prose novelization that there wasn’t in the movie (counting the Special Editions’ additions)?Well, nothing much that relevant, I can mention the infamous scenes of Luke watching from ground with (some absurdly good) binoculars the space battle between Leia’s ship and Vader’s Imperial Destroyer; along with Luke’s conversation about it with his Tatooine’s young pals, including Biggs Darklighter. Oh, and a cool comment by the X-Wing Leader saying that he flew along with Luke’s daddy (wink, wink), so he trusted that Luke must be as good as fighter pilot.And that’s pretty much it,……BUT WAIT!!!Also, Foster could correct some wide-known mistakes or polemic topics, like… …C-3PO commenting that the Princess wouldn’t be able to escape this time and later saying that he didn’t know who was the girl in the hologram, now in the prose novel the reference is done about the ship’s captain that he would be the one not able to escape this time. …droids weren’t allow to get aboard escape pods, so there is now logical that those good ol’ Imperial officers couldn’t conceive that any other kind of intelligent form were in what it seemed like an accidentally ejected escape pod.…Darth Vader is mentioned as a Dark Lord of the Sith, while in the original movies, the term was never used, and it was untile the prequel trilogy that the term was widely coined.…General Kenobi weren’t in direct service of Leia’s father, but the Old Republic.…Han Solo shot first, oh yeah!…Tarkin didn’t bother to go over to Dantooine, since even if it would be a real active Rebel Base, it would be too far away of the main space routes to serve as an effective visual testimony of the Death Star’s power to infuse fear in the Core Worlds of the Galactic Empire, so Alderaan was going to be the intended target not matter what.…Han Solo argues how the heck Leia would be able to pay her rescue if she wasn’t rich anymore (lacking of a planet).…Chewie got his medal, oh yeah!And many other things, here and there.Of course, also there are things that they are STILL WRONG due changes during the making of the movie, while good ol’ Alan was far far away, typing his novelization at home, like……it’s said that Leia’s consular ship was warned to stay away of the space sector where the Imperial Starfleet was dealing with the Rebel Spies (true, this is something rather new due Rogue One, but still I mention it, since it’s like an “obligation” of not respecting previous continuity, canon or not).…there is an odd paragrah indicating that Darth Vader has been in service of more than one emperor, and while Palpatine is mentioned, it’s not said that he’s a Sith too.…old Ben Kenobi doesn’t remember of being owner of astromech droids (poor R4-P17 and R4-G9 must be twisting of indignation in their graves (yes, I know, it was a prequel thing, but still)), and even there is problematic comment indicating that R2-D2 model is “too modern” for having being already in service during the old Clone Wars.…more than a mistake, it’s quite odd that in the prose novelization, the scene of the Death Star firing against Alderaan isn’t developed, so you have to read “between lines” to understand that fact. Even Obi-Wan Kenobi didn’t feel in the Force the sudden death of all those billions of Alderaanians.…the climax of the lightsaber battle between Obi-wan Kenobi and Darth Vader is too much vague and you can’t get what really happened at the end of it. …the stuff made by the Red Team in the movie, it’s done in the book by the Blue Team (besides the thing with Rogue One, this was a forced change while filming the movie, since the blue screen was troublesome to work with X-Wing maquettes painted with blue stripes). The Gold Team is referenced as simple Yellow, Also there is mention of a Green Team.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/599090.Star_Wars
Tau Zero;Poul Anderson;1970;1970;190;3.83;15211;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Space', 'Time Travel', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];The epic voyage of the spacecraft Leonora Christine will take her and her fifty-strong crew to a planet some thirty light-years distant. But, because the ship will accelerate to close to the speed of light, for those on board subjective time will slow and the journey will be of only a few years' duration.Then a buffeting by an interstellar dustcloud changes everything. The ship's deceleration system is damaged irreperably and soon she is gaining velocity. When she attains light-speed, tau zero itself, the disparity between ship-time and external time becomes almost impossibly great. Eons and galaxies hurtle by, and the crew of the Leonora Christine speeds into the unknown.;"Anderson has in Tau Zero, more than any other book I have ever read or heard about, created a sense of unimaginable isolation and otherworldliness.I am sure there is a list on Goodreads about books that must be read by a true science fiction fan, and Tau Zero by Poul Anderson should be on such a list. Anderson was a physics major in college and this background provides a meaningful foundation for what is a great science fiction book. Perfect? No, there is some thin characterization (usually a fatal flaw in my estimation) and apparently, according to many of the other reviews on Goodreads, there are even many questions raised by his science. But like so many of Anderson’s novels, his ideas, the premise of his story, overshadows the technical deficiencies of the book. To his credit, Anderson approaches a very science heavy book with a humanistic flair, and ultimately this is more about group dynamics than about a scientific expedition. A recurring theme in Anderson’s work is an individual or group standing and performing admirably against great odds, an “us against the world” element. Anderson also has a rare gift for taking an idea to its extreme; here he has taken the conceptual foundation of the novel’s conflict to a distant horizon whose scope may never before have been imagined.Tau Zero is the story of the journey towards colonization of a far distant planet. The voyagers undergo an adventure through space and time of incomprehensible complexity. First published in 1970 and nominated for the Hugo Award but lost to Larry Niven’s Ringworld, this is wildly influential and scores of writers have leaned heavily upon Anderson’s example. If you are a reader of science fiction, this one should either be in your “read” shelf or “to read”; it’s that good.[image error]";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240617.Tau_Zero
Mind of My Mind;Octavia E. Butler;1977;1970;224;4.18;13845;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Novels'];For 4,000 years, an immortal has spread the seeds of a master race, using the downtrodden as his private breeding stock. But now a young ghetto telepath has found a way to awaken -- and rule -- her superhuman kind, igniting a psychic battle as she challenges her creator for her right to free her people.;"4/5 starsOne of the best sci-fi sequels I have ever read.Quick reminder: There are two ways to read Octavia E. Butler's Patternist series: the order in which it was published--Patternmaster (1976), Mind of My Mind (1977), Survivor (1978, disowned and never put back into publication), Wild Seed (1980), and Clay's Ark (1984); or the chronological order of the in-universe story--Wild Seed (set in the 1600s and 1700s), Mind of My Mind (set in the 70s, contemporary for when Butler wrote it), Clay's Ark (set in a futuristic dystopia....of 2021), Survivor (set in space and on another planet), and Patternmaster (very far future where humanity is divided). I have chosen to read it in the chronological order at the advice of a friend and because I prefer to read it that way.Doro and Anyanwu, now called Emma, from Wild Seed are still alive in 1970s California. Doro is still building his ""empire"" of his super-powered descendants, switching bodies, and siring children through his own daughters and granddaughters. Emma is still shifting her body and seems, to my great dismay, to have accepted Doro's plans. But now, something is changing among their super-powered children and grandchildren. Mary, a biracial daughter (and technically granddaughter. BLECH!) of Doro, has gone through the transition and acquired her telepathic powers and she's the most powerful telepath Doro has seen in centuries. So powerful, that after she reaches out her mind to some of Doro's other descendants, she forms a psionic link with them all. She is able to exchange strength with them, and them with her. She can learn their other non-psychic abilities inherited from Emma's line.However, Doro notices how powerful Mary is getting. He remembers the last time one of his descendants became powerful and how disastrous the result was. Mary is aware of her power and influence as well, but she doesn't want to be like Doro. She can't be. Mary must protect her Patternists from Doro and herself, but Doro knows all and sees all.Perhaps this is just because of the order I've been reading this series in, but Mind of My Mind was one of the best sequels I've read. It's not perfect, and I'll get into those errors in a bit, but the way Butler is expanding this world and the overarching messages she wishes to convey is phenomenal.Mary was an interesting protagonist to follow. From the youthful and riotous age of nineteen to her early twenties, we see how she grows in both maturity and understanding her world along with growing in her powers. The constant struggle she ahs with herself, and Doro, is that she is not like Doro. She builds his empire and uses her powers to connect with people and to control others and becomes just as strong and intelligent as him. But is she really like him? In the beginning, Mary is as forceful and self-centered as Doro is, though not as heartless or sadistic. She has to put people in their place and make them obey her. Sometimes she turns a blind eye to the cruel things other's do, such as her husband Karl mentally controlling a young woman into staying with him and making her have sex with him and Doro. Yeah...Mary may be no Doro, but she's not a completely flawless person. And perhaps that is Butler's point with people, regardless of who they are, who have the power to control others' lives. I do appreciate that, when Mary started to pull away from Doro's ideals, Butler did not go the gender essentialist route. Mary doesn't become a parasite like Doro predicted for her and is himself. Mary has a symbiotic relationships with her Patternsits and they with her and each other. Butler does not chalk this up to Mary being a woman and Doro being a man; as we do see Mary being parasitic in the beginning and Doro has been in women's bodies before and has still continued his plans. Anyone and everyone can be a parasite or a symbiote. Although Mary and her fellows Patternists take the center stage, we do see more of Doro and Emma/Anyanwu here; mostly Doro. As I said before, Emma has decided to help with Doro in his eugenic empire, which, despite knowing the ending of Wild Seed was disheartening. She still shows great concern for Mary's growing power and the expansion of the Patternists along with the telepaths starting to control non-psychic people, or mutes as they're called. In fact, Emma even likens this controlling of mutes to the controlling of Black people albeit mutes of all races are psychically ""enslaved"" in the book. Doro of course doesn't really care about that, only about how the Patternists are growing. Here, he prefers to his original methods: siring children rather than pushing latent psychics through transitioning. Transiting is still as dangerous as it was in Wild Seed. And to boot, some of Doro and Emma's lines have ended up in weak and unstable latents whom Doro prefers killing off or letting them die by their own hands. It pure eugenics reconstructed in an interesting but very messed-up way.Control is the main theme of this book. We are reminded that Doro was from ancient Nubia, but we get more of his backstory here. His people were under the oppressive rule of the Egyptians and he was a sickly boy who first transferred unknowingly and unwillingly into his mother's body then his father's. Some parts of his memory are missing, but he switched into many bodies under the Egyptians' rule and travelled throughout North Africa. All Doro has ever known is controlling other people's lives. Butler, however, thankfully does not dispense any sympathy for Doro because of this. He is cold and calculating as ever, caring very little for life. Mary and Doro's control of the other members of their family and the mutes is normalized in their eyes--though Mary becomes somewhat resistant to it--and thus becomes normalized to the readers. Butler still shows how disturbing this is, but also shows how those who control are unbothered by it. It is interesting that the primal antagonist is Doro, a Black man. Well, he was born a Black man but has switched bodies with men and women of all races throughout his life. Was Butler trying to say that power can corrupt anyone? Is it a criticism against Black men who become patriarchal like White men who already control much of the world? The book does not shy away from racism, as Jan, one of Mary's Patternists, is shown to be quite racist in the beginning of the book. But, in another interesting twist, Doro does not seem concerned with race or considers himself apart of any race. In a flashback with a much younger Mary, Doro states this, but Mary counters since he was born Black, that he is Black. Is this a warning about color blindness and/or assimilation? I'm not sure, but it is thought provoking. So, despite loving this book, I could not give a complete 5 stars. I think this is one of those books that could've benefitted to be a little bit longer to flesh out some other issues. The pacing is quick, not a problem itself, so it's a quick read but some things were left underdeveloped. Some of the other members of Mary's Patternists First Family--Seth, Ada, Jesse, Rachael, Jan--were left without proper development or complete character arcs. As mentioned, I said that in the beginning Jan was racist, though towards the end of the book she seems to lighten up and accept her place among the family. Why would Mary be okay with such a racist in her Pattern? How did Jan get over her racism? Did she and Mary talk behind the scenes? It's just a quick sudden change. Seth could've been the most interesting, especially after Mary helps his latent brother Clay--and given the next book is entitled Clay's Ark, there might be a connection--but he just goes on pursing Ada off page. Rachael was the one from whom Mary eventually learned her healing abilities, and she was probably the most developed of the others, learning to find her place among the Patternists, but after that is done she just becomes so minor of a character. Ada and Jesse have some interesting stories showing how the Pattern controls mutes, but they don't go anywhere with their development much.The ending of the book is my favorite kind: bittersweet. I won't say what exactly happens, but comeuppances are made but not without sacrifice. One pivotal and beloved character decides to end their life at the end. Mary keeps her Patternists close to her, but not without realizing how she has faltered in her ideals to get there. People are safe at the end, but it feels like things are about to change and that the future will be uncertain.I can't wait to continue this series.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116254.Mind_of_My_Mind
The Futurological Congress: From the Memoirs of Ijon Tichy;Stanisław Lem;1971;1970;149;4.18;13407;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Polish Literature', 'Dystopia', 'Humor', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];The Futurological Congress is the fourth satirical science fiction novel in the Memoirs of Ijon Tichy series from Kafka Prize–winning author Stanislaw Lem.“Nobody can really know the future. But few could imagine it better than Lem.”— Paris ReviewBringing his twin gifts of scientific speculation and scathing satire to bear on that hapless planet, Earth, Lem sends his unlucky cosmonaut, Ijon Tichy, to the Eighth Futurological Congress. Caught up in local revolution, Tichy is shot and so critically wounded that he is flashfrozen to await a future cure—a future whose strangeness exceeds anything the congress conjectured.Translated by Michael Kandel.“A vision of Earth’s future where the authorities dose the population with ‘psychemicals’ to make life in a desperately over-populated world worth living.”— Boston Globe;"""Books are no longer read but eaten, not made of paper but of some informational substance, fully digestible, sugar-coated. A few grams of dantine, for instance, and a man goes around with the deep conviction that he has written The Divine Comedy. -Stanislaw Lem, The Futurological CongressA short novel narrated by cosmonaut Ijon Tichy, a kind of futuristic Alexis de Tocqueville who shares his travel report and diary beginning at a convention of world futurologists held at a space age hotel in Costa Rica where he has a room one hundred floors above the street. Tichy is as clearheaded as Thomas Jefferson or Isaac Newton, a well-educated gentleman with an impeccable moral sense. Too bad Tichy isn’t living in the eighteenth century age of reason rather than the twenty-first century of the future where the entire world has gone mad on mass ingestion of every variety and kind of weird pills to alter mood and even weirder chemicals to twist, bend, rotate and transform the mind. This was my very first Stanislaw Lem and it certainly will not be my last. Did the author coat the corners of the book’s pages with hallucinogens for me to lick? Sometimes, as I turned the pages, I thought such a practice would have been most appropriate. In a similar spirit, below are a batch of psychic hits, eight strobe light flashes, of what a reader will encounter with Lem's spectacular, speculative loop-the-loop: Kill the Pope: At a hotel bar, one where an all-girl orchestra plays Bach while performing striptease to the rhythm of baroque music, a burly, bearded bloke sticks his double-barreled rifle under cosmonaut Tichy’s nose and asks how he likes his papalshooter. Big Beard then goes on to explain how he is flying to Rome to shoot the Pope, what he terms “Operation P” in the spirit of Abraham and Isaac in reverse (rather than father killing son, he's son who will kill father). And, turns out, this guy is a devout and loyal Catholic! The sole reference to religion in the novel. Thank the Lord! – with devotion like this, who needs fanatics?Future Writers: The hotel is also hosting a banquet for Liberated Literature, where loudspeakers play: “Now to make it in the arts, publicize your private parts! Critics say you can’t offend ‘em with your phallus or pudendum.” And later on Tichy bumps into Harvy Simsworth, a writer who turns fairy tales and classic literature into hardcore porno - Ali Baba and the Forty Perverts, King Leer, what Snow White really did with the seven dwarfs, what Jack really did with Jill. Just in case anybody thinks our current day degenerate literature couldn’t get any more debased and debauched. Something in the Water: Back in his hotel room Tichy's good mood begins to soar higher and higher by the minute. Even though he cracks his head on the furniture, the lights go out and he can’t get the telephone to work, Ijon Tichy considers his hotel room one of the nicest in the world. He could hug, caress and kiss his worst enemies. But when he laughs with uncontrollable hilarity with how “the butter might splutter and make the flame gutter,” Ijon senses something is amiss. Ah, of course! The glass of water he drank from the bathroom tap. Our rational cosmonaut is given his first glimpse how those in power will attempt to manipulate and control the population – mind-altering chemicals. Japanese Proposal: The futureologists are treated to Hayakawa’s plan for the house of the future: eight hundred levels complete with schools, shops, theaters, museums, sports fields, special gymnasiums for group sex, catacombs for nonconformists, rotating apartments to alleviate boredom, recycled food such as artificial bananas, gingerbread and shrimp made from, well, I’ll spare you Hayakawa’s detail. Oh, my goodness, living in housing like this (if you call this living), no wonder people eagerly reach for mind-expanding, feel good drugs. I think I’d do the same. Kaboom!: A number of spectators in the upper seats listening to Hayakawa’s grand scheme evidently had a similar reaction: someone hurled a Molotov cocktail into the hall. Levelheaded Tichy flees to safety and reads the local newspaper the following day: “I was amazed to find articles full of saccharine platitudes on the theme of the tender bonds of love as the surest guarantee of universal peace – right beside articles that were full of dire threats, articles promising bloody repression or else an equally bloody insurrection.” Our cosmonaut reasons that some journalists have been drinking the water and some not. Pandemonium: The violence escalates beyond the hotel. The government acts quickly, dropping LTN bombs on the undesirables. The results are not as anticipated – LTN stands for Love Thy Neighbor and some of the bombs hit their own riot police. Ijon Tichy witnesses: “Before my eyes policemen tore the masks from their faces and, shedding copious tears of remorse, fell to their knees and begged the demonstrators for forgiveness, pushing the billy clubs into their hands with fervent pleas to be severely beaten."" Escape: All hell breaks loose and Ijon and several other futurologists seek refuge down in the city’s sewer system. Among the many things they encounter are enormous sleek rats walking in single file on their hind legs. Ijon pinches himself, wondering if he is hallucinating. Nope – all of what he is experiencing is as real as real. Well, maybe. Utopia/Dystopia: After a sequence of rescues from the city sewer system and the rats, after surgery and having been kept in deep freeze for years, Ijon is defrosted and wakes up in 2038. Ah, he can experience for himself humankind’s future New York City. Ijon quickly discovers chemicals to induce artificial worlds (psychems) are all the rage, how the city kids and teenagers are so considerate and sweet (that’s certainly a switch!), the weather is determined by vote, and how a plethora of words and expressions are new, new, new, new: threever, pingle, hemale, placize, cobnoddling, snthy and dozens more. If you enjoy language and wordplay, you will LOVE this Stanislaw Lem novel. On second thought, I think I’ll do a reread and lick the pages now and then. I’d advise you do the same.

Together they must learn to share control of her body. Mind versus body, Masculine desires versus feminine appeal. And soul versus soul. And when a third soul joins them the situation becomes even more fantastic. . .;I have often wondered where was the point of no return, the line of demarcation when Robert A. Heinlein left his brilliant work of the 1960s and began his slow descent into weirdness and dirty-old-manity. I think that line exists in I Will Fear No Evil, published in 1970. True, there was some creepiness prior to this (Stranger in a Strange Land) and there is also some fine writing after this (segments of Time Enough for Love – Job: A Comedy of Justice – and parts of The Cat Who Walks Through Walls) but Heinlein never came back to the glory days.Heinlein is one of the all time greats, one of my personal favorite writers, but I could not bring myself to finish this one.

Dhalgren;Samuel R. Delany;1975;1970;836;3.77;11610;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Novels'];"A mysterious disaster has stricken the midwestern American city of Bellona, and its aftereffects are disturbing: a city block burns down and is intact a week later; clouds cover the sky for weeks, then part to reveal two moons; a week passes for one person when only a day passes for another. The catastrophe is confined to Bellona, and most of the inhabitants have fled. But others are drawn to the devastated city, among them the Kid, a white/American Indian man who can't remember his own name. The Kid is emblematic of those who live in the new Bellona, who are the young, the poor, the mad, the violent, the outcast--the marginalized.";"Oh thank any higher power that’s listening — this endless book is over. This book Everest has been finally climbed, and looking down from that conquered peak all I have to say is — that was so not worth it. It’s exhausting, offputting, self-indulgent monotonous tedium of odd unpleasantness and pointless unwashed sexcapades stretched over a length of a doorstopper. It’s opaque and vague and basking in its own supposed cleverness rooted in surreal fog of confusion. If you think you’ve figured out how books are supposed to work — that is, questions posed and questions answered, plots that are comprehensible if you pay attention, and really a moment of feeling, after the book is done, that it was worth the effort — think twice. Yeah, Dhalgren marches to the sound of its own tune, and I suspect it’s making up that tune on the spot.Delany does warn you that this book will be nothing like you’d expect. The problem is, that warning smugly comes 93% into an 800-page tome.
“My life here more and more resembles a book whose opening chapters, whose title even, suggest mysteries to be resolved only at closing. But as one reads along, one becomes more and more suspicious that the author has lost the thread of his argument, that the questions will never be resolved, or more upsetting, that the position of the characters will have so changed by the book’s end that the answers to the initial questions will have become trivial.”
For reasons unclear, Dhalgren has the reputation of a SF masterpiece, but it’s not even in the neighborhood of science fiction. Now the neighborhood of postmodernist navel-gazing meandering exploration of unwashed grimy sex, mindless violence, odd fetishes that at some point will certainly include bodily fluid and filthy body parts, occasionally interspersed with bouts of literary criticism soliloquizing — well, that’s more or less where this lands.
 “Very few suspect the existence of this city. It is as if not only the media but the laws of perspective themselves have redesigned knowledge and perception to pass it by. Rumor says there is practically no power here. Neither television cameras nor on-the-spot broadcasts function: that such a catastrophe as this should be opaque, and therefore dull, to the electric nation! It is a city of inner discordances and retinal distortions.”
And yes, there are fascinating ideas and glimpses of brilliance — but they really seem more of an occasional filler between tedious graphic and exceedingly more and more unpleasant sex scenes and inexplicable (even to himself) adoration of a very mediocre protagonist who supposedly has that good/bad duality but for me was nothing but an unremarkable yet awful person.
‘Look,’ Kid glumly contemplated the difficulties of rape (a surprising memory of his arms filled with the bloody boy; he moved his feet back together) and wondered what Glass was contemplating—‘if you just stop yelling we can discuss this a little; you might change your mind—‘
Get yourself a second shoe, Kid. Nobody cares about your half-shod symbolism.And the moment a peripheral character puts our protagonist down was the only moment in the book that brought me sheer joy for about ten seconds.
 “Tak once told me you were as old as he is—two years older than me! Kid, most of the people here think you’re seventeen or eighteen! That, along with the poor man’s Hell’s Angel bit, and all the gossip about the various kinky things you get into—people are just here for the show. As far as most of them are concerned, Brass Orchids is like a performance by a talking dog. They find it so cunning that he speaks at all, they couldn’t care less what he actually said.”
I was almost hoping that after 800 pages maybe some sort of book Stockholm syndrome kicks in and I would find myself captivated by this oppressively strange world — but nope, I remain immune to any charms this book may have. Maybe I’m just not sophisticated enough to “get” it, but after the arduous exhausting journey of reading this book, I simply no longer care. Goodbye, Bellona, and good riddance.If not for my buddy read partner, I don’t think I would have made it through this. Thanks, Kevin!1.5 stars (half a star for it being the author of Babel-17).

But he discovered that hidden on the planet was the Kaiburr crystal, a mysterious gem that would give the one who possessed it such powers over the Force that he would be all but invincible. In the wrong hands, the crystal could be deadly. So Luke had to find this treasure and find it fast....;This book is very basic, by-the-numbers sf--but with the added thrill of being written right after A New Hope came out. Thus, the entire story is about Luke and Leia's sexual tension. Sure you always intended them to be siblings, Lucas. Sure.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35204.Splinter_of_the_Mind_s_Eye
The Fabulous Riverboat;Philip José Farmer;1971;1970;231;3.87;10839;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Audiobook'];"In To Your Scattered Bodies Go, Philip José Farmer introduces readers to the awesome Riverworld, a planet that had been carved into one large river on whose shores all of humanity throughout the ages has seemingly been resurrected. In The Fabulous Riverboat, Farmer tells the tale of one person whose is uniquely suited to find the river's headwaters, riverboat captain and famous Earthly author Sam Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain). Clemens has been visited by ""X,"" a mysterious being who claims to be a rebel among the group that created Riverworld. X tells Clemens where he can find a large deposit of iron and other materials that Clemens can use to build the greatest riverboat ever seen. Since there is virtually no metal on the planet, it will also give Clemens an unbeatable edge when it comes to battling the various warlike societies that dominate the Riverworld. But Clemens is not alone in his quest for the iron, which arrives on the planet in the form of a giant meteorite. In fact, Clemens is besieged on all sides by forces determined to seize the precious ore, leading him to make a deadly pact with one of history's most notorious villains, John Lackland. Lackland's crimes during his reign as king of England were so hideous that no other English monarch will ever carry his name, and he's up to equally nefarious tricks on Riverworld. However, Clemens has a guardian angel in the form of Joe Miller, a giant subhuman with a big nose, a serious lisp, and a cutting wit. Miller has also been to the very headwaters of the river, where he saw a mysterious tower in the middle of the North Sea and where the creators of Riverworld are thought to reside. He will be an invaluable ally in completing the riverboat and sailing to the headwaters, but even an 800-pound giant may not be enough to help Clemens fulfill X's mission. --Craig E. Engler";The second in the strange yet captivating Riverworld series where every person born on Earth is resurrected on a different, distant planet. Imagine the questions asked but not the answers given, a pretty place of nearby impressive mountains thrusting into the azure skies, green grass sprawling to the limits of the eye and the rolling ubiquitous blue river seems unfathomable. And who pops out in this globe the perfect candidate ...Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens) the Mississippi River boat pilot and sometimes writer. However also the despicable King John the British monarch of the Magna Carta fame , is it proper to state not a good guy? The most imposing individual by far is an unknown human in history Joe Miller a species before the Neanderthal ...800 lbs. in weight a giant of immense size and power who brings fear, destruction and death to his opponents the few that do not run fast and Mr.Clemens best friend. Which makes the not brave author feel very contended, as the behemoth swings his huge ax in the turbulent land. Too many wars commence even for Mr. Miller to strike all down as enemies fall they soon arise in the vast planet some millions of miles away. However Mark Twain has a dream if only he with the help of his many friends could build a paddle wheel boat and float it up the stream to discover the secrets of this crazy existence and talk to the Ethicals as the aliens call themselves, who constructed ...whatever this is, a man can dream ? All through the narrative are sprinkled historical figures like Lothar von Richthofen , younger brother of the Red Baron, Goring the Nazi shows up from time to time after numerous deaths preaching the new Second Chance religion. Most shocking Twain's wife Olivia now with the swashbuckler Cyrano de Bergerac, think how devastating the husband feels . But to all those hapless creatures on the sphere the universe is always barbaric, never turn your back to John Lackland. Any reader that likes something outside the norm and thirst for adventure and doesn't care about the real and chooses a less traveled road your walk begins when you open this book. That is the great premise of the story any human or close approximation will literally out of nothing appear and the consumer is grateful, the bad is how to get there...If only a brainy billionaire would make a huge rocket for us to go there, I can dream too .;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16536.The_Fabulous_Riverboat
Protector;Larry Niven;1973;1970;218;4.06;10765;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Novels'];A classic novel of known spacePhssthpok the Pak had been traveling for most of his thirty-two thousand years. His save, develop, and protect the group of Pak breeders sent out into space some two and a half million years before . . .Brennan was a Belter, the product of a fiercely independent, somewhat anarchic society living in, on, and around an outer asteroid belt. The Belters were rebels, one and all, and Brennan was a smuggler. The Belt worlds had been tracking the Pak ship for days—Brennan figured to meet that ship first . . .He was never seen again—at least not by those alive at the time.;Larry Niven proves a point here. Most other authors would be tempted to tell a story of this magnitude in a trilogy consisting of thousands of pages. Niven does it in a little over 200 pages. Granted, he keeps the featuring cast down to only a few individuals. But still…The saga of Brennan the Belter and Phssthpok the Pak seems to enjoy a bit of cult status, and it’s easy to see why. It’s an enjoyable enough tale, with some nice surprises to keep things spicy. It also gets fairly technical, with what was probably at the time the oddest space warfare tactics in Science Fiction. It's a true science-y SF classic. The explosion at the Galactic Core, a plot event featured in many of Niven’s Known Space novels, is also mentioned here. Plus, if you have read the Ringworld novels you will be no stranger to the Pak Protectors. Lots of fun and highly recommended.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100344.Protector
Dreamsnake;Vonda N. McIntyre;1978;1970;312;3.87;10749;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Hugo Awards', 'Audiobook', 'Speculative Fiction'];In a far-future, post-holocaust Earth, a young healer named Snake travels the world, healing the sick and injured with her companion, the alien dreamsnake. But she is being pursued. . . .;"I abandoned this at about page 183. Why? I fully admit much of it is me, in this particular mood in my life at this moment. But some of the responsibility needs to go to McIntyre for writing what 100% seems like Women's Sci-Fi, 1970s-Style. Call it the Female version of Dune. Not to mention the novel-length 'plot' feels a great deal a series of short stories strung together into a novel. It turns out that my feeling was not inaccurate; the book sprung out of an award-winning novellete. What's Women's Sci-Fi, you ask? Oh, it's simple stuff; it's the stuff that's about being a female and owning (female) power. In the 1970s, it also includes sexual inequity, possibly insta-love with a man who struggles with women's equity, and quite probably about rape. It's always about being a biological and gendered girl in a structure that resembles the Quest of the (Male) Hero. If I sound dismissive, it's only because I grew up in heavily genderized sci-fi and it appears that I can't even revisit it for long. It reminded me a bit of Carol Nelson Douglas' Six of Swords series.So the premise is that this woman, nicknamed 'Snake,' is a healer, who uses her specially bred snakes and healer training to basically create individually tailored vaccines and cures. It's pretty fucking brilliant for 1978, I have to say. Here we are, 2021 and CAR-T engineered cells are all the rage for curing cancer, which is essentially the same idea. At any rate, best I can guess, these 'dreamsnakes' actually come from alien/foreigners to the world who are holed up in a city that is controlled by a wealthy, hierarchical system. Shocking, I know.This newly-minted healer is out, far past anywhere known to her, the post-apocalyptic wastelands, bringing vaccines and healing to the people trying to make a living on the edges of the world. Unfortunately, something not unsurprising happens to her dreamsnake, at almost the exact moment she forges a deep and lasting insta-love, and she's left somewhat bereft. Traveling happens, followed by an interlude with a trio of traders, where we can see how a three-way relationship may work. Then travel and an interlude at a village where the headman has been bold enough to ban indentured servitude but is blind to its inequities in his own enclave. We probably learn something about how awful and unequitable male relationships can be in this section. Back at the farm, the insta-love has decided to set off in pursuit of his object. The best thing I can say about this is that he's portrayed in a very typically 'feminine' way, being very family-minded, relatively powerless and a caretaker spirit. Yay. Then we set up the encounter with a 'madman.' I've no doubt I would learn some other thing about how generally male-female dynamics are abusive and sucky at this point, as the 'madman' uses the girl she rescued as an emotional lever.What I've learned in my old age is that the most insidious chains are the ones we apply ourselves. I appreciate the consciousness-raising, of a sorts, and the idea that Snake is the hero in her own story. But the actual story-telling is too weak, and the plot points are too tired and familiar for me to want to stay in the world any longer, because it's not going anywhere I haven't already been.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263021.Dreamsnake

This Perfect Day;Ira Levin;1970;1970;368;3.99;10028;no;['Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"The story is set in a seemingly perfect global society. Uniformity is the defining feature; there is only one language and all ethnic groups have been eugenically merged into one race called ""The Family."" The world is ruled by a central computer called UniComp that has been programmed to keep every single human on the surface of the earth in check. People are continually drugged by means of regular injections so that they can never realize their potential as human beings, but will remain satisfied and cooperative. They are told where to live, when to eat, whom to marry, when to reproduce. Even the basic facts of nature are subject to UniComp's will - men do not grow facial hair, women do not develop breasts, and it only rains at night.""The Family"" was everywhere. For centuries, mankind longed for a world without suffering or war. The Family made that dream come true. They have triumphed. Programmed, every need satisfied, they knew nothing of struggle or pain. They had mastered... perfected Earth.But for one man, perfection was not enough. For Chip, it was a nightmare. The Family was a suffocating force of evil. His dream was to escape... and destroy!";ReckoningWritten in 1969, this dystopian classic from Ira Levin delves into the social science curiosity of political/social structure and population subservience. In a totalitarian society with mass surveillance, mandatory drug treatments, and complete control of everyone's job, pastime, partner, friends and lifespan, a central intelligence system called Uni, is all powerful.Chip is the main protagonist, his nameber (not misspelt) is Li RM35M4419, and since the great Unification everyone is part of The Family, and their world does not know aggression, sadness, regret, hatred, greed, and poverty. Their lives, however, do not experience curiosity, choice, love, or freedom, and if there are signs that any of these emotions or thoughts exist, the monthly Treatment will likely irradicate them through higher drug doses or a few more potent drugs to bring members back into line. The relaxed and uninhibited nature of reporting on colleagues, family, and friends was unsettling and considered the duty to help treat a sickness. Through this process, Chip starts to feel guilt over the information he already provided about others and starts to withhold information from his advisor.Chip works in the Institute of Genetic Engineering and we realise from the appearance of members of the Family that gradually the physical appearance of all the World’s races are slowly being genetically consolidated. He works as a genetic taxonomist, has his treatments once per month, performs dispassionate sex on a Saturday, communicates regularly with his advisor, and visits his parents twice per year. He notices himself becoming more creative and questioning in the last few days before his monthly treatments but when he returns after treatment he is once again a compliant member of the Family and can put the previous few day’s ‘sickness’ behind him.Chip is approached by a group of free thinkers who explain how he can fool the system and become free to think throughout the month and do things beyond what is deemed acceptable. The more Chip learns, the more he wants to know and he explores ways of escaping or overcoming the control of Uni. Some people are ‘incurable’ and it is believed they live on Islands remote from The Family.This Perfect Day is an allegory illustrating that peace and security in life are possible if we forego, choice, privacy, individuality, and the capacity to create, imagine and love in all its different ways. The worst in our human nature may well lead us on a path to destruction and we can ruminate whether the ultimate price of compliance to Uni, is a price worth paying. There is, however, something in our nature that fervently refuses to consciously give up Our Freeeeeeeeeeeedom (as William Wallace would say).Ira Levin’s novel is a profound book that explores what we understand by the individual and its uniqueness, and how totalitarian regimes exert control and diminish the individual. It seems as we look at the World today, that while we seem incapable of securing all the requirements of how politics and society should behave for equal rights and opportunity, but we need to treasure the aspects that mean most. This was a Buddy read with Julie. Her insights and discussion proved invaluable in fully appreciating this novel, not only because of its philosophical nature but also because it is an entertaining story with adventure, drama, relationships, and interesting characters. I would highly recommend this book and also thank Julie for her patience and discussion.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139390.This_Perfect_Day
Patternmaster;Octavia E. Butler;1976;1970;208;4.03;9819;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic'];The combined mind-force of a telepathic race, Patternist thoughts can destroy, heal, rule. For the strongest mind commands the entire pattern and all within. Now the son of the Patternmaster craves this ultimate power, He has murdered or enslaved every threat to his ambition--except one. In the wild, mutant-infested hills, a young apprentice must be hunted down and destroyed because he is the tyrant's equal... and the Pattermaster's other son.;"Patternmaster by Octavia E. Butler is a mix of Ursula LeGuin and Robert Silverberg, with a nod to Frank Herbert. The coolest thing about this very good read is Butler’s ability to create a world intrinsic to itself; the author has crafted a unique, distinctive culture that is alien to us but contextually correct for the world she has built. Butler’s biography denotes a strong, singular personality and this comes through in her writing. Many books can boast a strong female lead, and Butler’s women are not only strong but also brutally honest with themselves and with the central male protagonist. Butler also explores themes of interdependence, social status and even slavery. These complex characterizations and intricate group dynamics provide a greater depth and maturity to what is a fine science fiction story to begin with.If you enjoy SF/F or any variation of speculative fiction, you NEED to read Butler's work.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116256.Patternmaster
The Inverted World;Christopher Priest;1974;1970;239;3.94;9552;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction'];The city is winched along tracks through a devastated land full of hostile tribes. Rails must be freshly laid ahead of the city and carefully removed in its wake. Rivers and mountains present nearly insurmountable challenges to the ingenuity of the city's engineers. But if the city does not move, it will fall farther and farther behind the optimum and into the crushing gravitational field that has transformed life on Earth. The only alternative to progress is death. The secret directorate that governs the city makes sure that its inhabitants know nothing of this. Raised in common in creches, nurtured on synthetic food, prevented above all from venturing outside the closed circuit of the city, they're carefully sheltered from the dire necessities that have come to define human existence. Yet the city is in crisis. People are growing restive. The population is dwindling. The rulers know that, for all their efforts, slowly but surely the city is slipping ever farther behind the optimum. Helward Mann is a member of the city's elite. Better than anyone, he knows how tenuous is the city's continued existence. But the world he's about to discover is infinitely stranger than the strange world he believes he knows so well.;"With Inverted World Christopher Priest has written a work that is beautiful, powerful and profound. These are the words of critic, scholar and science fiction writer Adam Roberts. Equally important, at least for me as someone unacquainted with science fiction, is that Mr. Priest has written an accessible and enjoyable novel. And part of the enjoyment was having my imagination challenged and expanded - I felt like I do after finishing a rigorous workout, only, in this case, my mind had the workout. Honestly, what a book, one I recommend especially for readers who do not usually read science fiction. More specifically, here are several call-outs:NARRATIVE VARIATIONThe novel is divided into five parts, alternating back and forth between first-person and third-person – our first-person narrator is main character Helward Mann, a newly initiated apprentice guildsman of the city. Helward is pitch perfect as narrator since, in a very real sense, his story is the city’s story. Third-person part two and four underscore and clarify the challenges facing Helward and his city. A most effective narrative devise to drive the story and draw us into its unfolding drama.PACE OF A MEDIEVAL-LIKE CITYAlthough science fiction in that the city is of a future time and must continually move by way of a system of tracks, cables and wenches toward an ideal point termed ‘optimum’, pacing of the day-to-day activities of the city are much akin to a city in twelfth century Europe. Matter of fact, compared to the high octane writing of Philip K. Dick, Inverted World reads like science fiction in slow motion, which is exactly the appropriate speed to make this story accessible, especially for those of us who ordinarily do not read science fiction.MEDIEVAL-LIKE GUILDSThe workings of the guild system was founded by the city’s founder, one Destaine. The guilds involve the specifics of surveying, laying of tracks, bridge building, securing cables and winching – all of the nitty-gritty of enabling the city to continue moving north. The guilds are exclusive and regimented and central to the overall government of the city. And the guildsmen take their guilds seriously, very seriously. All members have the mindset and work ethic comparable to members of those esteemed medieval guilds.CONFLICT OF SOCIETIESBut, alas, the inhabitants of the moving city are not alone. There are hostile, half-starving tribes in the lands outside the city. And to add further complication, the city engineers need men from these various tribes to contribute to the heavy, backbreaking work involved in clearing land and laying track. And even more complication: the city must barter for the services of the tribeswomen. A nasty business to be sure.JOLT OF THE WEIRDSo, we as readers join Helward moving along at the slow, methodical speed of medieval-like time for the entire first half of the novel. Then it happens: the jolt of the weird. I wouldn’t want to say anything more specific here but let me assure you, as a reader you will be every bit as shocked and jolted as Helward. Such is the high quality of Christopher Priest’s writing. At this point and beyond, the plot thickens, warps and bends.PHILOSOPHY OF PERCEPTIONWe are familiar with George Barkley’s “To be is to be perceived.” Well, on one level Inverse World is a meditation on perception within the science of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Would we be upset and disoriented if we realized the way we have been perceiving the world and the physical objects contained within – the sun, the directions of north, south, east, west, the size and shape of those around us -- is completely false? You bet we would. Welcome to the bending space of an inverse world that plays with our mind.MATHEMATICS AND MODERN SCIENCEEven a non-scientist like myself can see the author includes enough math and science to keep nearly everyone with a background in science both challenged and engaged. As a for instance, here’s a reflection from an outsider to the city: “In time a kind of logical pattern appeared . . . but there was one ineradicable flaw in everything. The hypothesis by which the city and its people existed was that the world on which they lived was somehow inverted. Not only the world, but all the physical objects in the universe in which that world was supposed to exist. The shape that Destaine drew – a solid world, curved north and south in the shape of hyperbolas – was the approximation they used, and it correlated indeed with the strange shape that Helward had drawn to depict the sun.”BREAKTHROUGH OF THE ETERNALAt one point well into the tale, Helward reflects, “I did my guild work as quickly as possible, then rode off alone through the future countryside, sketching what I saw, trying to find in line drawing some expression of a terrain where time could almost stand still.” In a way, this is remarkable since the mindset of the inhabitants of the city, including the guildsmen, is totally practical – every drop of ingenuity and effort is geared to sheer, brute material survival. Within the city walls there is no reference to religion, philosophy, literature or the arts – to put it bluntly, these people lack a spiritual and aesthetic dimension. Yet, remarkably, through a stroke of artistic creativity, Helward touches the realm of the eternal, which is perhaps a consequence of being set free from the pull of the city. One theme worth keeping in mind.SOBER CITYThe people of the city deal with life without powerful drugs, hallucinogenic or otherwise. They are a sober lot, not even beer or wine. No Dionysian frenzy; no dancing; not even the singing of songs within the city walls. In this sense, very different from our own world. However there are a number of challenges and problems the people and the city face that will have a most familiar ring. But this book is much, much more than simply social and cultural commentary. Christopher Priest has written a work of extraordinary vision, one to expand your mind and hone your imagination, and even if you become slightly warped in the process, exercising your grey matter will be well worth the effort.This New York Review Book (NYRB) Classic contains an informative Afterward written by John Clute, providing historical and social context for Priest’s writing. This edition also has a nifty, eye-catching cover sculpture by artist/futuristic designer, Lebbeus Woods.(Special thanks to Goodreads friend Manny Rayner for clarifying for me the scientific ideas contained within this novel before I wrote my review).Christopher Priest, Born 1943, British Novelist and Science Fiction Writer";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/142181.The_Inverted_World
A Maze of Death;Philip K. Dick;1970;1970;192;3.81;9306;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Religion', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];Fourteen strangers come to Delmak-O. Thirteen of them were transferred by the usual authorities. One got there by praying. But once they arrived on that treacherous planet, whose very atmosphere seemed to induce paranoia and psychosis, the newcomers tound that even prayer was useless. For on Delmak-O, God is either absent or intent on destroying His creations. At once a wrenching metaphysical thriller and an ingenious meditation on the nature of divinity, A Maze of Death is Philip K. Dick at his most dizzyingly provocative.;"""A million stars burst into wheels of light, blistering, cold light, that drenched her. It came from behind and she felt the great weight of it crash into her. ""Tony,"" she said, and fell into the waiting void. She thought nothing; she felt nothing. She saw only, saw the void as it absorbed her, waiting below and beneath her as she plummeted down the many miles. On her hands and knees she died. Alone on the porch. Still clutching for what did not exist.”― Philip K. Dick, A Maze of Death If you are a fan of PKD’s fast-paced craziness hop aboard. Here’s the setup: Over the span of two months, traveling one or two at a time in one-way rocket ships, fourteen men and women are transferred to the planet of Delmak-O to live as a small community in isolation. When the last of the colonists lands, they all anxiously huddle around a transmitter to listen to a General Treaton explain the reason for their assignment. Unfortunately, right at the critical point when their mission's purpose is about to be explained, the transmitter goes haywire and no further communication is possible, either giving or receiving. Oh, no! No defined goals, no more contact; no more rocket ships - now they are truly isolated. Also unfortunate is the fact not one of these men or women has a shred of community spirit; quite the contrary, they are all antisocial in the extreme. But fortunate for readers, the more unsociable and unfriendly their behavior, the more color and flair and weirdly provocative twists contained in the story, an entire cornucopia, as we follow the zigzag of their cockeyed misadventures. To share a more specific taste of this novel's uniqueness, here are nine specimens of PKD exotic fruit:Seth Morley – A marine biologist who receives timely advice from a Walker-on-Earth to switch from his chosen noser (small one-way rocket) for flight to Delmak-O, a noser called the Morbid Chicken. Wow! To be saved by a higher life form - Seth is most grateful. Little does Seth know, once on Delmak-O, circumstances will propel him into the role of an Indiana Jones-style hero following a couple of other harrowing episodes: being sexually assaulted by the big breasted Susie Smart and shot by plastics technician Ignatz Thugg. Ah, community.Sacred Text – For these denizens in PKD’s futuristic world, not the Bible but A.J. Specktowsky’s How I Rose From the Dead in My Spare Time and So Can You is held in reverence, a book containing such quizzical theology as: “God is not supernatural. His existence was the first and most natural mode of being to form itself.” As PKD himself states in his Forward, the theology in A Maze of Death is not like any one known religion; rather, as science fiction author, he developed his own system of religious thought predicated on the fickle assumption that God exists.Prayer – If you were going to pray, would you need a transmitter where you could attach conduits to permanent electrodes extending from your pineal gland? Would you pray to an Intercessor or something akin to a manufacturer that’s called a Mentifacturer? This is exactly what Ben Tallchief and the other colonists consider before submitting their prayers.Form Destroyer - The nature of this nasty, negative character is uncertain. Even Specktowsky admits his origin is unclear – impossible to determine if he is a separate entity from God or if he is created or uncreated by God. But one thing is for certain – the colonists must deal with the presence of the Form Destroyer, particularly after the spooky death of one of their number on Delmak-O.Maggie Walsh - A theologian who has an after death experience that begins by her seeing iridescent colors mixed into light that travel like some oozing liquid forming itself into buzzsaws and pinwheels that creep upward, moving from her toes to her head. She hears a menacing voice calling her skywards. These images and sounds then morph into a bizarre sequence of stunning patterns and supernatural spectacles. In his Forward, PKD informs us how Magggie Walsh’s after death visions come from one of his own LSD trips in exact detail. One of the highlights of the novel, to be sure. Wade Frazer - A psychologist inclined to continually analyze his fellow disgruntled colonists. At one point, Wade Frazer reports: “My preliminary testing indicates that by and large this is an inherently ego-oriented group.” Is it any surprise Wade is the least popular among those assembled on Delmak-O? The tench – A gelatinous cube out in the wastelands of Delmak-O that mysteriously can answer questions written down on a piece of paper placed in front of it. But once, faced with a question posed by Seth Morley: “The great globular mass of protoplasmic slush undulated slightly, as if aware of him. Then, as the question was placed before it, the tench began to shudder . . . as if, Morley thought, to get away from us. It swayed back and forth, evidently in distress. Part of it began to liquefy.” Morley and the other colonists know they are in store for an extra dose of weirdness. The Building – Looking like an eight-story factory, a cube-like building in the hinterlands of Delmak-O. From various reports, it could be anything from a mental hospital to a wine distillery. Some of the exploring colonists, wishing to get to the bottom of their mission’s purpose, think it wise to enter the building, others not.The Last Two Chapters – Keep in mind this is PKD. What is really happening to all these colonists and why are they continually loosing numbers, either by killing one another or dying and disappearing in strange ways? Is some kind of thought experiment being conducted? Are they to mull over the implications of dilemmas like Brain in a Vat or John Searle’s Chinese Room or Robert Nozick’s Pleasure Machine? If your imagination is up for a few stirring jolts, I urge you to read this novel to find out. ""The same force that shut down the transmitter,"" Ignatz Thugg said. ""They knew; they knew if he phrased the prayer it would go through. Even without the relay."" He looked gray and frightened. All of them did, Seth Morley noticed. Their faces, in the light of the room, had a leaden, stone-like cast. Like, he thought, thousand-year-old idols.Time, he thought, is shutting down around us. It is as if the future is gone, for all of us.”― Philip K. Dick, A Maze of Death";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216399.A_Maze_of_Death
Titan;John Varley;1979;1970;309;3.95;9054;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Aliens', 'Speculative Fiction'];When Cirrocco Jones, captain of the spaceship Ringmaster, and her crew are captured by Gaea, a planet-sized creature that orbits around Saturn, they find themselves inside a bizarre world inhabited by centaurs, harpies, and constantly shifting environments.;"*** 2024 reread - First read in HS so this is about a 40 year gap between readings. If anything, this is much more enjoyable the second time around.I’ve read lots of fantasy writing over the past 40 years and I’m up here on my magic mushroom to state emphatically that Varley’s world building here is some of the best in this genre.To sum up the surface story: a ragtag crew is out by Saturn, investigating what was thought to be a moon, because its that big, but its some kind of construct (reminiscent of Clarke’s Rama) and then they are attacked by the thing and then they are off on a WILD adventure inside the construct which is several powers of MASSIVE and there are also different kinds of sentient lifeforms, and some of the crew can mysteriously communicate with the beings, and then there is a meeting with a very mysterious entity, really very very cool fantasy.The Hugo award voters considered this one and the sequel, Wizard, for the best novel award and I really enjoy his writing as well. He’s got PKD level imagination but without the over the top schizophrenia or amphetamines crazed urgency. What my man Varley lays down is a smooth high fantasy but grounded in level headed approach.We also see some exceptional dialogue and characterization, focused mainly on our protagonist Cirocco Jones. Varley describes her as a larger than life adventure hog but also demonstrating real leadership qualities. The interactions between the earthlings and the Titan creatures was maybe the best thing about this, besides just the sheer imaginative AWESOMENESS.Highly recommended for fantasy readers; though we notice some 70s disco sensibilities, this has actually aged rather well.[image error]";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49838.Titan
Man Plus;Frederik Pohl;1976;1970;215;3.74;8456;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Space', 'Classics'];Ill luck made Roger Torraway the subject of the Man Plus Programme, but it was deliberate biological engineering which turned him into a monster -- a machine perfectly adapted to survive on Mars. For according to computer predictions, Mars is humankind's only alternative to extinction. But beneath his monstrous exterior, Torraway still carries a man's capacity for suffering.;"Just as Frederik Pohl’s 1977 novel Gateway was about greed, Man Plus, his 1976 offering, is about ambition, and may be seen as an almost Kafkaesque allegory. Pohl brings an approachability to his very competent hard science fiction; a pleasing meld of technically believable sci-fi with humanistic and psychological elements. He tells a good story – especially with an interesting, and ongoing (though ultimately not very satisfying) theatrical irony theme crafted with a mysterious narration technique. With the frequent references to over-population it is vaguely reminiscent of Brunner’s Stand on Zanzibar. Overpopulation and Malthusian restrictions were also a theme in Gateway, perhaps a recurring element in Pohl’s fiction. This is a scientifically sound book, too, both astronomically as well as biologically, at least within the artistic license afforded a sci-fi writer. With a destinational setting of Mars, Pohl competes with science fiction royalty in thin air, but of course, the far side benchmark is still the great Ray Bradbury who shrugged aside any scientific considerations and may have written a line like “they got in the rocket and went to Mars”. Pohl succeeds with full and complex characterizations that make this a far better read than it would have been if put together by a less skilled writer. Unfortunately this joins China Mieville’s Perdido Street Station in the category of great books that have an almost disastrously disappointing ending. Even with this consideration, this is still a very good book";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/367215.Man_Plus
The Female Man;Joanna Russ;1975;1970;214;3.47;8065;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Feminism', 'Classics', 'Speculative Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Gender'];It has influenced William Gibson and been listed as one of the ten essential works of science fiction. Most importantly, Joanna Russ's THE FEMALE MAN is a suspenseful, surprising and darkly witty chronicle of what happens when Jeannine, Janet, Joanna, and Jael—four alternative selves from drastically different realities—meet.;"I've seen people argue, both here and elsewhere, that this book is outdated and no longer topical. I'm really confused what rose-colored glasses they're wearing, because as far as I can tell, the majority of this book is still far too true. I've been in these places far, far too often to write off the circumstances in this book as some so flippantly have.""Give us a good-bye kiss,"" said the host, who might have been attractive under other circumstances, a giant marine, so to speak. I pushed him away. ""What'sa matter, you some kinda prude?"" he said and enfolding us in his powerful arms, et cetera--well, not so very powerful as all that, but I want to give you the feeling of the scene. If you scream, people say you're melodramatic; if you submit, you’re masochistic; if you call names, you're a bitch. Hit him and he'll kill you. The best thing is to suffer mutely and yearn for a rescuer, but suppose a rescuer doesn't come?Sure, we don't have men telling us that we ""belong"" at home any more (or at least not as often). There are women in the army now, female firefighters, women working in construction and architecture and mathematics. But how many women are in active combat? Zero. How many women run Fortune 500 companies? ALMOST Zero (fewer than 5%). There’s still a significant disparity of women in mathematics and the sciences. We still can’t play “male” sports. We're reduced to breasts and our sex more often than even we want to admit. We're still, after all this ""liberation,"" confined to the role of Chopin's ""Mother-women"" strikingly often.In college, educated women (I found out) were frigid; active women (I knew) were neurotic; women (we all knew) were timid, incapable, dependent, nurturing, passive, intuitive, emotional, unintelligent, obedient, and beautiful. You can always get dressed up and go to a party. Woman is the gateway to another world; Woman is the earth-mother; Woman is the eternal siren; Woman is purity; Woman is carnality; Woman has intuition; Woman is the life-force; Woman is selfless love. ""I am the gateway to another world,"" (said I, looking in the mirror) ""I am the earth-mother; I am the eternal siren; I am purity,"" (Jeez, new pimples) ""I am carnality; I have intuition; I am the life-force; I am selfless love."" (Somehow it sounds different in the first person, doesn't it?)Honey (said the mirror, scandalized) Are you out of your fuckin' mind?But the worst part about this--the most terrifying aspect of this book--is that the sentiment this book calls out still lay barely below the surface of, at the very least, American culture (being American, I really can’t speak to the rest of the world with much knowledge). We claim to be a ""post-feminist"" society, but patriarchal thinking still lurks beneath, and it takes very little prodding to bring its apologetics to light, in both men and women. It’s somehow worse that we think that this is all past us, I think, because by pretending it doesn’t exist, we’re simply letting it live. We’re letting the monster continue its devouring cycle, eating us all as we go about our lives, like the invisible aliens sucking away human brains in “They Live” that only those with the goofy glasses could see. I’m a sick woman, a madwoman, a ball-breaker, a man-eater; I don’t consume men gracefully with my fire-like red hair or my poisoned kiss; I crack their joints with these filthy ghoul’s claws and standing on one foot like a de-clawed cat, rake at your feeble efforts to save yourselves with my taloned hinder feet: my matted hair, my filthy skin, my big fat plaques of green bloody teeth. I don’t think my body would sell anything. I don’t think I’d be good to look at. O of all diseases self-hate is the worst and I don’t mean for the one who suffers it!Women are still considered ""inadequate"" in so many circumstances. Our own autonomy and ability to make decisions for ourselves regarding basic medical procedures and life choices is still not only questioned, but those rights are actively being stripped on a regular basis. And when we dare to say, ""how dare you!"" we get slapped in the face. We get laughed at. We get told our concerns are ludicrous. And that’s without taking into account societies that still exist where women can be jailed for driving. The countries where mutilation of women is still allowed and accepted. Where wives are still bought and exchanged as property, where they can be beaten and bred like livestock.But sure, we’re post-feminist. Really. Alas, it was never meant for us to hear. It was never meant for us to know. We ought never be taught to read. We fight through the constant male refractoriness of our surroundings; our souls are torn out of us with such shock that there isn't even any blood. Remember: I didn't and don't want to be a ""feminine"" version of the heroes I admire. I want to be the heroes themselves.What future is there for a female child who aspires to being Humphrey Bogart? I wish this book were much more outdated than it is. I wish I didn't see my own experiences in Jeannine and Joanna. I wish I hadn't been to that party where I was called a shrew for saying no. In a society where a white man serves less time in prison for a rape conviction than a black man does for possession of half an ounce of an intoxicant while the woman in the assault is blamed for “inviting it,” something is still royally fucked up, and those who don’t see it are deceiving themselves. Her secret guilt was this:She was Cunt.She had “lost” something. Now the other party to the incident had manifested his essential nature, too; he was a Prick—but being Prick is not a bad thing. In fact, he had “gotten away with” something (possibly what she had “lost”). And there I was listening at eleven years of age: She was out late at night.She was in the wrong part of town. Her skirt was too short and that provoked him. She liked having her eye blacked and her head banged against the sidewalk.I understood this perfectly. (I reflected thus in my dream, in my state of being a pair of eyes in a small wooden box stuck forever on a gray, geometric plane—or so I thought.) I too had been guilty of what had been done to me, when I came home from the playground in tears because I had been beaten up by bigger children who were bullies. I was dirty.I was crying.I demanded comfort. I was being inconvenient. I did not disappear into thin air.I don't think this is just a story that speaks of the frustration of women, though. I think this is the struggle of the Other in all forms. I see this frustration in my gay friends trying to become recognized as a married couple (as people at all) in a state that has now legally endorsed segregation and discrimination on the grounds that they’re “offensive” to certain parties. I see it in my minority friends, especially those of mixed races, who try to function not as their race, but as individuals. It's the struggle of the Other, not in the 1970s, but EVERY SINGLE DAY. If we are all Mankind, it follows to my interested and righteous and rightnow very bright and beady little eyes, that I too am a Man and not at all a Woman, for honestly now, whoever heard of Java Woman and existential Woman and the values of Western Woman and scientific Woman and alienated nineteenth-century Woman and all the rest of that dingy antiquated rag-bag?"" All the rags in it are White, anyway.The J's (as they're known later in the book) are each incarnations of the aspects of the Other who tries to remain functional in a society built against her. Some of them are incarnations of wishful thinking--the women or the self we want to be (though Russ shows the flaws in those ""idealized"" selves, too, much more than Gilman does in Herland), and the others are compartmentalized into the societies of the present or the past, but they make a compatible whole. They are the Same. They are still, for all their flaws and angst, us. The sooner we see the alientation we still allow, the sooner we can actually have the liberty we claim already exists.How am I to put this together with my human life, my intellectual life, my solitude, my transcendence, my brains, and my fearful, fearful ambition? I failed and thought it was my own fault. You can't unite woman and human any more than you can unite matter and anti-matter; they are designed not to be stable together and they make just as big an explosion inside the head of the unfortunate girl who believes in both.Russ speaks, in this book, to a demon that still feasts in society. We’re not post-feminist. We’re not all evolved past this shit, and I think she’d still say that today. We’re deceiving ourselves into thinking that we’ve evolved when we’re still clubbing each other about the heads in order to feel morally, intellectually, socially superior. Evolution’s still going retrograde, and Joanna saw it in 1975. As my mother once said: The boys throw stones at the frogs in jest. But the frogs die in earnest.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/908311.The_Female_Man
The Dosadi Experiment;Frank Herbert;1977;1970;320;3.83;7790;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Space Opera'];Beyond the God WallGenerations of a tormented human-alien people, caged on a toxic planet, conditioned by constant hunger and war-this is the Dosadi Experiment, and it has succeeded too well. For the Dosadi have bred for Vengeance as well as cunning, and they have learned how to pass through the shimmering God Wall to exact their dreadful revenge on the Universe that created them . . .;Frank Herbert’s Dune was a masterpiece, not just of the genre but of literature, it was and remains an amazing achievement. The second Dune book was good, the third pretty good, and the fourth OK, and so on. Fans of all the Dune books (and I am one) worshipped the original (correctly and justly) and simply enjoy reveling in the world building. And so I come to Frank Herbert’s 1977 novel The Dosadi Experiment. I read a review I liked and recalled the quality of his writing that I had enjoyed so much and thought it time to give him another try, this time away from Arrakis. The idea, that of a social and biological experiment conducted on an epic, planetary scale, is similar in tone, if not style, to Philip K. Dick’s The World Jones Made. But where PKD’s novel is thematically surreal and emblazoned with his signature otherworldliness, Herbert’s novel is darker, more brooding. Herbert sets the stage for a fascinating legal drama , albeit a weird, baffling, alien but nonetheless hypnotic drama. Herbert’s use of mysterious alien legal and cultural frameworks would make Alfred Bester scratch his head, but he somehow pulls it off. Dosadi is much akin to Arrakis, a small world where a spartan, violently simplistic society breeds a possible change agent that may affect everything else.Finally, this makes me think that, along with the Dune novels, that Herbert belongs in the ranks of Dick, LeGuin, and Bradbury and the “soft science fiction” side of the house because unlike hard science fiction Heinlein, Asimov, and Clark, Herbert’s story lines revolve around legal, political. economic and cultural elements and often involve a future so far forward that the plot is purely fantastic.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2011.The_Dosadi_Experiment

Titan, an independent republic, was originally colonized from Earth three generations earlier. Duncan's initial challenge is to prepare, physically and intellectually, for the 500-million-mile trip to Earth. Once there, he is caught up in a sweep of new experiences, including the social and political whirl in Washington, a strange visit to a carefully preserved ancient city once prominent in the 20th century, and a search for and meeting with a woman he loved since she visited Titan years before.;Imperial Earth, Arthur C.

A World Out of Time;Larry Niven;1976;1970;246;3.8;6501;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera'];Jaybee Corbell awoke after more than 200 years as a corpsicle -- in someone else's body, and under sentence of instant annihilation if he made a wrong move while they were training him for a one-way mission to the stars.But Corbell picked his time and made his own move. Once he was outbound, where the Society that ruled Earth could not reach him, he headed his starship toward the galactic core, where the unimaginable energies of the Universe wrenched the fabric of time and space and promised final escape from his captors.Then he returned to an Earth eons older than the one he'd left...a planet that had had 3,000,000 years to develop perils he had never dreamed of -- perils that became nightmares that he had to escape...somehow!;Who starts their novel with a trip to the center of the universe? That’s how you end a novel! Well, not Niven, he starts out this novel with complex, incredible, hard sci-fi ideas (at least at the time), and then follows it up with a whole another series of imaginative and complex concepts including solar system engineering, artificial intelligence, terraforming, and immortality to name a few. It’s the hard sci-fi ideas that kept me turning pages, unfortunately not the plot or characters. 	Niven wrote this novel in the mid-1970’s, which started in pieces and parts as a short story and a serial in ‘Galaxy’ magazine. He combined and published these as a novel in 1976. The book finished seventh in the novel category of the 1977 Locus awards. He went on to write two more sequels which are titled “The Integral Trees” and “The Smoke Ring.” 	To me, the book felt like a collection of separate components, rather than a single cohesive story. There are enough ‘big ideas’ to support several novels, but unfortunately, while the book exceeds in ideas, it underperforms in character development and engaging prose. It might be a stretch, but I saw inspiration from H.G. Well’s “The Time Machine” and even J.M. Barrie’s “Peter Pan.” 	The book starts strong with our protagonist, Jaybee Corbell waking from a cryogenic sleep only to find he is basically a slave to ‘The State.’ (Now I know where Dennis E. Taylor got his inspiration for “We Are Legion (We Are Bob).”) The State has awaked Corbell to become a starship pilot and embark on a mission to several distant star systems and seed worlds for future terraforming. Well, Corbell has other ideas and heads for the galactic center. Eventually, Corbell returns to Earth, only to find a reorganized solar system and a barely recognizable planet, due to the passing of millions of years from space travel time dilation. From here on, we follow Corbell as he journeys though a wonderous, yet hostile environment. There were also a few extremely ‘cringy’ sex scenes (an orgy and one that borders on violence), despite multiple descriptions of Corbell’s low sex drive. I could have done without those. Anywho, I enjoyed the future worldbuilding and the slowly revealed history of Earth and its inhabitants, but the storytelling itself was lacking.	A 1970’s hard sci-fi novel which, while starting strong and filled with big intriguing hard sci-fi ideas, eventually falls short on character building and storytelling.

When Daniel Eakins inherits a time machine, he soon realizes that he has enormous power to shape the course of history. He can foil terrorists, prevent assassinations, or just make some fast money at the racetrack. And if he doesn't like the results of the change, he can simply go back in time and talk himself out of making it! But Dan soon finds that there are limits to his powers and forces beyond his control.My Review: Danny's been livin' the high life, thanks to a bequest from his mysterious old uncle. One day, the gravy train ends, and Danny has to make his own way. With a belt. A very special time-travel-enabling belt.An exploration of adolescent exceptionalism, a meditation on the establishment, building, and defense of identity, and an astonishingly rare representation of gay maleness in science fiction. The author, who penned ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" for the original Star Trek series, tackles all this heaviness in less than 200pp, and never makes it feel like any tackling is being done. Deft and timely even now, Gerrold's unapologetically gay Danny is mildly surprising even in the modern SFnal world. The ewww-ick-they-do-WHAT? homophobes need fear nothing, there's no raunch in Danny's journey of self-discovery (of a sort I've never seen again).For my teenaged self, this book blew into my life at a time when I was under emotional siege from the forces of Jesus. It was a lifeline thrown from a grown person to my too-young-to-run self. If he could write this book, there was a world that didn't loathe me, because here was something written, published, and sold with me in it! I endured many a screaming, hectoring, sermonizing hour thinking that thought.If you suspect some youth of your acquaintance might be struggling to think positively of himself because he's probably gay, think about giving him this book. It can't hurt, and it might do him a world of good.ETA a few musings and a quote. In going back over the 2003 edition of this book, I thought to compare it to the 1973 edition that blew my mind wide open when first read (I was not going to sleep a peaceful night until I found a room full of men having sex with each other and diving in). Gerrold has done a light but thoroughgoing job of making alterations to the book that reflect thirty years' growth in himself and the world. It was lovely to see, and BenBella Books deserves our thanks for making room in this timeline for it to happen.I've pushed my rating to five stars because, thinking back on it, any minor quibbles I've made vanish in the arc-light of this novel's originality in a musty, stuffy, conservative genre. And world.I've said in other reviews (see Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand) that re-reads of the peak experiences of bygone days are hazardous to one's ego. I've always praised this book as a well-written, risk-taking, genre-expanding chef d'oeuvre by a writer whose fame came early. I was right then, I'm right now...this book's genre-bending continues because, despite the presence of many other QUILTBAG characters in current SF/F, the main character of this book remains unique and speaks with an evergreen honesty. The frame has been dusted and re-gilded to keep the portrait sharply focused. It takes nothing away from the central and beautiful idea of the book, the inner life of an infinity of people contained in one-many-same-different body-brain-spirit.I worked and worked to make that sentence make sense and I think I was only marginally successful, but I don't know how to make it better. If I figure it out, I will change it.^^^That there's a better review of this book than any I could have dreamed up before.And that quote:My body has not experienced its years in sequence. But it has experienced years. And it has aged. And my mind has been carried headlong with it—this lump of flesh travels through time its own way, in a way that no man has the power to change. ... Perhaps I'm not a mind at all. Perhaps I'm only a body pretending the vanity of being something more. Perhaps it's only the fact that language, which allows me to manipulate symbols, ideas, and concepts, also proves the awareness of self that precedes the inevitable analysis. ... I have spent a lifetime analyzing my life. Living it. And rewriting it to suit me.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/624122.The_Man_Who_Folded_Himself

My head hurts.Someone please stuff lettuce in Mitch's mouth and turn him on his shell.01/06/21Sadly, it’s time for an update. In this book, Gilead took control of the United States government via a violent coup in which they kill all the members of congress at the capitol. Then martial law was enacted. Carry on.5/22/19Looking back on my original review, it reads as quaint compared to the draconian state laws recently being passed, my state of Ohio being one of them. Make no mistake, this not about ‘life’ it’s about controlling women. If you can’t decide what happens to your own body you do not have freedom. This is about bodily autonomy. Women have the RIGHT to legal and safe abortions with no qualifications. The fact that the narrative has gone to ‘in cases of rape and incest’ is troubling. Rape...incest...life of the mother....horrible birth defects....you’re young, single and not ready....you have five kids and can’t afford more, it doesn’t matter! This is a medical procedure and pregnancy is a risky condition, it can cause death. Every woman has the right to decide whether or not they want to take that risk. Period.Men don’t have anything that compares to this. No law is forcing them have vasectomies, or even denying them their bonner pills.7/7/17 I'm just going to leave this here.... fuck Paul Ryan.... but not literally, ew. Sleeveless women? My stars and garters!03/31/17. So, this Russia thing.... Am I right?2/5/17.....just another giant step towards making this book a reality, like they always dreamed of.Original review written in 2o12:WARNING: This review is being written after I worked a 13 hour day, with another one on the horizon tomorrow, and a glass of wine and while watching the Rachel Maddow show. Current events have put this book on the forefront of my mind, and damn it I got to get this out. I have never written a review on The Handmaid's Tale because I love the book, and it is so hard to write about a book you love. Ehh, what the hell.OfFred was a normal everyday woman with a career, a name, a life like all women have come to expect and take for granted in this age. When the Religious Right came into power, they began to put into practice their insane beliefs which strip women of their identity, their rights, their body, their very name. Women are to be called Of(whatever asshat they belong to), instead of, say Beatrix. Reproduction is an issue because all the toxins in the environment have rendered many women infertile. But if you are fertile, woe to you, you get to be a baby factory against your will, get promised to some jerk you don’t love or even like because someone deemed him important enough to breed. Oh, come on!This book was written in 1986, FYI. I thought it was scary and sort of possible when I first read it, but farfetched. This could NEVER happen in the United States of America. Never would it be allowed to happen here, we are too educated.So………I turn on the news (in twothousandandfrikntwelve) and certain religious factions on the right are trying to defund Planned Parenthood, because they perform abortions which is only 3% of what they do (with NO federal $ going towards them). Mostly PP provides healthcare to women who wouldn't get it otherwise………..icky poor women. Now it’s birth control? Seriously? Birth control??????? Did I wake up in 1950? Am I stuck in a Atwood novel? 98% of Catholic women (technically I’m one of them) use/used birth control. Even they are asking WTF? I’m not sure what these people are trying to do. There are more women than men and we vote……unless that’s the next right on the chopping block.------------------------------------------------------------There have several updates to this review that I have removed to make room for the next. what follows is the most recent one. ------------------------------------------------------------It’s been nearly a week since the unimaginable happened and I had to let the shock wear off before I could put a coherent, non-rage filled update on this review. Not that I don’t have rage, I have plenty to spare, but I think it’s now at a level that is manageable enough for me not to just type out a string of obscenities. That being said… Update 11/14/16: An unqualified, racist, xenophobic, sexist, pathological liar, psychopathic reality star was elected to be the 45th president of the United States and the leader of the free world. FUCK!The United States has officially shat the bed. Few foresaw it, but in hindsight, it was coming down the road for a very long time. The United (divided) States voted for Hillary Clinton on whole (popular vote) by over 2,000,000 votes and counting (millions are still out in California, for example), yet Donald Trump is our president elect (gag) due to an antiquated electoral college system (which I could explain, but I’m not because Google can do that better than I can.) Now, I’m all for ditching the electoral college, unless the electors decide to do what it was intended to do under this circumstance; to save us from ourselves. See, our founding fathers knew that we would fall for some con artist, demagogue at some point in the future, so they wisely created the electoral college, a group of actual human beings trusted upon to stop such a calamity. I implore the folks of current electoral college recognize this election as a collective loss of sanity of less than a quarter of the population of this nation, and on December 19th put their votes towards the popular vote winner, Hillary Clinton. I realize that this is unlikely, but one can dream.How did this happen? There are many factors involved. Lots of opportunity for pointing fingers and fighting amongst ourselves, which I will admit to being a party to…..guilty. But, in my opinion, what it boils down to is these four things: Division, misinformation, apathy and fear of the ‘other’. Division: We are all in our own comfortable bubbles, digesting the information we are most comfortable with. For example, I never believed there was this much hate it this country because I didn't want to look at it; I knew it was there of course, but not at the level that it appears to be. Everyone wants to live where they feel they belong. Amongst those that are like minded and reaffirm your very rightness. Liberals don’t want to live in Indiana (or Ohio….sigh) any more than a conservative want’s to live in Washington state. We even do this in our social media as well (guilty again). This is what messed us up with the electoral college. Misinformation: I am not going to tell you who’s right or wrong here, I’ll let this study speak for itself.Apathy: Half…HALF… the country didn’t vote. You guys suck.Fear of the other: This country harbors more racism than I can comprehend. The white people in this country seemed a little angry about the black man in the white house and the white men were staunchly determined not to have a woman (white or not) follow him. I don’t mean all white men, just too many of them (chill.) “The advantage for Trump among men is larger than the 7-point advantage Romney had in 2012 and much different than in 2008, when men preferred Obama over McCain by a single point.”-PewResearchCenter. But then there are the white women, 53% went for Trump…..oh my sisters, I have no words.Which brings me to the reason why this update is relevant to this review and to this book (for those who tell me that my opinion is unwarranted....again.) Is the United States a more racist country, or a more sexist country? America has spoken, at least the ones who cared to speak, and the answer is “a goodly amount of both”, but in this election sexism won and women lost.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale
Ender’s Game;Orson Scott Card;1985;1980;324;4.31;1398806;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia'];"Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.";"DNF at 52%Dear Orson Scott Card,There are over 3,310,480,700 women in this world.Sincerely, Women. Dear Fans of This Book Who Are Probably About To Make An Angry Comment On This Review:Please leave now if you don't want to get all huffy and insulted and make a comment defending the author or whatever other shit that is this book. Or, if you want, go ahead. If you're going to comment, at least read the whole review and not just a quarter of it. I'm so sick of repeating myself over and over in the comments. Yes, I bash the author first, but I do make my points on why I hated the book itself, and not just because of him.Thank you. Sincerely, Kat. First of all, before I get into the book, I'd like to say that Orson Scott Card is one of the biggest dicks on this Earth. For those of who don't know, he is openly homophobic and a hyprocrite (www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_... )). He is a Chauvinist (known to believe that women are the weaker sex and were only put on this world to make babies). He is a Mormon that, from what I've heard from people who've read his other books, tries to convert you in his own writing in his novels. Just for this author's personality, this book deserves one star. But now onto the actual book, which deserves one star in itself.The Author's Viewpoints Leak InIt starts out well enough. It's interesting and keeps your attention. But immediately, the sexism shows its ugly face;""All the boys are organized into armies.""""All boys?""""A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them.""Keep in mind that this book is supposed to take place in the future. There are several things wrong with this sentence. 1. In this day and age, thousands of women are in the military and fighting for their country. They have been for decades now, and longer still. So if this is supposed to be in the future, does Card think that women will give up their ability to fight so easily?  2. Centuries of evolution working against them? On what terms? That we have ovaries? That we can have babies so are therefore unfit to fight or have the mental capacity to pass the tests boys can easily pass? This is the 21st century, genius. Women work. Women are in the army. Get your head out of your ass and look around, for fuck's sakes. CharactersI feel that Card made all the characters far too young. Ender is six, Valentine is eight, and Peter is ten. Peter has a fetish for torturing squirrels and threatening to kill his siblings. Um, okay? Is there any explanation for this strange behavior? No, because according to this book, all our kids in the future are fully functioning psychopaths. (Except the girls, of course. They're too 'mild' for behavior like that.)In the future, the army is apparently full of kids barely older than six, up to age twelve. To be trained for a war that, as far as I could tell from the point I got to, was already won. WritingThe writing was atrocious. Card switches from third person perspective to first person constantly. The first person switches are for the character's 'thoughts', but the words aren't italicized or anything so you can never tell. To me, that's a sign of bad writing. If you can't stick with one kind of perspective, than you should go back to those non-existent creative writing classes. Plot Towards the middle of the book, the plot started to seriously drag and get outright ridiculous. Valentine and Peter start planning to 'take over the world' by writing fucking debate columns. Not only is the whole 'let's rule the world' concept highly overused, it's poorly planned out. It's randomly thrown into the story like, ""Okay, we need more villains and more things happening, so let's make the ten year old girl and twelve year old murderous boy try to take over the world!......with debate columns."" Sure. Then, switching back to Ender, who is now nine years old and a commander of his own kid army, we have our main character turning into the bullying idiots that bullied him in the beginning of the book. Has he learned nothing? Oh sure, it makes the kids 'better soldiers'. They're not even seven years old, they are not fucking soldiers. The whole story is a fucked up version of a 'kid military' which is run by controlling adults who don't want the war to end so they can remain in power. It--just--ugh. It got so tedious and irritating that I decided to give up on it. I'm not going to waste my time with a book written by a sexist, homophobic, dickwad. I'm not even going to see the movie, which is a real shame because I love Asa Butterfield. I feel bad that he was brought into such a stupid book/movie business.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game
Neuromancer;William Gibson;1984;1980;268;3.89;335340;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy'];Hotwired to the leading edges of art and technology, Neuromancer is a cyberpunk, science fiction masterpiece—a classic that ranks with 1984 and Brave New World as one of the twentieth century’s most potent visions of the future.The Matrix is a world within the world, a global consensus-hallucination, the representation of every byte of data in cyberspace...Henry Dorsett Case was the sharpest data-thief in the business, until vengeful former employees crippled his nervous system. But now a new and very mysterious employer recruits him for a last-chance run. The target: an unthinkably powerful artificial intelligence orbiting Earth in service of the sinister Tessier-Ashpool business clan. With a dead man riding shotgun and Molly, mirror-eyed street-samurai, to watch his back, Case embarks on an adventure that ups the ante on an entire genre of fiction.The winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K. Dick Awards, Neuromancer was the first fully-realized glimpse of humankind’s digital future—a shocking vision that has challenged our assumptions about our technology and ourselves, reinvented the way we speak and think, and forever altered the landscape of our imaginations.;Wow. This is a wild ride. If you like Philip K. Dick’s writing and wondered what would happen if you extended his vision into the not too distant future, if you liked Bladerunner, if you liked The Matrix … and even if you like all the film and fiction that has made an attempt to be any of the above, you will love Neuromancer.William Gibson said that while writing Neuromancer he went to see the Ridley Scott film Bladerunner and thought that his ideas for the book were hopelessly lost, that everyone would naturally assume that he had taken all of his queues from the film. I have written that Bladerunner was that most rare of accomplishments, a film that was as good or better than the book. Bladerunner was of course patterned loosely after Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Phillip K. Dick. One reason why Bladerunner was as good was because Scott’s vision was so different from Dick’s. Bladerunner was a distinctly cyberpunk vision, whereas Dick’s was dystopian but not necessarily cyberpunk.Neuromancer has been called the definitive, benchmark novel of the cyberpunk sub-genre. Gibson takes his influences from Escape from New York, Anthony Burgess and from Phillip K. Dick, among others, but then goes to a wholly different level. It can even be said that Gibson, who in turn heavily influenced the producers of The Matrix, is a bridge between the older 60s post-modernist dystopian science fiction with the more modern, computer driven, angst ridden world weariness that has represented artists since the 80s. Neuromancer defined the genre and I could hardly go a few pages without noticing how it had influenced literature and film since.As a book, this was excellent, I could not put it down. Gibson creates an edge, a tension that exists throughout the narrative that grabs the reader and won’t let him go. Gibson is the literary successor to Phillip K. Dick, an observer who does not skip ahead to a distant dystopian rebirth, but instead chronicles the ugly fall itself.******* 2018 re-readAs I type these words here in June of 2018, Goodreads says that I have rated over 1400 books and have reviewed over 1300. Of these I have listed six as being my all-time favorites. After thinking about Neuromancer for years and having just re-read it, almost literally not putting it down, I am adding this to my very short list of beloved books.The PKD allusions are still there as is the Bosch-esque attention to detail – this is a kaleidoscope of sights and sounds and ideas coming at you at ludicrous speed. There are also the references to Bladerunner and Escape from New York and this makes me think of the shared consciousness and Jungian gestalt cultural observations that Gibson was tapping into in the early eighties. What was going on in this time that made such talented artists as Ridley Scott and John Carpenter also envision such a world?What caught my eye this time around was the noir elements to the story and Gibson’s writing, heavy but fast moving as it is, tunes into a retro style that you can almost hear Harrison Ford’s Deckard narrating as Case gets to the bottom of the twin AI mystery.At it’s heart, this is of course THE cyberpunk novel, honorable mention to Neal Stephenson’s 1992 Snow Crash. Gibson was jacked into a time and space phenomena that was just below the subconscious and so struck a chord with so many. But it is also a timeless speculative fiction novel in the sense that it depicts human isolation and technological alienation that Yevgeny Zamyatin and E.M. Forster wrote about decades before. Necromancer’s influence on the Matrix films makes it the Godfather of post-modern techno-punk thrillers.A must read.*** 2022 reread – As before I was quickly taken in to Gibson’s world and carried through the story on his tightly packed prose and then dumped unceremoniously at the end, gasping for breath and again impressed with this unique literary experience that is Neuromancer.If this were music it would be a wall of sound, a cacophony of noise that at first seems chaotic and yet the listener is soon absorbed into the composition, identifying and distinguishing various melodies and themes within the complex score.I think I've wondered this before but will formally wonder now and here: was Gibson inspired by the writings of John Varley? There seems to be some similarities in style and theme and if so I like Varley even more.Case and Molly are archetypes now, the anti-hero and the tech femme fatale. Wintermute and Neuromancer are twin godfathers of the Matrix and all the stories that fall into that genre.Cannot believe that I let four years go by between readings and this may / should be an annual reread for me.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6088007-neuromancer
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe;Douglas Adams;1980;1980;250;4.2;296076;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Classics', 'Audiobook'];"alternate edition for ISBN 0345418921/9780345418920Facing annihilation at the hands of the warlike Vogons is a curious time to have a cosmically displaced Arthur Dent and his curious comrades in arms as they hurtle through space powered by pure improbability - and desperately in search of a place to eat.

Zaphod, Marvin, Trillian, Arthur and Ford resume their improbable adventures through the infinity of time and the immensity of a boundlessly crazy galaxy.

Many funny moments and absurd genialities of a tragically comic universe like only Douglas can deliver. Unfortunately, for various reasons, this sequel didn’t really cut it. Maybe the surprise was lost, maybe the humor didn’t nail it like the first time. Maybe the first book set a too high standard, impossible to reach.Zaphod, a character that I found hilariously unpredictable in the first installment, in this one I found extremely grumpy and frankly highly unpleasant to bear. Trillian scarcely appears to make any comment at all, and Arthur and Ford barely have an exiguous protagonism, nearing the very end. But above everything, way too much Zaphod.Thank god Marvin was there to ""brighten up"" the day though!-----------------------------------------------

Hyperion;Dan Simmons;1989;1980;500;4.27;262944;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Horror'];On the world called Hyperion, beyond the law of the Hegemony of Man, there waits the creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives. Each carries a desperate hope—and a terrible secret. And one may hold the fate of humanity in his hands.;Somehow I’ve managed to read a dozen books by Dan Simmons without getting around to Hyperion, one of his most acclaimed works. Frankly, I’ve been scared of it. Simmons has been mashing up horror, sci-fi, hard boiled crime novels, thrillers, and historical fiction while often stuffing his books with so many ideas that it was all I could do to keep up so this seemed like it could be a bit more than I could comfortably chew. Just as I feared, while I was reading and nearing the end, Simmons crept into my house like a ninja and rammed a funnel into my skull. Then he poured his wild sci-fi ideas and concepts into my brain pan like a frat boy pouring the suds in a beer bong. My mind overloaded, and I gibbered like a monkey on meth for fifteen seconds before passing out. When I woke up an hour later with a wicked headache and cerebrospinal fluid leaking out my ears and nose, Simmons was gone, but he’d left a note saying “Don’t you ever learn? Keep reading and one of these days, I will END you!”So now I’m typing this with cotton balls stuck in my nostrils and ears while I’m waiting to get my MRI scan, and I’m once again left in awe of just how many wildly original ideas Simmons can cram into one story. Simmons borrows the structure of The Canterbury Tales here. In the distant future, humanity has spread out among the stars, and one of the planets they’ve inhabited is Hyperion which has the mysterious Time Tombs and a deadly entity known as the Shrike which protects the area around them. A powerful religion has grown around the Shrike and many make pilgrimages to try and see him from which almost no one ever returns.A former Consul of Hyperion is contacted by the Hegemony government and told that he must join a pilgrimage to see the Shrike with six others. The Ousters, a faction of humanity mutated by centuries of living in deep space, has been making aggressive moves against Hegemony worlds and now they’re targeting Hyperion just as there are signs that the empty Time Tombs are about to stop moving backwards in time and finally reveal their secrets. The Consul meets the other pilgrims which include a priest, a soldier, a poet, a scholar, a detective and the captain of a rare giant tree capable of space travel. (Yes, a giant tree moving through space. Ask Simmons. I’m just reporting the news here, folks.) Realizing that they must have been chosen to make the journey for a reason, they take turns telling the stories of their connections to Hyperion and the Shrike as they make their way towards the Time Tombs.I struggled with this book at first because Simmons throws the readers into the deep end of the pool with little explanation of the universe he’s created, and I don’t do well with books that start like: “Captain Manly Squarejaw woke up on his Confederated star potato and drank a glass of strained purplepiss juice while checking his com unit thingie to get the lastest news on the crisis involving the Whogivesashitsus.“Fortunately, Simmons gets the plot up and moving quickly, and then uses the stories of each of the pilgrims to fill us in on the history and setting. By using the different story tellers, Simmons gives different perspectives for tales as diverse as an interstellar war to a future detective story with big sci-fi action to quieter personal tragedies like a father losing his daughter to a horrible fate. All of these stories eventually come back around to Hyperion and the Shrike. I was also impressed how Simmons writing this in 1989 foresaw a computer network linking people, but also turning them into information overloaded cyber junkies who confuse accumulating news with taking action. There’s so many different big sci-fi ideas in here that many writers probably would have been content to make an entire career out them, but Simmons uses them all deftly to create one unified story. Oh, and memo to George Lucas: the next time you want to make a sci-fi movie with interplanetary politics being a primary driver to your plot, read this first. Or just hire Simmons to write the damn thing for you .My only gripe is that while I knew there were sequels to this, I thought I was getting a complete story, and it definitely leaves a lot hanging for the next book. And there’s a Wizard of Oz thing near the end, and I hate the goddamn Wizard of Oz. It’s a Kansas thing.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion

A los ciudadanos de Krikkit no les gusta ver tantos puntos brillantes en su cielo a la noche, por lo cual planean corregirlo, borrando del mapa todos los planetas de la galaxia. Dent, Ford, Trillian y Zhapod, el disparatado cuarteto de la desgracia, simplemente tratarán de no empeorar las cosas.Una interesante nueva entrega. Arthur y Ford vuelven a la escena principal, Trillian con un leve protagonismo casi al final, y, gracias a Dios, mucho menos Zhapod. La pluma de Adams tan magníficamente satírica como siempre, lejos de esa perfección del #1, pero mucho mejor que #2. Una secuela ciertamente entretenida, muy graciosa a veces, y con algunos momentos para el recuerdo. Simplemente amé la introducción de Wowbagger. Marvin era mi personaje preferido, pero el trono ahora le pertenece a Wowbagger, un personaje altamente controversial, pero con un propósito admirable.-----------------------------------------------

Charlie McGee inherited pyrokinetic powers from her parents, who had been given a low-grade hallucinogen called ""Lot Six"" while at college. Now the government is trying to capture young Charlie and harness her powerful firestarting skills as a weapon.--stephenking.com";Ooh, I'm glad I checked this one off my Stephen King reading list. Firestarter is a great companion to another King book I enjoyed--The Institute-- even though the books were published close to forty years apart. Basically: poor little kids with special powers get chased down by a corrupt government organization. Firestarter is propulsive, even with King's standard hundred or so pages of superfluous detail. We land smack bang in the middle of the action with Charlie McGee and her father Andy on the run from some shady figures. I felt the fear and desperation pretty much immediately, and that tugged me right into the story. And it just gets wilder from there.The characters are good, but I feel like King doesn't write very good child characters in his older books. Or maybe he doesn't write very good girl characters period. Trish's thoughts in The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon did not resemble those of a nine year old girl, and here Charlie did not make much of an impression on me. Andy, Rainbird, Cap and even the Manders were more interesting to me. So it's good that we got to visit all their perspectives.Betrayals, secret messages and shitty people abound! And it all culminates in an explosive climax... pun intended.Not a particularly scary King book-- unless being chased by government agents is a fear of yours --but definitely a fun one.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233667.Firestarter
Sphere;Michael Crichton;1987;1980;371;3.83;188749;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Suspense'];A psychological thriller about a group of scientists who investigate a spaceship discovered on the ocean floor. In the middle of the South Pacific, a thousand feet below the surface, a huge vessel is unearthed. Rushed to the scene is a team of American scientists who descend together into the depths to investigate the astonishing discovery. What they find defies their imaginations and mocks their attempts at logical explanation. It is a spaceship, but apparently it is undamaged by its fall from the sky. And, most startling, it appears to be at least three hundred years old, containing a terrifying and destructive force that must be controlled at all costs.;Very much yada yada, humanities vs natural sciences and a wasted plot idea with far too less action and twists.I still remember how boredom and disappointment grew, after the first few chapters showed the setting and some suspense was built up and then it got lengthy and neither the psychological inner character plot nor the other big mystery plot made much fun or sense, especially because the logic of motivations and thinking capacities and abilities of the protagonists were… average.Some seem to see some kind of deeper philosophical meaning in this one, especially towards the end with something one could call a subtle plot twist, but to me, it was a too constructed, not well designed novel. It tried to be mindfu**ing, but the realization was poor.Possibly, in its time, when there were not much of similar techno- and science-thriller works with Sci-Fi elements for a broader audience, it could have been seen as not so bad because of a lack of alternatives, but especially compared with what today's genre writers produce on a yearly basis and very high level, it sucks. I especially have to laugh about the „psychological thriller“ argument that was used to sell it, because Crichton's characterization and dialogues are so terrible in this one.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455373.Sphere

But a gift-wrapped fishbowl with a cryptic inscription, the mysterious disappearance of Earth's dolphins, and the discovery of his battered copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy all conspire to give Arthur the sneaking suspicion that something otherworldly is indeed going on. . . .God only knows what it all means. And fortunately, He left behind a Final Message of explanation. But since it's light-years away from Earth, on a star surrounded by souvenir booths, finding out what it is will mean hitching a ride to the far reaches of space aboard a UFO with a giant robot. But what else is new?;"Yo Fenchurch!  After so many crazy adventures through the galaxy, Arthur Dent is back on a reconstructed Earth. Life, for once, seems happily uneventful, until the arrival of a mysterious character, and the appearance of a fishbowl with a cryptic message; not to mention, the disappearance of every single dolphin in the world.This was the second best installment in the series. I absolutely LOVED the introduction of Fenchurch. Learned to understand and care about her so much more in just one book, than with Trillian in three. Just loved her character development and her unfolding relationship with Dent. The biscuits story is one of the most hilarious things I’ve ever read in my entire life, and my most precious memory of all the books in the series. Cracks me up to tears every time I read it. This was mostly a solid 3 star read, but Fenchurch and the biscuits scene deserving an extra star.For me this is the end of the series. #5 is something I like to pretend never happened. To anyone reading this, I'm going to tell you something I wish someone had told me before going forward. STOP HERE, don't read #5, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. #4 is a nice HEA ending for the series, #5 REALLY is not.

Mi sono piaciuti tutti e mi rendo conto che Crichton mi manca, se ne è andato troppo presto. E mi rendo anche conto che ho ancora tanto da leggere di suo, ha scritto e fatto molto nei suoi brevi sessantasei anni.Come si fa a dimenticare che dalla sua penna nasce Westworld – Il mondo dei robot che lui ha anche diretto al cinema con quel magnifico robot pistolero del west interpretato da Yul Brinner che metteva i brividi! E come si fa a dimenticare quell’altra sua regia, 1855: La più grande rapina al treno, con l’adorato Sean Connery (e Donald Sutherland)! E almeno un altro paio di film diretti personalmente da non dimenticare Coma – Coma profondo e Runaway (ma furono di più, una mezza dozzina di titoli, senza escludere che è tra i creatori della serie E.R., che da sola vale un inchino particolarmente sentito).Michael Crichton [Chicago 23 ottobre 1942 – Los Angeles 4 novembre 2008] era alto 2 metri e 6 centimetri.Congo è stato l’ultimo che ho letto e probabilmente quello che ho amato di più: perché mi piace l’Africa, e perché ho un debole per i gorilla (più dei dinosauri: ma i dinosauri sarebbero così popolari oggigiorno se non fosse proprio per lui e il suo Parco Giurassico?).Creativamente prolifico e dinamico (romanzi, racconti, saggi, sceneggiature, regie, serie tv, produttore), con studi scientifici alle spalle (soprattutto medicina, ma non solo), questo Jules Verne del XX secolo è autore di pagine che parlano di viaggi straordinari, e per quello che mi riguarda – intendo, considerate le mie cognizioni sull’argomento – potrebbe avere inventato un nuovo genere, che non è né fantascienza né la sua variante distopica: il tecno-thriller. Scienza, avventura, azione, suspense, shakerate e miscelate, senza vodka né gin né oliva (mi spiace, James – ma, a prescindere da Bond, il Martini è stato il primo cocktail di cui mi sono innamorato, probabilmente perché Graham Greene ne era strenuo difensore, e bevitore, nella variante strictly gin).AmyQui (pubblicato nel 1979) c’è una spedizione nel cuore del Continente Nero, nel Congo del titolo, il cuore dell’Africa: deve impadronirsi di certi diamanti speciali necessari per fabbricare le armi indispensabili alla prossima Terza Guerra Mondiale. Si portano dietro strumenti tecnologici sofisticati e all’avanguardia. Dovranno vedersela con una guerra civile, con la competizione di un consorzio concorrente euro-giapponese, con l’eruzione di un vulcano.

And no one who encounters them will ever be the same again:A lonely widower; a ruthless assassin; a beautiful woman; a government agent.Drawn together in a deadly hunt, all four are inexorably propelled towards a confrontation with an evil beyond human imagining.";"I haven't read Dean Koontz in years. I don't think I've missed much after reading this one though. BUT some of my other buddy readers think differently. They are wrong.Dean Koontz can't even wash his panties in the same room with Stephen King.

Now that I've put that image in your head, I'll ramble some about the book. You have this lab who had been creating super smart critters to fight. They never really tell how so don't be getting your sciency on for this one. There is a hit man who is offing the scientist so that might be why Koontz doesn't tell us. Who knows?

 I wanted at least a pretense of explanation. The lab has 'sired' a super smart dog and that other thing. The Outsider. Then enter the guy character. He was sorta alright but not a character that would stick out in my head. For ex-Delta force I really expected a whole lot more bad-ass than he was. Enter in Nora, she has lived her whole sheltered life in her mean old aunt's shadow. She has had really no contact with the outside world and is introverted as all get out. For about five minutes, because once she meets the guy she is the most beautiful woman ever and everyone wants to bang her. 

All these characters are pretty annoying. The only ones I liked? The Outsider and the Dog, Einstein. I do think Einstein should have been a chihuahua though. 

Chihuahuas rock. I have three and then I have the boy child's dog. (That's a whole nuther story on that one though.) But chihuahuas would have gotten this book an extra star from me. Because see how smart they are? (Blatant promotion of my own dogs coming here)Faking sleep when tries to be made to go outside and pee in the rain: Smart!

Being Spider-Dog to try and jump in mom's plate of food: Smart!

Interupting mom's selfie taking to crawl on her shoulder wanting in the pic? Not really smart but you can't win them all.

Then the Outsider. 

I wish he had ate perfect Nora and the guy and went on to make sciency babies with the dog, while they watched Mickey Mouse videos. Total win that would have been!

I read this as a buddy read with Delee, Stepheny, 2.0, Ed and Kelly.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32423.Watchers

See: Original Record HereLate Last Night and the Night Before ...... Tommyknockers, tommyknockers, knocking at the door.Something was happening in Bobbi Anderson's idyllic small town of Haven, Maine. Something that gave every man, woman, and child in town powers far beyond ordinary mortals. Something that turned the town into a death trap for all outsiders. Something that came from a metal object, buried for millennia, that Bobbi accidentally stumbled across. It wasn't that Bobbi and the other good folks of Haven had sold their souls to reap the rewards of the most deadly evil this side of hell. It was more like a diabolical takeover...an invasion of body and soul--and mind....Note: All information herein, such as number of pages, publisher, etc., refer to this alternate cover edition and may or may not coincide with the main entry for this ISBN or any other alternate covers.~";"Okay, okay, I know what some of you may be thinking. This isn't a perfect book, how could I give it five stars?The truth is, I'm not a critical reader; a book doesn't need to be technically perfect in order for me to love it.I rate books based upon my reading experience and I absolutely loved my time rereading The Tommyknockers.This SciFi-Horror novel, first published in 1987, is set in the small town of Haven, Maine.One day while walking in the woods of her rather large property, local woman, Bobbi Anderson, quite literally stumbles upon a mysterious metal object protruding from the ground.Unable to understand what she is seeing, Bobbi quickly becomes obsessed with freeing it.The longer she's around the object however, the more she notices disturbing side effects suffered by both herself, and her old dog, Peter.Regardless, Bobbi continues to feel the pull of the object in the woods.Around the same time Bobbi has developed this new obsession, her old friend, Jim Gardener, known as Gard, finds himself in the depths of a true alcoholic bender.On a morning where he is moments from ending it all, Gard experiences an overwhelming feeling that Bobbi, his one true friend, is in real danger; he needs to call her.Unable to get through on the phone, he does what anyone would do. He hitchhikes to her house.Once there, Gard finds Bobbi in a state of, shall we say, disrepair.Bobbi gives Gard a run-down of all she has been up to; including showing him the mysterious object.She enlists his help in her mission to free it. Although he has his reservations, Gard loves Bobbi and ultimately decides to stick around and help her out.From there, we meet the town of Haven. Though they don't know why, the other locals have begun to feel the effects of the object's greater exposure.The fallout seems to be effecting the health and wellness of the entire town. Incidentally, it also has a significant effect on anyone passing through.Written towards the end of the Cold War, at a time when discussions of nuclear weapons, power and nonproliferation evoked a lot of passion amongst people, that influence can be felt here.The fact that I am using the word, fallout, as an apt way to describe what was happening to the citizens of Haven, exemplifies that.In addition to the social commentary, which I feel King is genuinely good at weaving into his stories, he also incorporates various other elements he seems to enjoy exploring.There's author protagonists, both Bobbi and Gard are writers, alcoholism, mental telepathy, revivalist preachers, dolls, rats, bats, creepy kids and a fantastic array of body horror. It really has it all.Also, as usual, this story is full of witty humor and characters that are so well-developed you feel like you've known them your whole life.As a Maine native, I can tell you this story is full of Mainerism, as well!Overall, I had such a fun time sinking my teeth into this one again. I had forgotten so much.Additionally, I picked up many more connections to the greater Kingverse than the first time around; having an additional 20-years to read his stories.I think this one is underrated. Not just underrated, it gets a solidly bad rap. However, I humbly disagree. I think if you love King, and love SciFi, you can love this book as well.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17660.The_Tommyknockers

Who—or what—is out there? In Cosmos, Carl Sagan explained the universe. In Contact, he predicts its future—and our own.;Sagan was a visionary beyond time. He understood the beauty of the universe by the laws of physics and how everything converged for them. And how are human beings part of this vast scenario, perhaps the only ones for whom the cosmos exist? He continues with this idea in Contact, although this is a work of fiction, specifically science fiction. This work is science fiction of a different genre without laser beams, flying saucers, or little green men. Eleanor (Ellie) Arroway is a unique child who understood when she was three. Her mother is sympathetic to her, but her father, Ted, is the one who structures her personality. When he dies, a piece of Ellie seems to die with him. She focuses all her efforts on being a brilliant student and becoming a renowned physicist. So, it is surprising that she has started a relationship with Palmer Joss, a preacher of Christian renewal whose religious views are entirely different from Ellie's coherent world vision. That's when she discovers something that can shake the world. She had established contacts with aliens, and now the world needs to prepare for something unexpected. Ellie's journey out there, as well as her inner journey, begins here. She will travel through the stars and to the deepest recesses of her heart, memory, and existence. She must also understand God's hidden message in the universe's order.

It could have been an epic milestone like the ingenious hitchhiker series, but it is simply too short and too densely packed at the same time, it´s a miracle that this is even possible. Infodump makes one nervous toward the endThe characters and main plots could have been used for one much longer or two short books and it would have been a masterpiece again. More details in the descriptions, probably some more explanations to the reader or another side plot, infodumps, longer dialogues, it would all have been possible if Adams hadn´t tried to distill it to the absolute minimum. I got nervous the closer I got to the end because I couldn´t imagine how all those should culminate in a credible, understandable, and satisfying ending. Deus ex machinas instead of explanationsEspecially the end was really unsatisfying, so much came out of nothing, interesting ideas weren´t described in detail and everything felt quite half-baked with too many questions left unanswered and too much confusion for the reader. And I am someone who reads multi k page series with loads of settings, characters, and connections that can be understandably described by the author without a permanent ""what, where, when, why, how?"" like in this case.  And it goes puffAdams' intention has been to make as many and as complex subplots, connections, and associations as possible to let them explode in an epic culmination point, but it didn´t get speed and just hit the fourth wall a tiny little bit without producing more noise than contrived harrumph to let the embarrassing moment pass by. It feels as if there should have been a second half before the sudden ending. Amazingly still goodDon´t get me wrong, it´s still a good, philosophical book full of innuendos, connotations, and some good laughs, but don´t expect the same quality or the same entertainment as the more famous galactic fun (just the trilogy, not what follows) brought to your mind.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/365.Dirk_Gently_s_Holistic_Detective_Agency

Tracking one man's descent into the Kafkaesque underworld of contemporary Tokyo, Murakami unites East and West, tragedy and farce, compassion and detachment, slang and philosophy.;"This is your brain (an egg). This is your brain on Murakami (an egg sprouting arms and legs and attempting to hump other eggs while doing the Electric Slide and attempting to save the world to a killer soundtrack). If you like Murakami, you'll like it, although it doesn't blend the two twisted sides of Murakami's writing as well as a book like ""Norwegian Wood"" or ""Kafka on the Shore."" In each of those novels, the reader gets transitions within chapters, and his talents for myth-telling in both the mystical and mundane worlds is woven together like two different colored pieces of yarn, fraying and blending at the end. A depressed hippy juggles his daily life - student and record-store shop employee who occasionally trolls for women with his amoral college roommate - with his intensely personal life - a boy growing into a man, learning about love, heartbreak and death. A talking cat accompanies a small boy on his adventures, the boy eating a lot of diner food and not really doing much but hanging out at the library. These are the things you get with Murakami, but they usually coexist fairly nicely, driving toward a space where fantasy and reality decide to have a nice conversation.""Hard Boiled Wonderland And The End Of The World"" is aptly titled, because it really is two separate stories - the ""And"" is paramount - they are woven together, but more like two noodles can be woven together, but never quite mesh. Oddly, the formal structure of the book - one chapter in reality, one chapter in myth - lends itself to reading the two stories as each lending to the other, but one could almost (until the very end) read each one as independent of the other. Murakami's ""reality"" is far-flung and outlandish, but it obeys its own rules, and takes the reader for a nice tragic ride. The ""myth"" is much more prosaic and sedate, but is clearly too serene to be reality. Perhaps it is Murakami's commentary on life: truth is stranger than fiction, especially when the fiction is based on the truth is based on the fiction...The novel could be an ouroboros, but instead it is a little like the hospital symbol of a serpent wrapped about a knife. To understand this, read the book. I can't describe it any better than this. It gets a four, because it's frankly a little too self-reflexive for me - no main character should really ever say, ""Stuff like this only happens in novels,"" as far as I'm concerned - but it is a stylistic precursor to Murakami's most famous and best work (that I've read), ""Kafka on the Shore,"" so you get to see how Murakami's style evolves, a dualistic peek into the development of a dichotomous author.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10374.Hard_Boiled_Wonderland_and_the_End_of_the_World

God Emperor of Dune;Frank Herbert;1981;1980;587;3.88;122002;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera'];Book four in Frank Herbert's magnificent Dune Chronicles--one of the most significant sagas in the history of literary science fiction.Millennia have passed on Arrakis, and the once-desert planet is green with life. Leto Atreides, the son of the world's savior, the Emperor Paul Muad'Dib, is still alive but far from human. To preserve humanity's future, he sacrificed his own by merging with a sandworm, granting him near immortality as God Emperor of Dune for the past thirty-five hundred years.Leto's rule is not a benevolent one. His transformation has made not only his appearance but his morality inhuman. A rebellion, led by Siona, a member of the Atreides family, has risen to oppose the despot's rule. But Siona is unaware that Leto's vision of a Golden Path for humanity requires her to fulfill a destiny she never wanted--or could possibly conceive....Includes an introduction by Brian Herbert;I hated this book the first time I read it. Hated every person in it, did not understand why anyone acted the way they did. Now it's one of my top-ten comfort reads, and I see so much in Leto I want for myself. Dune was the perfect hero book, and then Herbert turned the trope of “boy becomes Messiah and saves the noble people” on its head with Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. In those two volumes, everything assumed and trusted became so much sand, and a son had to destroy his Messiah father’s legacy to save the universe from religious genocide and tyranny. We closed on the boy becoming yet another saviour and had only a vague, hopeful idea of what he intended to do next. Herbert could have left us there, many thought he would when he finished his Dune Trilogy. Instead, he published his most difficult and daring book yet. In Emperor, we discover that the boy’s plan to save humanity from tyranny is... to become the ultimate Tyrant, and Predator of humankind. Yeah, I’m with you. Just say “huh?” and get it over with. I can’t explain without giving plot away. Emperor is a masterpiece of philosophy, and the best book in the series, but I wouldn’t blame you if you stopped somewhere in the middle and stuffed it to the back of your shelf for ten years before you gave it another chance. Who am I to argue? I did.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44439415-god-emperor-of-dune
Consider Phlebas;Iain M. Banks;1987;1980;467;3.85;93246;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Space'];"The war raged across the galaxy. Billions had died, billions more were doomed. Moons, planets, the very stars themselves, faced destruction, cold-blooded, brutal, and worse, random. The Idirans fought for their Faith; the Culture for its moral right to exist. Principles were at stake. There could be no surrender.Within the cosmic conflict, an individual crusade. Deep within a fabled labyrinth on a barren world, a Planet of the Dead proscribed to mortals, lay a fugitive Mind. Both the Culture and the Idirans sought it. It was the fate of Horza, the Changer, and his motley crew of unpredictable mercenaries, human and machine, actually to find it, and with it their own destruction.";"Welcome to another edition of 'Notable Genre Author Fails to Impress Some Guy on the Internet', I'll be your host: some guy. Like so many highly-lauded authors featured here, Banks has been haunting my shelf for quite some time now. Countless are the times I have passed this book before bed, letting my eyes linger longingly on the spine, relishing the notion that I will actually read this book, some day. There have even been those occasions where I thumbed it down, peering at the cover, carefully comparing it to others, knowing that I must be the final arbiter of posterity--to choose one, eschewing all others to a cruel and unknown future.As always I was prepared to be impressed, or even blown-away, and to tell the truth, it started off with some promise. The prose is fairly solid, and that title, it's a doozy. Unfortunately, the title's suggestion of literary intertextuality soon wilted on the vine, so I dialed-back my expectation to 'amusing, rollicking adventure'. Now, I would be lying if I suggested that there wasn't some breed of rip-snorting adventure in here, but unfortunately, it's all smothered beneath the cold, damp pillow of Too Much Explanation.It is a lamentable condition which affects nearly four quarters of all science fiction authors, and in many cases, proves uncurable. I can understand the temptation: you create this big, crazy world, and you want to share all of it with the reader, all the time! But what sci fi authors make up for in enthusiasm, they lack in structure, plot, and character.We are given long asides about the world, the politics, the war, and the characters' thoughts--the onmiscient narrator going on excitedly about tangents and small points to the detriment of the plot. Truly, there is no insight too small to be explicitly stated; even things we already know, like the fact that taking in an enemy and keeping them around is dangerous, or that the decision whether or not to shoot someone has two outcomes, one with shooting, the other with somewhat less shooting.People have described this book as an 'intellectual Space Opera', but when I picture an intellectually engaging book, it's not one that tells me that kissing is nice, that people with guns are scary, or that losing loved ones is sad. It's like the 'adverb problem' many writers suffer from; in the sentence:""What did you say?"" John asked, questioningly.We have a redundant description (questioningly) that adds nothing to the story but needless length. A good writer doesn't tell the reader things they already know; and they certainly don't tell them the same things over and over. I found the repetition particularly inexplicable. On one page, we're told that the character won't die of thirst because he's floating on a freshwater ocean. We are told it again on the following page, from the same character's internal monologue, on the same day. It just felt like bad editing at that point.But the worst thing about these kinds of overt explanations is that they make books dull and tedious. All characters go through similar struggles, and for the most part, react to them in similar ways: people like pleasurable things, they try to avoid pain, and they're afraid of the unknown. What gives characters personality is how they experience these common reactions. It's in the little details. The more you take advantage of these little details, the more personality your characters will have.And it actually works the same with the plot: the way you reveal events and information, the way things unfold, the little details of writing create the tone. When an author wants to demonstrate something--a character's personality, the progression of a relationship, some point of politics or philosophy--he designs a scene to illustrate this point. So, if you want to show that your character is afraid of snakes, you might set up a scene where he sees a rubber snake and freaks out and maybe he feels embarrassed and holds a grudge over being fooled. It not only reveals the fear, it also reveals other aspects of the character: their pride and capacity for resentment.It's the old writer's adage about 'showing instead of telling'. When you show what a character does, you're demonstrating a distinct personality; when you tell us 'he's afraid of snakes' you're just describing a generic trait. Remove the need to show how characters react and you lose the best way to make them unique and intriguing.It makes it hard to connect with characters when they are mainly a list of traits--and it's even worse if the author doesn't actually have them demonstrate those traits. If a character is constantly described as being 'strong-willed', but is never shown actually behaving that way, then the author has failed to write the character they intended. If you show the audience something that looks, feels, smells, and tastes like an apple, they aren't going to believe it's a banana, no matter how many times you tell them it is. Because of this conflict between how the characters were described and how they actually behaved, they never developed into real personalities, and their actions rarely made sense--except that they facilitated the plot.At one point, we are told at length how much the character is worrying about some friends of his, if only he could get to them. The moment he gains the ability to reach them, he forgets about them and goes off to check something else out. Then, a bit later, this character--who has been shown as deliberate, conniving, and calculating throughout--suddenly behaves erratically and does a bunch of short-sighted, stupid things for no apparent reason, except that it lets the author put in his Big Chase Scene.Unfortunately, since the characters were shallow and undeveloped, the reason for the chase a sudden bout of stupidity, and the stakes for the chase unclear, it made the whole thing tedious, when it should have been a high point. Many authors (and summer movie directors) seem to assume that pure action and explosions are exciting, but without purpose and pacing to back them up, they are just filling space.But then, the whole book had flawed pacing; and not just because it was chock-full of tangents and redundancies. Mostly, the problem was a common one: the 'back-loaded McGuffin'. A 'McGuffin' is just a generic thing that moves the plot along, usually something a character wants. Some common examples are: the diamonds, the plans, the one ring, the magic sword, the launch codes. In general, it doesn't matter what the thing actually is, they're mostly interchangeable.Banks tries a few times to make his McGuffin more pertinent to the plot, but it's a pretty standard 'the thing'. When I talk about a 'back-loaded' plot, I mean one where all the action is constantly focused on the final conclusion. Now it's good for a story to progress toward this conclusion, but you've got to put smaller arcs and motivations along the way. Really, there should be a fairly clear goal for each distinct scene, otherwise, all of the build-up, all the tension, all the motivation is pointing at one spot--all loaded on the back, which that doesn't make for a very balanced story. Plus, no conclusion will ever be good enough to live up to four hundred pages of 'wait for it!'.What's worse is when the climax is already pretty clearly outlined and the author keeps stalling. If the reader can see what the conflict is, where it's going to take place, and more-or-less how it's going to play out, stalling is only going to annoy them. Sure, you can take a minute to have everyone watch the game-winning hit with fear and apprehension, you can even do it in slow mo with the outfielder running to the wall hoping to catch it. But if you keep cutting back to the wide-eyed faces, the outfielder running, the ball soaring, the faces again, the ball, the crowd, the ball--well, it all starts to get pretty stupid.That was how I felt as the book 'neared' the climax. It was pretty clear how it was going to play out, because we could see the stuff that needed to happen before we could move on, but Banks spends a hundred pages stalled out at roughly the same moment, going from the team, to the bad guy, to the team, to a guy thinking, to the bad guy, just showing us incrementally smaller bits of the same stuff back and forth over and over. He seemed to be trying to build tension, but there really wasn't much tension to build. A half-pat of butter will not spread over a whole loaf of bread, no matter hold long you rake it with the knife.At this point, since he's constantly returning to the characters sitting around and talking, waiting for something to happen, he actually begins to develop some personalities for them, but I quickly began to suspect that he was only doing this so he could shoe in some emotional connections before killing some off in the climax in an attempt to make their deaths more poignant. Unfortunately, that just just meant that the emotional action was telegraphing the plot--if a character is suddenly revealed to be interesting, makes a connection to the protagonist, and then finds peace with life, you can be sure they're about to bite it.Banks also telegraphs the plot when he tries to increase tension, because he will tell the reader (through exposition) about future possibilities. He'll talk about how, if the prisoner escapes and gets a gun, it won't be good for the main characters--as if that were some kind of revelation--but in every case, these are just red herrings, so it becomes easy to predict the outcomes of the book by assuming that anything the characters worry about won't happen.Now, there are some smaller arcs in the book too, so it's not all back-loaded, and some of them were okay, but they suffered from the same structural problems as the rest of the book. Many of these scenes were gory, which some people found compelling, but I didn't feel were particularly disturbing. Sure, there was violence, unpleasant people, cannibals, shit-drowning, cracked carapaces, snapped limbs, laser wounds, shrapnel, and all that stuff, but it was just flash. It might not have been pleasant but it didn't open up any unsettling psychological implications. As with personality and tone, it's not the bare fact of violence that is disturbing, but its specific treatment, its implications. Just as explosions don't equal an exciting plot, slasher gore doesn't equal tension.The weirdly effusive voice of a nominally neutral omniscient narrator was only one part of a rather silly tone in the book. I found most of the ship names quite cleverly funny, but in general, the jokey tone was a poor match for a brooding book of life-or-death consequences. The whole epilogue actually hinges on a tacked-on punchline, which made me wonder if this book wasn't just the longest Shaggy Dog Joke I've ever read.This book also hit another genre trend: the protagonist collecting women. You can always spot it when a woman walks in the room and gets a description several times as long as any male character. Often, this description will be repeated or echoed every time that female character reenters the room, while many male characters will persist throughout the book in a vague, featureless haze.These women always start off cool and distant, but keep coming to the protagonist, bantering with him adversarially, but playfully--there's never any real conflict between them, just enough tension to sweeten the pot. I found the central romance particularly disappointing because it comes out of nowhere. I actually appreciated at first how the characters seemed to take a nonchalant, almost awkward approach--it made sense considering all the other things they had on their mind--but then, suddenly, it's all lovey-dovey and everyone is spouting awkward platitudes:""What she did not know about him was only what he did not know about himself (but that, he told himself, was quite a lot still). Perhaps she even knew him better than he knew himself.""There is never anything resembling real thoughts or emotions in the entire relationship, and it rather reminded me of Scriptshadow's observation about the film Aliens: namely, that love stories don't fit into every scenario, particularly not tense, difficult ones where characters are thrown together, under constant stress, and plot takes a backseat to worldbuilding. In such a case, an attempt to add a love story is always going to feel like an extra shovelful of clutter tossed on the pile.I said earlier that the prose wasn't bad, but the figurative language smacks of trying too hard; it's not a natural part of the authorial voice but an intrusion of forced poetics:"" . . . a thousand-kilometer peninsula sticking out into a frozen sea like some monstrous fractured limb set in plaster.""A lot of the figurative language is written weakly, without confidence, as the 'like some' above indicates--whenever you see 'like some kind of' or 'it almost seemed as if', you know an author was struggling with their voice. Unlike William Gibson's direct, assertive style, Banks' metaphors are often vague. Metaphors are intended to provide the reader with a more clear and physical comprehension of the world, not with a cloudy possibility of 'some' resemblance. We also have:""He put his head back to her chest, nestling it between her breasts like a huge, delicate egg.""and a couple pages later, of a different woman (same protagonist):"" . . . taking his hand and bringing it to her mouth, kissing it, stroking it as thought it were a small, defenseless animal.""So in one fell stroke we have redundant repetition, awkward metaphors, and cheesy romance.Not only are the emotions flat (due to the expositional method of characterization), they're also surprisingly modern and staid, especially for a story about alien cultures. Love, gender, pride, religion, and most other traits are played fairly straight. We do have a noble warrior race in there, but that's hardly less cliche, just being the sci fi version of the 'Noble Savage'. Banks will sometimes talk about purported differences in personality, but as usual, these are never actually demonstrated by the characters themselves. This isn't necessarily a problem if you're writing a light, accessible Space Opera story, but it's detrimental to a ponderous, meandering book that relies on a more complex, unusual setting. The actual science elements are also rather unremarkable, even for the period. Much of the plot relies on a strict delineation between robots and humans, focused mainly on a false dichotomy of emotion vs. logic. I've always found this silly, not just because emotions are logical (you can't have logical thought if the emotional center of the brain is damaged), but also because there is no reason that humans won't progress along with robots as technology increases. In all likelihood, humans and robots will progress toward one another as time goes on until there is no functional definition which separates one from the other.Now some of this is meant to be overplayed in the book; we're not supposed to fall entirely for this point of view, which is nice, I appreciate the ambiguity. Yet, Banks doesn't have any new insights about the similarities and differences between robots and humans, either.Lack of insight was a general problem. There were very few moments where I felt surprised or spurred to thought by Banks' story. Everything was laid out in front of me, explained, repeated, and followed the basic rules of the genre without introducing any new innovation. Yes, the narrator was morally ambiguous, but I would have appreciated that more if it didn't merely seem to be a symptom of ambiguity in general.In some ways ways, it resembles The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but without the humor. It has the big set pieces, characters hopping all over, a rather silly, self-aware tone, and a lot of asides about the universe--but lacked the style and satirical insight that made that series such a delight. Unfortunately, the most interesting and intellectual part of Consider Phlebas is the title, and the rest never manages to live up to that promise.As far as Space Operas are concerned, Hitchhiker's Guide is earlier, more intelligent, and more fun, with better pacing and writing. This book had about 230 pages of plot, character, and world buried in 500 pages of redundant explanations, appendices, exposition, explosions, gore, gross outs, and digressions. I wasn't wowed by speculative insight, intrigued by unpredictability, or amused by an exciting story. I found much of the book dull and overwrought, which may have made for a quick read, but not a particularly enjoyable one.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8935689-consider-phlebas
Foundation's Edge;Isaac Asimov;1982;1980;450;4.18;91693;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy', 'Hugo Awards'];"At last, the costly and bitter war between the two Foundations had come to an end. The scientists of the First Foundation had proved victorious; and now they return to Hari Seldon's long-established plan to build a new Empire on the ruins of the old. But rumors persist that the Second Foundation is not destroyed after all—and that its still-defiant survivors are preparing their revenge. Now two exiled citizens of the Foundation—a renegade Councilman and a doddering historian—set out in search of the mythical planet Earth. . .and proof that the Second Foundation still exists.Meanwhile someone—or something—outside of both Foundations seems to be orchestrating events to suit its own ominous purpose. Soon representatives of both the First and Second Foundations will find themselves racing toward a mysterious world called Gaia and a final shocking destiny at the very end of the universe!";That´s at least as good as the original, especially because it explains everything, has some big, we are so small, moments, and adds an extra layer of depth to the Foundation myth, ending it so smoothly that I will just pretend that there were no other, far weaker parts. Never!Change in style throughout a careerAsimovs´evolution towards an a bit less complicated and, sometimes, difficult to follow author can be seen here too. While the original Foundation is reaching Clarke and Lem levels of integrating so many innuendos and ideas that little minds like mine get blown, Foundations´edge is a far easier to enter and follow milestone of satiric, smart sci fi. Now that´s a good illustration of how unimportant humankind really isBut of course I won´t tell you why, because this would be evil spoilering, but just be prepared to get shown how unimportant, tiny, and helpless we little naked apes really are. This also includes some sudden plot twists one doesn´t see coming that let one dive deeper into the world of Foundation.Psi vs tech, hearth vs logic, emotional vs rationalWhat a great, old premise to make a story, especially if some kind of mysterious plot is rotating around the motivations of 2 perfectly coordinated fractions. Good old alien influenceJust the moment one starts thinking about pretty badass humans, aliens come and make humans look so small. It may be difficult to follow this whole thing, because it is somewhat interlinked to the rest of the series too, but can easily be ignored too because it isn´t really an essential part of the actual story. But it´s a pretty fine bonus goodie for the ones who are already into this monumental epos.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76683.Foundation_s_Edge
Prelude to Foundation;Isaac Asimov;1988;1980;464;4.16;89787;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera'];It is the year 12,020 G.E. and Emperor Cleon I sits uneasily on the Imperial throne of Trantor. Here in the great multidomed capital of the Galactic Empire, forty billion people have created a civilization of unimaginable technological and cultural complexity. Yet Cleon knows there are those who would see him fall—those whom he would destroy if only he could read the future. Hari Seldon has come to Trantor to deliver his paper on psychohistory, his remarkable theory of prediction. Little does the young Outworld mathematician know that he has already sealed his fate and the fate of humanity. For Hari possesses the prophetic power that makes him the most wanted man in the Empire. . .the man who holds the key to the future—an apocalyptic power to be known forever after as the Foundation.;As great as the original Foundation series with an extra portion of wit and humor, thereby more focused on society, characters, and human behavior than on psychohistory and big meta worldbuilding as in the original trilogy. Heroes journey throughout innuendos and satirical deconstructionof universities, faith, governments, and poverty fueled by discrimination and racism. That´s so sharp, in society's face, and ingenious that it raises Lem far above Clarke and Heinlein (facepalming fueled by external shame), making him seem like a kind of easygoing Lem without the depressing and far over the top and hyper complicated mega philosophy. Great, funny characters in ingenious constellationsGet ready to giggle, because it´s not just the slapstick situational comedy element that is big in here, but, as mentioned the amalgamation with satirizing every system humans created. The already hilarious main characters get in trouble with other characters that are made wacky by the inherent madness of the societies they´re living in.  RobotsAsimov just couldn´t withstand the temptation of adding some androids to the mix, probably with connections to some of his other works, prequels or sequels of the Foundation, and his robots series and short story collections. I am not sure about this, because it´s already complicated enough to keep track of the whole universe without trying to vivisect what extra easter eggs the author might have hidden. A little suspense thriller plotline in the backgroundAsimov just needs that, but in contrast to other, far more difficult to follow works, it´s also much less complicated to follow and not the main plotline. Subjectively, I even had some problems with his suspense thriller novels, because they reduced the sci-fi level a bit too much to focus on the characterization of the hidden robot, murderer, or wacky AI (also not quite sure about the last one, I´m a notoriously unreliable narrator. Better try not to remember and absorb too much of the pointless, unserious drivel I´m secluding) Why not the same quality all the time?Asimovs´ later works are strongly fluctuating in reading pleasure and quality, even seem to somehow be written with focus on different elements, once mostly plot, then just characters, another time an average and lengthy balance of both. This may strongly be linked to the fact that evil fans and publishers kind of forced him to continue writing at a moment he didn´t really want anymore. Until they gave him 10 times as much money as usual, lol. His widow later said that he simply ran out of ideas.  Start reading it here!Who still hasn´t begun the Foundation series, lucky enviable you, should initialize with this one, because it´s a much funnier and easier entrance to one of the best sci-fi worlds ever created than the hardcore original trilogy. Asimov doesn´t have to demonstrate anything anymore and can focus on fun, wit, characters, and a much more easygoing style than in the much more sophisticated, philosophical, complex, and thereby somewhat difficult to read original series. I still haven´t read the second prequel Forward to Foundation, but it seems to have good ratings and may the recommended reading in chronological order material too.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30013.Prelude_to_Foundation
State of Fear;Michael Crichton;1987;1980;672;3.7;88142;no;['Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Science Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Suspense', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Adventure'];In Paris, a physicist dies after performing a laboratory experiment for a beautiful visitor. In the jungles of Malaysia, a mysterious buyer purchases deadly cavitation technology, built to his specifications. In Vancouver, a small research submarine is leased for use in the waters off New Guinea. And in Tokyo, an intelligence agent tries to understand what it all means. Thus begins Michael Crichton's exciting and provocative technothriller, State of Fear. Only Michael Crichton's unique ability to blend science fact and pulse-pounding fiction could bring such disparate elements to a heart-stopping conclusion. This is Michael Crichton's most wide-ranging thriller. State of Fear takes the reader from the glaciers of Iceland to the volcanoes of Antarctica, from the Arizona desert to the deadly jungles of the Solomon Islands, from the streets of Paris to the beaches of Los Angeles. The novel races forward, taking the reader on a rollercoaster thrill ride, all the while keeping the brain in high gear. Gripping and thought-provoking, State of Fear is Michael Crichton at his very best.;"I remain scared.  A physicist murdered in strange circumstances in Paris, a deadly innovative technology changing hands in Malaysia, an uncommon type of submarine released in the waters in Vancouver; everything points to an underground eco-terrorist organization and a massive worldwide conspiracy brewing from the shadows. Peter Evans, a lawyer investigating NERF, and Sarah Jones, a billionaire’s assistant, and a few others, the only people on earth that may be able to uncover the whole truth behind it and, if possible, stop it, before the world is torn asunder.From Paris to Iceland and Antarctica, from Arizona desert to Los Angeles and the jungles of Solomon Islands. A massively scoped techno-thriller, blending science and fiction, like only a consummated author can deliver. Truth be told the protagonists are barely memorable at all, but the story more than certainly is, and by a longshot. This was my first and only Crichton so far and at first glance you can easily tell why the author has amassed such fan base and cult following. This was more than a decade ago and the chills of it still resonating strong with me.This was a never ending nail-biting global rollercoaster from beginning to end, without stops. A globe spanning adventure and thought-provoking novel about the unavoidable dangers of global warming. Truly fantastic. Looking forward to reading much more of the author, someday.*** WHA?

Un tecno- thriller de alcance masivo, mezclando ciencia y ficción, como sólo un autor consumado podría entregar. La verdad que es que los protagonistas son bastante olvidables, pero la historia es ciertamente más que memorable, y por mucho. Este fue mi primer y único Crichton hasta el momento y a primera vista se puede apreciar fácilmente por qué el autor amasó semejante cantidad de fans y calidad de culto. Esto fue más de una década atrás y los escalofríos todavía siguen resonando fuerte en mí.Esto fue una interminable montaña rusa para morderse las uñas desde el principio hasta el final, sin paradas. Una aventura de alcance global y novela provocadoramente reflexiva sobre los peligros inevitables del calentamiento global. Verdaderamente fantástica. Con grandes ansías de leer mucho más del autor, algún día.*** ¿QUE? ¡¿No hay película?! Necesito mi película, ¡diantres!-----------------------------------------------

But which god, wonders holistic detective Dirk Gently? What god would be hanging around Heathrow trying to catch the 3:37 to Oslo? And what has this to do with Dirk's latest--and late-- client, found only this morning with his head revolving atop the hit record ""Hot Potato""? Amid the hostile attentions of a stray eagle and the trauma of a very dirty refrigerator, super-sleuth Dirk Gently will once again solve the mysteries of the universe...";“The impossible often has a kind of integrity to it which the merely improbable lacks.”So the title The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Souli s so fantastic! And the randomness, quirkiness and interesting meditations of Douglas Adams's detective, Dirk Gently, matches the tone set by that title. The novel even features the Norse Gods in the modern world (reminding me of Neil Gaiman's American Gods). Definitely a different take on Thor than you'll see in the superhero movies. The mystery/plot(s) are less the point here than simply taking the journey. In that respect, there's a commonality with Adams' more famous Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. Getting to the restaurant at the end of the universe, for instance, is more important than the destination. For me, the randomness can be too random at times and not at all connected to plot, but again, I know that wasn't the point. I enjoyed! 3.75 stars. “It can hardly be a coincidence that no language on earth has ever produced the expression, 'As pretty as an airport.”;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357.The_Long_Dark_Tea_Time_of_the_Soul
Galápagos;Kurt Vonnegut Jr.;1985;1980;324;3.87;83156;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American'];Galápagos takes the reader back one million years, to A.D. 1986. A simple vacation cruise suddenly becomes an evolutionary journey. Thanks to an apocalypse, a small group of survivors stranded on the Galápagos Islands are about to become the progenitors of a brave, new, and totally different human race. In this inimitable novel, America’s master satirist looks at our world and shows us all that is sadly, madly awry—and all that is worth saving.;Galápagos is Kurt Vonnegut’s satirical tribute to Charles Darwin. The narrator of the tale is a ghost existing for a million years and witnessing everything from the beginning to the end.“Nothing could be less inviting than the first appearance. A broken field of black basaltic lava, thrown into the most rugged waves, and crossed by great fissures, is everywhere covered by stunted, sun-burnt brushwood, which shows little signs of life. The dry and parched surface, being heated by the noon-day sun, gave to the air a close and sultry feeling, like that from a stove: we fancied even that the bushes smelt unpleasantly.” Charles Darwin – The Voyage of the BeagleThe story is also a spoof of Noah’s Ark but instead of landing on Mount Ararat the ship lands on one of the islands in the Galápagos archipelago. And instead of evolution Kurt Vonnegut depicts a devolution.Back when childhoods were often so protracted, it is unsurprising that so many people got into the lifelong habit of believing, even after their parents were gone, that somebody was always watching over them – God or a saint or a guardian angel or the stars or whatever.People have no such illusions today. They learn very early what kind of a world this really is, and it is a rare adult indeed who hasn’t seen a careless sibling or parent eaten alive by a killer whale or shark.Nowadays, with all the consumerism, conformism and hypocrisy surrounding us, individuals just lose their true identity and the devolution has probably already begun.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9593.Gal_pagos

A superorganism, Gaia is a holistic planet with a common consciousness so intensely united that every dewdrop, every pebble, every being, can speak for all—and feel for all. It is a realm in which privacy is not only undesirable, it is incomprehensible. But is it the right choice for the destiny of mankind? While Trevize feels it is, that is not enough. He must know. Trevize believes the answer lies at the site of humanity's roots: fabled Earth . . . if it still exists. For no one is sure where the planet of Gaia's first settlers is to be found in the immense wilderness of the Galaxy. Nor can anyone explain why no record of Earth has been preserved, no mention of it made anywhere in Gaia's vast world-memory. It is an enigma Trevize is determined to resolve, and a quest he is determined to undertake, at any cost.[ Original description here: Горстка смельчаков пытается найти прародину человечества - Землю, чтобы получить разгадку тайн истории Галактики. = A handful of brave souls trying to find humanity's ancestral home—the Earth, to get answers to the mysteries of the history of the Galaxy.];Foundation and Earth (Foundation #5), Isaac AsimovFoundation and Earth is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, the fifth novel of the Foundation series and chronologically the last in the series. It was published in 1986, four years after the first sequel to the Foundation trilogy, which is titled Foundation's Edge. Several centuries after the events of Second Foundation, two citizens of the Foundation seek to find Earth, the legendary planet where humans are said to have originated. Even less is known about Earth than was the case in Foundation, when scholars still seem to know the location of 'Sol'. The story follows on from Foundation's Edge, but can be read as a complete work in itself.

The Player of Games;Iain M. Banks;1988;1980;293;4.28;74202;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Cultural'];The Culture - a humanoid/machine symbiotic society - has thrown up many great Game Players. One of the best is Jernau Morat Gurgeh, Player of Games, master of every board, computer and strategy. Bored with success, Gurgeh travels to the Empire of Azad, cruel & incredibly wealthy, to try their fabulous game, a game so complex, so like life itself, that the winner becomes emperor. Mocked, blackmailed, almost murdered, Gurgeh accepts the game and with it the challenge of his life, and very possibly his death.;"That´s Brave new world and 1984 on space opera steroids, one of the best allegories on human culture ever written, described from the point of view of an objective observer of a far higher developed civilization who visits the primitive, cruel, capitalistic, hierarchical bigots. Us in our past, current, and future manifestations of madness and more or less hidden dictatorship government styles. This reread in 2 sittings blew me away so hard that I´m hardly able to do more than to suggest to freaking read this masterpiece as soon as possible. Immediately, go, quickly, forget the rest of the review, don´t waste your time with it, go, enjoy, and get wiser by the way. There's is nothing coming close to this out there.Maybe best to start the amazing journey hereI had the luck to read this, probably his best novel, as one of the first out of Banks´ amazing universe and in contrast to the other, often very complex, eclectic, and multi-plotted novels it stays focused on the main premise to show us how freaking average and dull we are. I guess Banks did it on purpose, as a stylistic element, to say much with less, and because it might have seemed inappropriate and weird to mix present day history with the lighter space opera elements and humor of his other novels. Owning everythingThere are more or less direct in your face satires, comments, and criticism of how capital, ownership, and debt let a society degenerate to neofeudalism, the disadvantages of monogamy under a theocratic regime, slavery in the form of military service with punishments such as death penalty, sexual restrictions and sexism, selling talent and lifetime to the ones who can effort to buy it, the institutionalization of tradition to condition the population, prison system, slums, unfair fiscal and tax systems that make the rich richer and the poor poorer, total fixation on socioeconomic status manifesting in the behavior of each specific group, superficial trends, kings and gods emperors, controlled propaganda media, permanent warmongering, an extreme income gap, sedating the population with cheap booze, bread, and games, etc. It´s nothing more than an exact description of what most, even democratic countries, are moving and degenerating towards while doing as if the end of history has created a utopia for everyone. Everything is the game aka the predatory behavior to rise to the top of a mountain of corpses by actively producing them.To integrate ""The game"" as an element of selection in an authoritarian government is a marvelous plot vehicle, looking at you, Hunger Games, Battle Royale, The Long Walk, etc., but mixing it with higher, superior entities that could wipe the floor with the dictators while optimizing quantum gravity time dilation multiverse theoretical physics stuff with the other, (and doing whatever with as many hands, tentacles (I know what some of you are thinking now, shame on you!),... as they wish to have and create gripping devices by telekinetic manifesting them with gray/green goo nanotech in nanoseconds. nano nano nano) makes it both entertaining and insightful. Show them who is boss and philosophyAlthough it might be unrealistic that any evil despots might take the risk of participating in unfaked, unmanipulated competitions instead of letting the suppressed population kill each other in epic battles to keep them calm Roman emperor style. Except the tech is so highly advanced and secure and the probability of black swans so unlikely that they come down from their throne from time to time to slay their own people directly and under frenetic applause instead of conventionally killing them with secret police and incompetent agriculture politics to make Malthus happy. Another aspect is that the style the game is played depends on the cruelty and inhumanity of the culture participating in it and that it would be possible to play it in a cultivated, mind opened and friendly way with emancipated, enlightened citizens of a post scarcity society. Something no government really wants, so they prefer war and genocides. Only Lem and Banks play in the same leagueJust this moment I am realizing for the first time that Banks could be compared to Stanislaw Lem, another author that dived so marvelous and smooth into the depts and dirt of human nature. Of course, Lems´ complexity is unreached and the space opera focus makes the comparison difficult in some regard, but the authors' main intentions seem similar to me, especially because their dark sarcasm is unreached by all other titans of the genre.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18630.The_Player_of_Games

The remnants of the Old Empire have been consumed by the violent matriarchal cult known as the Honored Matres. Only one faction remains a viable threat to their total conquest--the Bene Gesserit, heirs to Dune's power.Under the leadership of Mother Superior Darwi Odrade, the Bene Gesserit have colonized a green world on the planet Chapterhouse and are turning it into a desert, mile by scorched mile. And once they've mastered breeding sandworms, the Sisterhood will control the production of the greatest commodity in the known galaxy--the spice melange. But their true weapon remains a man who has lived countless lifetimes--a man who served under the God Emperor Paul Muad'Dib....;"[ Villeneuve film reviews at the bottom of this article ]Introductory notes:Some initial notes for building my impressions of Dune where book references are denoted by D1-D6 for the 6 volumes of the trilogy - warning - there are some spoilers below, but once again if you have read this far into the Dune series, they are hardly spoilers because you already know all of this, or most of it.Royal HousesAtreidesHarkonnen CorinnoIt is interesting to me that despite the massive scale of Dune, it remains a tale concerning really only three families (initially) competing for power.Power BasesBene Geserit (female)Bene Tleilaxu (male -females reduced to living axlotl tanks for breeding (D5)Ix (unknown, only contact with male ambassadors)Honored Matres (female - returning Bene Geserit from the Scattering hellbent on destruction)There are also only three extra-royal organizations (and later a fourth) that operate within the walls of the first 6 books. Of course, each of these (yet not always described in a homogeneous amount of detail) are incredibly complex societies with interesting dynamics which made for great reading. ReligionsZensunni (overall fusion of Islam and Zen Buddhism which is sort of the ambient religion across the Known Universe)Sufi (closely related to Zensunni - very close to Bene Tleilaxu core beliefs)Freemen Worship of Leto II / the God Emperor / the Tyrant (for Bene Geserit) / Guldur (for Honored Matres)Orange Catholic (remnants of Roman Catholic faith)Note: The Bene Geserit, while originally derived at least partially from Roman Catholic Monastical practices views religion as a tool for manipulating the masses and opportunistically plays religions off each other)I liked the mashup of Zen Buddhism and Islam and found that it was a creative way of projecting out human development. One should note that - other than perhaps futars late in D5 and D6), no aliens are in the Known Universe so the humans are all descendants of a diaspore from Terra in the distant past. The idea being that the Zen Buddhists and those of the Muslim faith blended together whereas - apparently - the Roman Catholics split into Bene Geserit and then disappeared. I found no mention at all of polytheist beliefs such as Hinduism or Dualism beliefs such as Taoism. ArmiesSaudukar (males from Salusa Secundus in service of Harkonnens and Shaddam IV of the Corrino family)Fish Speakers (females from Rakis in serivce of Leto II)Honored Matres (females with mix of various Scattering populations with sexual skills honed to an extreme but also the physical prowess of the Bene Geserit but with extreme violence and no regret or pity)Bene Geserit (females with extreme martial arts skills and body control)Some of the most exciting writing in Dune is of course the battle scenes and it is interesting how the elite forces switch from all-male to all-female on the advent of Leto II. The Honored Matres are pretty badass (and very scary) and it was awesome how Miles Teg evolved into a godlike fighter before his doom on Dune.PlanetsDune / Arrakis / Rakis (home to the Freemen, planet of the Sandworms, sole natural source of melange in Known Universe)Caladan (home planet to Atreides clan)Giedi Prime / Gammu (home to Harkonnens)Salusa Secundus (prison planet - previous home to House Corrino)Hidden Chapterhouse planet (home to Bene Geserit)Tleilax (home to Tleilaxu)Ix (home to Ixians)Junction(s) (waystations for the Guild Navigators)I was frustrated that we never visited Is or Tleilax and learned precious little about any planets besides Dune, Giedi Prime/Gammu and Chapterhouse. One would think that in a galaxy of billions and trillions that there would be more planets, but I suppose that Frank needed to simplify somewhere.Bene Geserit hierarchyMother SuperiorReverend MotherBreeding MothersAcolytes (1st Degree - 3rd Degree)The BG became a sort of mashup of the military and a female monastic order that was interesting to read about.

I will write a long post here with plenty of quotes summing up all my Dune impressions for those who wish to read them.""When she thought of the largely passive non-Bene Desert populace 'out there', Odrade sometime envied them. They were permitted their illusions. What a comfort. You could pretend your life was forever, that tomorrow would be better, that the gods in heaven watched you with care."" (p. 49)Odrade is the daughter of Bandar Mentat (and overall badass mofo) Miles Teg who becomes Mother Superior of the Bene Geserit following the events at the end of Heretics of Dune. She has a deadly standoff with the Honored Matres which dominates Chapterhouse (the hidden BG headquarters planet). She is a great character - full of depth and insight such as the quote above. The Bene Geserit thanks to melange and some genetic engineering created a form of immortality which is threatened with extinction by the Matres flooding into the Old Empire from The Scattering (see God Emperor and Heretics) and Odrade's strategy is a fascinating one to see being put together and then executed.""The presence of Others Within who subtracted none of her attention from what went on around her had filled her with awe. We call it. Simuflow. Speaker had said. Simuflow multiplies your awareness."" (p. 60)Chapterhouse opened a whole new line of inquiry into the fate of Israel with the characters of the Rabbi and Rebecca - the few last remnants of the diaspora now on a galactic scale. Rebecca is pulled into the Bene Geserit in order to save the Others Within that were massacred on Lampadas by the Honored Matres. While this is an interesting interlude, it is a little frustrating that Herbert throws this in in only the last book of the series and dies before developing this idea any further. The primary interest of this interlude was in fact a bit more information on how the Bene Geserit functioned with the Others Within which was helpful in better understanding them.""God formed me to deceive the powindah! His slight, childlike appearance was formed in a grey skin whose metallic pigments blocked scanning probes. His diminutive shape distracted those who saw him and hid the powers he had accumulated in serial ghola incarnations."" (p. 84)The last Tleilaxu, Scytale, was an interesting character. Tleilaxu having been destroyed by the Honored Matres, Scytale is a prisoner on the no-ship on Chapterhouse. Perhaps Herbert sensed the end coming because the potential he built into this character (especially the whispering which was supposed to serve as a trigger for the ghola of Duncan Idaho) was never exploited in this book. That being said, he is fairly one-dimensional and serves as almost an albeit morbid comic relief. ""Honored Matre assumptions about control fascinated Lucilla. You controlled your universe; you did not balance with it. You did not train yourself to sense your own subtle responses, you produced muscles (forces, powers) to overcome everything you defined as an obstacle. Were these women blind?"" (p. 100)Lucilla was one of the most enigmatic and powerful characters in the later Dune trilogy I found. Here she is prisoner to the HM and studying them hoping to get a message to Odrade in time for the BG to prepare a defense. It was interesting to compare the BG before Paul/Leto II/The Scattering (all powerful, mystical, and mega fighters who subjugated emotion completely and sex as a precise weapon and the BG who viewed sex only as reproductive function. The key issue in Dune is the disruptive impact of LOVE which ignites the first crisis in D1 when Lady Jessica falls in love with Leto I and rather than giving birth to a girl as her Bene Geserit masters would expect her to do, gives birth to Paul who then exhibits characteristics of the Kwisatz Haderach and becomes Maud'dib to the Freemen when he survives the BG test and achieves prescience. Paul’s love for Chani of the Fremen dooms his political mariage to Princess Irulan and it is Chani that bears his two children, the preborn twins Ghamina and Leto II, soon to be God Emperor and to set humanity on the Golden Path. The next crisis occurs because Leto II loves humanity and wants them to survive. The last crisis is when Duncan Idaho and Murbella fall in love and do not fulfill (once again) BG plans. Unfortunately, we never really get to the end to know whether ""love conquers all"" or just fucks everything up.Fantastic and legendary read. Please comment![UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below.[UPDATE 2] It has been a few months, but personally I felt that Villeneuve’s Dune was respectful both of the spirit of the original books and of Lynch’s cult classic movie.[UPDATE 3] Villeneuve made one of sci-fi’s greatest sophomore movies with Dune 2.

Swan Song;Robert McCammon;1987;1980;956;4.29;69922;no;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Apocalyptic'];An ancient evil roams the desolate landscape of an America ravaged by nuclear war. He is the Man with the Scarlet Eye, a malevolent force that feeds on the dark desires of the countless followers he has gathered into his service. His only desire is to find a special child named Swan—and destroy her. But those who would protect the girl are determined to fight for what is left of the world, and their souls. In a wasteland born of rage, populated by monstrous creatures and marauding armies, the last survivors on earth have been drawn into the final battle between good and evil that will decide the fate of humanity....;"Once upon a time, a man decided to read Robert McCammon’s book. It became one of the best decisions he has ever made.
“I used to be an optimist, a long time ago. I used to believe in miracles. But do you know what happened? I got older. And the world got meaner.”
I did not start my journey reading McCammon's books here. My first time reading McCammon's book was four years ago, and it was a book depicting a coming-of-age story of a Boy’s Life in Zephyr, Alabama. Reading that book felt like finding a gold mine to harvest. I did not look for it; it called me to read it suddenly. And somehow, Boy's Life became one of my favorite books. Ever. If you know my reading taste, you will most likely know that my favorite genres to read are epic fantasy, science fiction, and historical fiction. I rarely venture outside these three genres. Not because I avoid other genres, but mostly because I still have SO MANY books I want to read in my three favorite genres. But I like to occasionally read outside of my comfort zone. That usually leads me to read literary fiction or horror novels. I will argue that, sometimes, horror can be categorized as fantasy as well, and I think Swan Song has some elements that belong in the fantasy genre due to some of its emphasis on supernatural and magical elements. But anyway, if you have heard the title Swan Song, you might have heard it is often compared or judged against The Stand by Stephen King, another super popular and highly praised post-apocalyptic fiction. And where do I stand on my judgment? I think The Stand is great, Swan Song is vastly superior. So this isn't just a review of Swan Song, but also a comparison of my experience reading The Stand and Swan Song for the first time, and why at the end of the day I think the latter is better.
“How many could possibly be still alive in that holocaust, he wondered. No. A better question was: How many would want to be alive? Because in his briefings and research on nuclear warfare, one thing was very clear to him: The hundreds of millions who perished in the first few hours would be the lucky ones. It was the survivors who would endure a thousand forms of damnation.”
Swan Song is arguably Robert McCammon’s most famous book. Similar to The Stand, it is one of the most highly-praised post-apocalyptic classics, and I will contribute my resounding praises to it. Stephen King did a superb job in showing the terrifying effects of a deadly plague that almost annihilated the entire USA in The Stand. Swan Song did not revolve around a plague. Instead, McCammon terrifically displayed the devastating results of World War III, or in other words, nuclear war. As you can guess, America, as it was, is gone forever, and every surviving citizen has to go beyond their utmost best to survive the aftermath of this calamity in a brutal wasteland born of rage, fear, radiations, monstrous creatures, and marauding armies. This is probably not a unique premise for a novel, especially not in 2022, but remember, this book was first published in 1987, and McCammon's execution of the story instantly hooked me. Swan Song truly stand out and deserves its classic status. I am serious about this. From how the crimson tornado of fire advanced and filled the sky, blue streaks of lightning lanced through the clouds, tons of blackened earth gouged, and a million dreams of humanity shattered hypnotized my mind-vision, I knew from the beginning through the way it is written that I was in the presence of a special book.
“Thinking about how many millions might be lying dead out there warped Josh’s mind, like trying to figure out how big the universe was, or how many billions of stars winked in the skies. But right now there was just this little girl, sobbing in his arms, and she could never see the world in the same way as before. No matter what happened to them she would forever be marked by this moment—and Josh knew he would as well.”
It is bloody incredible. McCammon tells a story filled with themes I've read about countless times, but the deliverance was nothing short of outstanding. Swan Song can get pretty bleak, violent, and depressing. There's no doubt about that. Horrible actions were undoubtedly accomplished, and one among many things in the book, let's not even get started on how creepy Job's Mask is. I did not know anything about this book entering into it, except that it is a post-apocalyptic novel, and I was surprised (in a good way) by some of the events and descriptions in the book. In its horror aspect, I think the description of Job's Mask is one of the creepiest and most unnerving imagery I've ever read. However, it would be a huge mistake to say Swan Song was utterly full of darkness. 
“God A’mighty, what’s the point of livin’ if you don’t fight for what you hold dear?”
One of the most dominant themes of Swan Song is to find and brighten that tiny light of hope in the forced immersion of ruinous landscape and evil. The definition of a swan song in our world is a metaphorical phrase for the final gesture, effort, or performance given before death or retirement. And it fits this book. In this story of good versus evil (just like The Stand) or defiance against malevolent force, through the ensemble cast of characters, McCammon explored the meaning of a man letting the real beast within taking control of themselves. But more importantly, McCammon also examined the importance of virtue in the presence of despair and destruction. McCammon achieved this by using his characters, prose, and multiple plot device, and I think everything was done brilliantly.
“Everybody’s got two faces, child—the outside face and the inside face. The outside face is how the world sees you, but the inside face is what you really look like. It’s your true face, and if it was flipped to the outside you’d show the world what kind of person you are.”
I thoroughly loved McCammon’s prose. I already voiced this when I read Boy’s Life, and even though Swan Song is done in a different tone and narration style to Boy’s Life, it was once again, excellent. Here’s the thing. McCammon employed a third-person omniscient narration style here; this is something common in novels published in the 80s and early 90s. It is also, statistically, one of my pet peeves, and why books published pre-1990 tend to not work with me. I often find third-person omniscient narration or head-hopping jarring and distracting to my immersion and investment in the story and characters. In one paragraph, I read the story from one character’s thoughts, and in the next one, I have to read the story from another character’s perspective. There's nothing wrong with doing this, but personally, having this repeated throughout the book USUALLY ends up annoying me. But that is not the case with Swan Song. I was incredibly invested in all the main characters. Protagonists or antagonists, the narrative always felt engaging and intimate. McCammon nailed the voice of every single character so distinctly. I never felt distracted; skillful focus and care were put toward the characterizations, character relationship, and their respective development. 
“Swan wanted to know more about everything—to learn to read better, if books could be found; to ask questions and learn to listen; to learn to think and reason things out. But she never wanted to grow up all the way, because she feared the grown-up world; it was a bully with a fat stomach and a mean mouth who stomped on gardens before they had a chance to grow.”
Every character has a crucial role in Swan Song. Swan, Josh, Sister, Paul, Mule, Killer, Robin, and the despicable Roland and Macklin. Nothing felt wasted on the tome. If I discuss the magnificence of each character in this review, we will spend all day talking about this book. Instead, I will say this. If I'm forced to choose favorites, Swan, Josh, and Sister were my favorite characters in the book. Even more so for Swan and Josh because this duo embodied some of my favorite tropes to their maximum effect: found family and badass and child duo. How this duo endured, persevered, fought, and cared for each other in the apocalypse was inspirational. And you know what, amazing characterizations is also one of the main things that made The Stand by Stephen King—mostly—so damn good. What is it that made Swan Song better than The Stand for me, then? Well, at 303,000 words, which is shorter than The Stand by more or less 160,000 words, and I know this might enrage some of Stephen King's fans, Swan Song is much more worthwhile and ultimately more satisfying and rewarding to me.
“She knew also that he’d almost taken the apple, but at the last second his unthinking rage and pride had won. And she’d seen that he hated her and hated himself for wanting to take a step beyond what he was; but he’d been afraid of her, too, and as she’d watched him stagger away Swan had realized that forgiveness crippled evil, drew the poison from it like lancing a boil.”
I will say straight out say this as simple as possible. I think The Stand has one of the most disappointing and anti-climactic ending sequences I've ever read. I just cannot believe, after reading through 400,000 words and more than 1,000 pages long, after all the awesome build-up and development, the final confrontation itself started and ended so instantaneously. It left a sour taste in my mouth, and I found this lack of intense action scenes quite common in older novels. Again, there's nothing wrong with shorter battle or confrontation scenes. But I, as a reader, especially when I'm reading an epic scale novel (whatever the genre is), I'm the type of reader who prefers a long pulse-pounding set of action/climax sequences. And Swan Song, despite being published in 1987, delivered that for me. I read the final—more or less—200 pages of Swan Song in one sitting. Believe me when I say, with how busy I am now in my life, compelling me to read 200 pages in one sitting is close to impossible. But all the meticulous build-up and crescendo toward the epic convergence resulted in unforgettably explosive, breathtaking, and emotional final pages. Sleeping hours were happily sacrificed as I greeted the dawn of a new day after devouring such a gratifying reading experience.
“Finding someone you loved, and someone who loved you, was half the battle.”
Swan Song is one of the best post-apocalyptic stories I've read, and it is also one of the best standalone novels of all time. It is dark, violent, engaging, filled with profound hope and beauty, and extremely worthwhile. Swan Song has been called a classic for decades, and I think it rightfully earned its legendary status. Out of McCammon's long bibliography of books, I've read only Boy’s Life and Swan Song, and both of them are included in my list of favorite books and standalone novels of all time. That's two for two. I already feel at ease calling Robert McCammon one of my favorite authors. One more favorite book from him, and he will certainly be on my list of favorite authors of all time. I still have so many books by McCammon to read, and now I am struck with a dilemma. What is next? Well, after doing research and hearing many great things, I think my next venture with McCammon's books will not be a standalone, but it will be a series. The series is named Matthew Corbett. I cannot predict when I will read the series yet, as it depends on my reading mood, but I heard there is only one book left in the series anyway. So it is likely, I will begin my journey in reading Matthew Corbett when I hear some news regarding the approximate or final publication date of the last volume in the Matthew Corbett series. If I can wait that long. But for now, for Boy's Life and Swan Song that I absolutely loved, let me end this review by saying thank you so much, Robert McCammon. Bravo, and thank you so much for writing these books.
“Even the most worthless thing in the world can be beautiful… it just takes the right touch.”

2010: Odyssey Two;Arthur C. Clarke;1982;1980;320;3.95;58237;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Space', 'Novels', 'Fantasy'];When 2001: A Space Odyssey first shocked, amazed, and delighted millions in the late 1960s, the novel was quickly recognized as a classic. Since then, its fame has grown steadily among the multitudes who have read the novel or seen the film based on it. Yet, along with almost universal acclaim, a host of questions has grown more insistent through the years:Who or what transformed Dave Bowman into the Star-Child? What purpose lay behind the transformation? What would become of the Star-Child?What alien purpose lay behind the monoliths on the Moon and out in space?What could drive HAL, a stable, intelligent computer, to kill the crew? Was HAL really insane? What happened to HAL and the spaceship Discovery after Dave Bowman disappeared?Would there be a sequel?Now all those questions and many more have been answered. In this stunning sequel to his international bestseller, Clarke has written what will truly be one of the great books of the '80s. Cosmic in sweep, eloquent in its depiction of Man's place in the Universe, and filled with the romance of space, this novel is a monumental achievement.;"The second part was produced after the first volume of a series simultaneously as one of the most beautiful films by Stanley Kubrick. It projected us in 2010, ten years after the disappearance of Discovery and the astronauts Dave Bowman and Frank Poole.In addition to continuing a fascinating story and extending Kubrick's remarkable film, this section allows you to deepen the notions developed in the first volume and explain more. This famous last sequence, ""Beyond the Stargate,"" has given rise to many comments.We find Professor Heywood Floyd on the outskirts of Jupiter and its moons, whose mysterious Europe holds many secrets to come.This novel is a beautiful companion for those who want to travel in the solar system with an exceptionally engaging and fluid reading.This text takes on a credible dimension with scientific data inspired by reality. There are even inventions there that will be used years after their writing.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70539.2010
Count Zero;William Gibson;1986;1980;308;4.02;55484;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Novels', 'Fantasy'];William Gibson continues the visionary Sprawl Trilogy that began with Neuromancer in this frighteningly probable parable of the future.A corporate mercenary wakes in a reconstructed body, a beautiful woman by his side. Then Hosaka Corporation reactivates him, for a mission more dangerous than the one he’s recovering to get a defecting chief of R&D—and the biochip he’s perfected—out intact. But this proves to be of supreme interest to certain other parties—some of whom aren’t remotely human....;The coolest thing about reading Gibson is jacking in to his urbane and hip way of descriptive narration.William Gibson, as prophet of cyber punk and also as the herald of his later Blue Ant works, returns to The Sprawl for a continuation of the setting he began in his masterwork, Neuromancer.But like many of his books, this sequel is only that in regard to a return to the original setting, Count Zero works as a stand alone. The Sprawl, the megalopolis formed by the Eastern United States, from Boston to Atlanta, is his futuristic, over population setting where artificial intelligence spooks the Matrix, where cowboy hackers can jack into cyberspace and where corporate mercenaries compete in clandestine adventures.Gibson also demonstrates his remarkable skill at depicting corporate espionage amidst an anarcho-capitalistic world dominated by multi-national corporations. Count Zero also explores the results of unrestrained individual wealth in a global economy and wealth as an analog for a new aristocracy as corporations melded into capitalistic clans. The super rich are not even human, so far removed from ordinary circumstances and from the constraints of mortality.Gibson’s Sprawl trilogy (completed in 1988 with Mona Lisa Overdrive) bridges the cyberpunk genre from the release of Bladerunner to the beginning of The Matrix films and is the cornerstone of this sub-genre.*** 2022 rearead – Neuromancer is one of my all-time favorite books, I love it.But after re-reading the 1986 “sequel” I will join many other reviewers in stating that Count Zero is actually the better written novel.I still love Neuromancer, still one of my all-time favs – it is raw and energetic like the garage band origins of a great rock show. Count Zero is from a writer with some street cred, a little more polished, a little more intricacy and with some more diesel in the tank.A sequel in that it is in the same “Sprawl” universe and shares with its predecessor some of the same cyberspace themes, this also made me think of the review that describes Gibson’s writing as “high tech – low life”. This is crime writing hardwired and jacked in.Speaking of crime writing, let me here emphasize and highlight a great character who was also in Neuromancer and is apparently also in the third book, Mona Lisa Overdrive. I’m talking about The Finn. In crime literature parlance, the Fence is where the rubber meets the road. This is the bridge between the shady underworld of crime and the “respectable” market. Think of Dickens’ Fagan and you know that you’ve got to have a good fence in the lineup. The Finn is all that and a bag of chips – bio chips that is.Great fun, I’m upping this to 4 stars and on to Mona Lisa Overdrive.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22200.Count_Zero

The Robots of Dawn;Isaac Asimov;1983;1980;438;4.19;50862;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Robots', 'Classics', 'Audiobook'];A millennium into the future two advances have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the Galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain. Isaac Asimov's Robot novels chronicle the unlikely partnership between a New York City detective and a humanoid robot who must learn to work together.Detective Elijah Baley is called to the Spacer world Aurora to solve a bizarre case of roboticide. The prime suspect is a gifted roboticist who had the means, the motive, and the opportunity to commit the crime. There's only one catch: Baley and his positronic partner, R. Daneel Olivaw, must prove the man innocent. For in a case of political intrigue and love between woman and robot gone tragically wrong, there's more at stake than simple justice. This time Baley's career, his life, and Earth's right to pioneer the Galaxy lie in the delicate balance.;"The Robots of Dawn (Robot #3), Isaac AsimovThe Robots of Dawn is a ""whodunit"" science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, first published in 1983. It is the third novel in Asimov's Robot series. Detective Elijah Baley of Earth is training with his son and others to overcome their socially ingrained agoraphobia when he is told that the Spacer world of Aurora has requested him to investigate a crime: the destruction of the mind of R. Jander Panell, a humaniform robot identical to R. Daneel Olivaw, with a mental block. The robot's inventor, Han Fastolfe, has admitted that he is the only person with the skill to have done this, but denies having done it. Fastolfe is also a prominent member of the Auroran political faction that favors Earth; wherefore, it is politically expedient that he be exonerated. En route to Aurora, Baley again is partnered with R. Daneel Olivaw, and introduced to R. Giskard Reventlov, a robot of an earlier model. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه آگوست سال1995میلادیعنوان: روباتهای سپیده دم؛ آیزاک آسیموف؛ مترجم: هروس شبانی؛ تهران، شقایق، سال1376، در576ص؛ داستانهای علمی تخیلی؛ دنباله ی داستانهای غارهای پولادی و خورشید عریان موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان روس تبار ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده20مکتاب «روباتهای سپیده دم»، ادامه ای بر کتابهای «غارهای پولادی»، و «خورشید عریان» است؛ باز هم قتلی رخ داده، به عبارت بهتر، یک ربات کُشی رخ داده است، باز هم کاراگاه «الیاس بیلی»، که اینک بواسطه ی یک فیلمِِ بین سیاره ای (که در مورد ماجرای او در سیاره «سولاریا»، و پرونده ی قتل یک «سولاریایی»، و گشودن آن پرونده) ساخته شده، بسیار نام آشنا شده اند، باز هم برای بررسی و پژوهش فراخوانده میشوند؛ اما ناخواسته، مسئولیت بسیار سنگینی، به اندازه ی همه ی سیاره ی زمین نیز، در این ماجرا، بر دوش ایشان گذاشته میشود؛ اگر در حل این رخداد پیروز نشود، به زیان همه ی ساکنین زمین، و بیشتر از همه، خود او تمام خواهد شد؛ و در صورت پیروزی، علاوه بر شهرت، و اعتبار بیشتر، آینده ی زمین، و فرزندانش، و فرزند خود او نیز، با مهاجرت به سیارات تازه، تامین خواهد بود؛ و از زمین، و از بند «غارهای عظیم پولادی»، رها خواهند شد، به آفتاب سلامی دوباره خواهند داد، و همانند هزار سال پیش، دل به پهنه ی کهکشان، خواهند سپرد، و سیارات قابل سکونت خواهند یافت، و مهاجرنشینان تازه تشکیل خواهند داد و ...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 01/12/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 22/10/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41810.The_Robots_of_Dawn
Mona Lisa Overdrive;William Gibson;1988;1980;312;4.01;45067;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction'];William Gibson, author of the extraordinary multiaward-winning novel Neuromancer, has written his most brilliant and thrilling work to date... The Mona Lisa Overdrive. Enter Gibson's unique world - lyric and mechanical, erotic and violent, sobering and exciting - where multinational corporations and high tech outlaws vie for power, traveling into the computer-generated universe known as cyberspace. Into this world comes Mona, a young girl with a murky past and an uncertain future whose life is on a collision course with internationally famous Sense/Net star Angie Mitchell. Since childhood, Angie has been able to tap into cyberspace without a computer. Now, from inside cyberspace, a kidnapping plot is masterminded by a phantom entity who has plans for Mona, Angie, and all humanity, plans that cannot be controlled... or even known. And behind the intrigue lurks the shadowy Yakuza, the powerful Japanese underworld, whose leaders ruthlessly manipulate people and events to suit their own purposes... or so they think.;"I love the way William Gibson writes. If I could imagine and set down the kind of books I want to read, his would be as near to the mark as possible.Gibson is the literary heir to Philip K. Dick’s homey futurism – his is the messenger, the rent-a-cop, the retail appliance repairman in the grimy but tech advanced future – our blue collar, street wise guide to the mesmerizing world building.Gibson’s 1988 conclusion to his groundbreaking Sprawl trilogy was a demonstration of some of his best writing. What began in the epochal Neuromancer, the Sprawl – that confluence of all the major urban centers on the United States east coast, from Boston to Atlanta – is a setting that provides Gibson’s able mind and extraordinary talent to describe for us a dystopian cyberpunk landscape that has influenced SF writing ever since.In this novel we see a return of Molly Millions (though she is semi-retired and operating under a different alias) and a seamy tangle of interests involving organized crime, near future state of the market tech, drugs and biotech, corporate espionage, capitalistic anarchy and all rolled up in the neo-noir setting that has become Gibson’s trademark.And his exceptional writing.“The world hadn’t ever had so many moving parts or so few labels.”“This was nothing like Tokyo, where the past, all that remained of it, was nurtured with a nervous care. History there had become a quantity, a rare thing, parceled out by government and preserved by law and corporate funding. Here it seemed the very fabric of things, as if the city were a single growth of stone and brick, uncounted strata of message and meaning, age upon age, generated over the centuries to the dictates of some now-all-but-unreadable DNA of commerce and empire.” “Because sometimes it feels good to shake it all off, get out from under. Chances are, we haven’t. But maybe we have. Maybe nobody, nobody at all, knows where we are. Nice feeling, huh? You could be kinked, you ever think of that? Maybe your dad, the Yak warlord, he’s got a little bug planted in you so he can keep track of his daughter. You got those pretty little teeth, maybe Daddy’s dentist tucked a little hardware in there one time when you were into a stim. You go to the dentist?” “Yes.” “You stim while he works?” “Yes …” “There you go. Maybe he’s listening to us right now.…”“And somewhere, in a black California morning, some hour before dawn, amid the corridors, the galleries, the faces of dream, fragments of conversation she half-recalled, waking to pale fog against the windows of the master bedroom, she prized something free and dragged it back through the wall of sleep. Rolling over, fumbling through a bedside drawer, finding a Porsche pen, a present from an assistant grip, she inscribed her treasure on the glossy back of an Italian fashion magazine:”Speculative fiction GOLD.*** 2022 reread - This finishes my reread of the Sprawl trilogy, Neuromancer - Count Zero - Mona Lisa Overdrive, and I'm more impressed with Gibson's work than I was before, just amazing writing.Another reviewer talked about how Gibson is able to convey not just the sights and sounds of his story but also the smells and textures as well, and this was a spot on observation. Reading Gibson's prose is like walking through a Home Depot with all the descriptive language and also a tech store. The blend of science fiction writing with crime story language and wrapped up in a realistic setting makes this so special. Future tech will also be dirty and gritty because humans will be involved and duality is what we all are, and what we're about. The two ""Angies"" helps to personify this perfectly and the twin AI from Neuromancer are back to further portray this concept.This also made me consider that Neil Gaiman may have been influenced by this in American Gods because of the AI use of voodoo personages to communicate, also depicting our deification of poorly understood tech.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154091.Mona_Lisa_Overdrive

Shards of Honour ;Lois McMaster Bujold;1986;1980;253;4.07;37920;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Romance', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];When Cordelia Naismith and her survey crew are attacked by a renegade group from Barrayar, she is taken prisoner by Aral Vorkosigan, commander of the Barrayan ship that has been taken over by an ambitious and ruthless crew member. Aral and Cordelia survive countless mishaps while their mutual admiration and even stronger feelings emerge.;"An all-time SF favorite! Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature: Shards of Honor (often packaged with Barrayar and sold as Cordelia's Honor) is one of those SF space opera books that I love beyond reason and pull off my bookshelf every few years to reread, contentedly immersing myself in Bujold’s well-imagined world and the relationship between two characters I adore.A bit of background: I started my VORKOSIGAN SAGA experience years ago when I grabbed A Civil Campaign off the library shelves, and was introduced to the very short, brilliant, terrifyingly competent and wildly adventurous Miles Vorkosigan. Though I didn’t realize it at the time, that book was not the best place to start with this series; it assumes a lot of background knowledge about the characters and events in their lives and really isn’t characteristic of the series, with its focus on romance and social satire over adventure. I was a little mystified but interested enough to check out more books in this series from the library.And eventually I ended up here, with Shards of Honor, and Cordelia Naismith and Aral Vorkosigan’s first meeting. She’s the Betan captain of a surveying team exploring an uninhabited (she thinks) planet; he’s the commander of a Barrayaran military outpost on that planet. (Beta is extremely socially progressive; Barrayar has a rigid, traditional and militaristic society.) Their groups clash in a deadly meeting, and Aral and Cordelia are abandoned among the dead and wounded. They need to cooperate to survive. As they trek to Aral’s camp, running into deadly alien animals along the way and surviving on scanty rations, they gain respect for each other, and love starts to develop. Cordelia is loyal to Beta, however, and more, she can’t imagine living and raising a family in the paternalistic society of Barrayar. That and the conflict between their worlds pull her and Aral apart.I totally fell in love with these two characters and their adventures, a mix of political intrigue and battles, both in space and on land, and between individuals as well as societies. Cordelia’s and Aral’s unusual romance went straight to my heart, and their respective moral dilemmas were heartrending. Shards of Honor might not be the best book in the VORKOSIGAN SAGA, but it’s the one most beloved by me.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61903.Shards_of_Honour

And for good reason, Brin is a good writer and backs up his prose with real science.More than just a Road Warrior after civilization story, Brin explores themes of the frailty of civil society, but also the perseverance of that same community and the importance of belief in tradition and national identity.A survivor dons an old postal inspector uniform and becomes the personification of a lost ideal. The red-white-and-blue shoulder insignia means something to these fighters, and to those too young to remember the United States, he becomes symbol of lost idealism. Brin adeptly blends with this concept a heaping side order of irony and good storytelling to make this a memorable read with lots of good quotes.Not perfect, this could also be fragmented and with inconsistent pacing; but still good speculative fiction.I’ll read more from Brin.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/889284.The_Postman

The Terran exploration vessel Streaker has crashed in the uncharted water world of Kithrup, bearing one of the most important discoveries in galactic history. Below, a handful of her human and dolphin crew battles armed rebellion and a hostile planet to safeguard her secret—the fate of the Progenitors, the fabled First Race who seeded wisdom throughout the stars.";"Re-Read 11/20/22:The kids are alright. Or rather, the Wolflings. Sure, a bit of atavistic regression, but damn, what a pressure cooker they’re under. :)Honestly, I’m still amazed at how well this book holds up. I mean, across the board, it’s so intelligent, overflowing with alien species, great worldbuilding, amazing subtext on galactic-level slavery and racism, and above all… it’s deeply, deeply fascinating. I must have read this 6 or 7 times now and I’m always shocked at how rich it is, from the dolphin goddess to the blind idiot chimp scientist, to the great friendship from the young mel and fin to Gillian and Orley to our tragic dolphin captain.It feels so personal to me, so rich, and endlessly enriching. As I keep reading this, I keep building upon it in my own imagination. It never really ends. This is a sign of a true classic.Now if only James Cameron or someone with his talent and bankroll could turn THIS book into a movie. THAT would be something for the ages. :)Original Review:I've been reading this book over the decades and I can still honestly say that it's both timely and timeless in its ideas, its story, and its characters. That's even taking into account that most SF eventually dates itself or becomes a humorous example of just how much we all eventually learn.This one doesn't suffer at all. Since the eighties this still remains a mind-blowing and fantastic space opera of the kind I still have yet compare anything else as favorably. Even among Brin's other Uplift novels.It's simple, really. It's a chase novel. The particulars, however, are wildly divergent from anything else I've ever read. Uplifted dolphin crew with a chimp geologist and a handful of humans made an accidental discovery of galactic proportions and after sending a brief description of fifty world-sized ancient spaceships belonging to the first galactic race to have begun the uplift process for the many, many alien races filling the galaxy to the brim, Earth replies, ""Oh Shit. Run. Run!"" All the races have their own legends about the progenitors and their eventual return, and most of the vilest are religious fanatics that warp reality or cruelly alter genetics of their subordinate races to atrocious effect. And since they picked up on this little tidbit, they're ALL after the humans. Besieging Earth, all our colonies, and sending the weight of entire armies after the poor hapless dolphin crew.What an epic setup, and this is where the novel begins. :)They've already escaped a few close calls but crash land on a fallow world and pray that the battling aliens in the system above wipe each other out. And in the meantime, we've got great dolphin and human characters and one asshole geologist who may or may not be redeemable, assuming we take away his mini atom bombs and tell him he may NOT study the new planet's structure while they're trying to hide from the galactic crazies. :) There's so much to say about this novel and so many great things happen, but I do want to mention a few things. The whale songs and the poetry of the hybrid human/dolphin speech: It's all poetry. How often do we get poetry in our space operas? :) We've got serious ideas about uplfting our earthly relatives, too. Even dogs are on the docket. The dolphins have waldos for delicate work with arms and fingers. Mr. Dart may climb trees, but he's from a widely respected school. And the captain of the Streaker is a really brilliant dolphin. I feel the most sorry for what happens to him.The action in this tale may be as small as simple survival on a rough world, the reveals about the strange state of this planet or the creatures living there, or even a great deal of action breaking down the basic decency of some of the dolphin crew until they revert to a slightly less civilized state. Or we could focus on the big action with spaceships blowing up and crashing into the planet. Either way, the novel is great on all levels.It's stood the test of time, being a great tale with great characters, fantastic language and conflicts, and especially an absolutely amazing amount of beautiful world (or galaxy) building. :)I always thought of this one as the gold standard for all big-idea and action SF. And it still is.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234501.Startide_Rising

VALIS;Philip K. Dick;1981;1980;242;3.92;30605;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Novels', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy'];"VALIS is the first book in Philip K. Dick's incomparable final trio of novels (the others being The Divine Invasion and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer). This disorienting and bleakly funny work is about a schizophrenic hero named Horselover Fat; the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity; and reality as revealed through a pink laser. VALIS is a theological detective story, in which God is both a missing person and the perpetrator of the ultimate crime.";"Imagine taking a walk in a bad neighborhood and sitting on a sidewalk bench. Beside you sits a disheveled homeless person with crazy eyes. Despite your best efforts the two of you strike up a conversation. Slowly, incredulously, you begin to realize that this crazy person is well read. No, this person is educated, well educated and though he goes off on wild tangents and makes seemingly ludicrous claims, his mind is a brilliantly tangled mess, a fecundity of original thought. And yet all the while the crazy eyes continue to make you uncomfortable. This is a fitting illustration of reading VALIS by Philip K. Dick. Narrated by the author and yet telling the tale of Horselover Fat (a pseudonym for Dick himself) and yet with allusions that Fat is himself (and a direct reference to David Bowie!) and only written in the third person to make a better story. VALIS is a theological, philosophical, sociological funhouse ride. Is Dick really a self-medicated schizophrenic? Does he affect this perspective to tell the story? Is the perspective an unguarded glimpse at mental illness; is this a literary affectation for effect? VALIS may be his best novel or his most unstable, or both, it grips the reader and holds tight and all the while the reader is held like a rubber-necking motorist slowly passing a wreck. But is the wreck real or a cleverly crafted performance art? It all goes towards the brilliance of the book. The cameo appearance by David Bowie was very cool, that conversation can easily be imagined. Clearly well researched, Dick’s eclectic litany of abstract and unorthodox ideas are reminiscent of Kesey or H.P. Lovecraft. VALIS represents the literary culmination of much of his research that readers can find in the The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick. If you don’t like PKD as a writer, don’t bother, but if you like his writing, this one is a must read.*** 2023 reread - Imagine the room - a late 70s den or rec room, kitschy posters, albums, paperback books scattered, the detritus of a concluding decade collected in half hazard, neglected design. This is the not the sanctuary of a worldly person, supine here is an intellect not long for this world but who is a canary in a coal mine, here is a sensitive artist who is tuned into the narrow bandwidth of a time and place, his knowing fingers on the pulse of this age in our experience.The author of books about androids and simulacra has here written one of his most knowing books about dehumanization and the trends in our western civilization away from God. But! This is, after all, Philip K. Dick and things are not exactly as they seem; the thick leather reins are in fact dry rubber bands and these horses will get out of our control early on and gallop off into a left field of spirituality, gnosticism, and theological speculation.And aliens, and God, and laser beams filled with astral intelligence, and David Bowie.Where’s my tin foil hat?Much of this highlights Phil’s strange 1974 epiphany revolving around a first century connection to our world. Fans who want to venture down that rabbit hole can spend all the time they want with Phil’s Exegesis. One criticism of this work is the lengthy and meandering musings early on about Phil’s unorthodox ideas about God. This may lose many readers, but a true fan will get cozy with Phil’s weirdness, wrapping up in the blanket of his strange theories and just have fun with it.And this book is fun, I was reminded this time around at how funny this book can be. This is not a comedy, rather Phil’s humor, dry and deadpan as it is, can be seen page after page especially in the later chapters.Also noteworthy is the tension between Phil and Horselover Fat. Wait, you say, aren’t they the same person? YES!And that is part of the gonzo charm of this 1981 publication, one of last published in his lifetime (Phil died at age 53 in 1982). It’s wild and postmodern, and chaotic, and thought provoking and … great. But maybe just for fans.I have decided that A Scanner Darkly is his masterpiece but this one may be my favorite of his.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216377.VALIS
Friday;Robert A. Heinlein;1982;1980;384;3.85;29639;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook'];"Friday is a secret courier. She is employed by a man known to her only as ""Boss."" Operating from and over a near-future Earth, in which North America has become Balkanized into dozens of independent states, where culture has become bizarrely vulgarized and chaos is the happy norm, she finds herself on shuttlecock assignment at Boss' seemingly whimsical behest. From New Zealand to Canada, from one to another of the new states of America's disunion, she keeps her balance nimbly with quick, expeditious solutions to one calamity and scrape after another.";"Robert Anson Heinlein…shame on you, sir. W…T…everwomanhating…F were you thinking when you wrote this drivel? Friday is, in my irritated opinion, the most offensive and childishly ridiculous female protagonist since Russ Meyer and Roger Corman teamed up to co-direct Planet of the Nympho Bimbos Part II: Attack of the Soapy Breast Monsters.** ** Not a real film, so don’t bother searching Amazon for it. Pardon my soap boxing, but this is a despicable pile of misogynistic shit that should have been dropped, wiped away and flushed from the literary world before it ever plopped on the printing press. Sorry for the dysphemism, but “I really didn’t like it” just doesn’t adequately express my loathe-on for this book. Previously, I’d read and enjoyed a handful of Robert Heinlein’s novels and many of his short stories and considered myself a fan of his work. I have also read some reviews where people took issue with his attitudes on sex and women, but hadn’t personally come across anything I found excessively off-putting…UNTIL NOW. This noxious crap pissed me off the roof of the RAH Fan club and had me losing respect for the man all the way down. Before I get to my major problems with the book, let me pause, slow my heart rate and give you a quick run down of the plot:
PLOT SUMMARY
Set in the future on a balkanized Earth that has splintered into a collection of rival city-states, corporate fiefdoms and criminal enclaves, Friday Baldwin is an artificial person (AP) who works as a combat courier for a mysterious employer. Her job is making deliveries and pick ups to sensitive to be entrusted to normal channels. As an AP, she is stronger, faster and supposedly more intelligent than normal humans though she hides her true nature because APs are held in contempt by society (similar to Robots in Asimov’s much better Robot novels). Early on in the book Friday finds herself out of a job and then travels from situation to situation acting as the reader’s eyes and ears for Heinlein to share with us his vision of a dystopic future and expound on his political views. Of the almost 400 pages in the book, there’s about 100 or so that are decent, Heinlein world building. 
MY PROBLEMS WITH THIS BOOK
For all of her strength, speed and deadly fighting ability, Friday is nothing more than an insecure, bubble-headed skank who thinks that SEX is the only valuable commodity she has to offer in this world. Countless times in the book, she either sleeps with, or tells the reader she would be willing to sleep with, someone as nothing more than a courteous “thank you” for being nice. Don’t get me wrong, sexual independence and equality…fine by me. But I got no inkling in Heinlein’s prose of sex being an uninhibited display of physicality between equals free to express themselves. Nope, didn’t see it. I saw tawdry, lowbrow objectification grounded in atavistic chauvinism rather than new age “free loveism.” Granted, most of the sex Friday has in the book is consensual and she’s a willing participant. I say “most” because there’s an instance at the beginning of the book when Friday is kidnapped and gang-raped by 4 guys (I’m not kidding folks). Of course, Friday, for the most part, doesn’t hold a grudge against the rapists as she believes they are just “softening” her up for interrogation which she completely understands. Whoa…full stop…major HUH? Moment ahead. Excuse me while I bang my head against the wall in frustration. As a proud: 1. Father of two brilliant, happy and outgoing little girls, 2. Husband of a smart, confident, self-motivated woman,3. Younger brother of two well-educated, independent sisters, and 4. Youngest son of an intelligent, successful businesswoman (and mom of 5)……I just wanted to bitch-slap Heinlein until I knocked the skeevy right out of him. Please don’t interpret this as some indulgent display of gender enlightenment by the PC police as I am about as opposed to militant PCness as I am about this book. Hell, the women I know can more than take care of themselves without my blundering around getting in the way. However, this book is horrible. It’s crap and I don’t want to avoid calling it what it is simply at the risk of appearing to pander. There were dozens of instances in the book where I wanted to throw the book (with Heinlein attached) against the wall, but I’m going to mention just three of them to give you an idea of our protagonist. 1. A young man offers Friday his seat on a crowded passenger train. She accepts and then proceeds to lean forward as he stands next to her so as to allow him to look down her shirt. She does this as a gesture of thanks. 2. Friday explains her belief that it is inappropriate for her to allow someone to buy her a meal unless she is willing to give them a legitimate shot at sleeping with her. Now that’s class. 3. I don’t want to give away a spoiler so let me just tease you by saying that one of the 4 rapists from the beginning of the book reappears later in the novel and Friday’s interaction with him will cause you to fume, spit blood and hack up bile….TRUST ME ON THIS. This is not some strong, independent woman who isn’t afraid of her sexuality and explores it with confidence and on her own terms. This is a timid, naïve woman with a massive inferiority complex who feels she “owes” a guy the opportunity of getting her into her pants because he offered her his seat on a passenger train. Are you F@#KING kidding me? This book was a big, hairy Neanderthal of a novel with its knuckles dragging along the floor and had more in common with the soft-core porn of John Norman’s Gor novels than the previous work I’ve read by Mr. Heinlein.A horrible, massive disappointment and it will be a while before I give one of his books my time. For now, Mr. Heinlein, let me just say:";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17208.Friday
Eon;Greg Bear;1985;1980;504;3.88;29211;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Speculative Fiction'];"The 21st century was on the brink of nuclear confrontation when the 300 kilometer-long stone flashed out of nothingness and into Earth's orbit. NASA, NATO, and the UN sent explorers to the asteroid's surface...and discovered marvels and mysteries to drive researchers mad.For the Stone was from space--but perhaps not our space; it came from the future-but perhaps not our future; and within the hollowed asteroid was Thistledown. The remains of a vanished civilization. A human--English, Russian, and Chinese-speaking--civilization. Seven vast chambers containing forests, lakes, rivers, hanging cities...And museums describing the Death; the catastrophic war that was about to occur; the horror and the long winter that would follow. But while scientists and politicians bickered about how to use the information to stop the Death, the Stone yielded a secret that made even Earth's survival pale into insignificance.";Review – ReduxThere should be a picture of Eon in the dictionary: right next to “Sense-of-wonder-SF”.Reading this book was like listening to a complicated symphony. Eon opens as a near future artifact, or big-dumb-object, tale largely inspired by Rendezvous With Rama. The novel then progresses through a number of movements, each more mind-numbing and awe-inspiring than the previous. It is therefore no great surprise that the book eventually evolves (or devolves, depending on your point of view) from Hard Science Fiction to a form of Space Opera. Then, of course, there is the grand finale, which is really something else. Like the early Uplift novels by David Brin Eon seems to be a bridge between old school and the new as far as Science Fiction is concerned. I am by no means a buff. Anyway, I really enjoyed the novel. It embodies what I have come to love about Sci-Fi. There was a lot about the novel I didn't understand at all, but I was awed. Another work I was reminded of while reading this was Ringworld (Larry Niven). It was a challenge to envision what I was reading, but getting there is part of the thrill.Despite the dated cold war politics, which seems to be a grievance to some reviewers, this book did not seem dated at all. Considering the alternate universes and time-lines being casually tossed about here, that kind of thing shouldn’t even be an issue. The focus did shift unexpectedly between characters from time to time, but I felt that this was in tune with the way the novel was constructed. Each new discovery leads to a new focus, until the discoveries spiral out of control and the reader is left breathless and stunned.A novel as ambitious and complicated as this is bound to draw negative criticism. I would never expect different. However, I would urge you to form your own opinion. So, if you enjoy artifacts in Science Fiction, this is mandatory reading. I have to agree with another reviewer - there are moments when you have to put the book down and just stare into space, assimilating. This is an experience, not a read.RecommendedFavourites;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840278.Eon

I have been remiss in not picking it up sooner and I am repenting. By reading it a book a week with my friends ☺!I was already in love with the Count and Countess Vorkosigan and I should have known that their progeny would not disappoint either. After all, Miles Vorkosigan is a combination of their genetic material complimented by the influence of their character and upbringing. He should be perfect.... And he is, in ways that truly matter, but neither he nor others see it that way. Miles is smart, charming, born to high nobility, privileged, and is even in line for the Imperial throne. He is well taken care of, had a happy childhood and parents who love and respect him. But despite all of that, Miles is pitied and excluded by most, finding himself always on the outside looking in... Because when Cordelia was several months pregnant with him, a political enemy of her husband's poisoned her and the baby, the poison destroying the newly forming bones. Only a miracle of medical science and an experimental testing kept Miles alive and gave him a chance to grow. The growth was extremely painful and despite the constant surgeries and top care, Miles is deformed, undergrown, and his bones break all the time, even by just a firm grip or a forceful step. Despite the constant physical suffering, Miles has a great personality and a bright outlook on life, never giving up or falling under depression or outside negativity. His sharp mind and photographic memory serve him well in all situations, particularly at the times he decides to throw himself into adventure. Being the son of a Count, Miles is given a chance at trying out for the Imperial Military Academy but fails fast and decisively. He returns home morally defeated and in order to give him something to do, his parents send him, his bodyguard's daughter Elena Bothari and the giant Sargent B. to visit his grandmother in Beta Colony for a vacation. Miles is secretly in love with Elena and wants to help her discover more about her mother, hoping this will make her love him too. Things don't go as planned, since at the moment they reach Beta Colony, Miles finds himself the owner of a junk Freight spaceship and a liege Lord to its jump pilot. In order to pay for the ship he takes on some dangerous cargo and gets himself and his friends involved in a war... One thing leads to another and at one point Miles is feet deep in complex issues, having to worry not only about his own life, but being responsible for the lives and payroll of many, many more... The boy has FORWARD MOMENTUM, brains and balls!!!! The situations he falls into are so unlikely, but Miles character is such that you can't help but accept and root for the cause!!! There is some romance, one very difficult scene with Bothari and his daughter's mother, which just broke my ❤ for all involved, and some romantic disappointment. There was a ton of character development and still our protagonist is given plenty of space to grow. The writing is delightful and the plot has the pacing of a fast developing adventure. I was glued to it from beginning to end and was won over by the flowing storytelling and surprisingly touching details, which made the tale relatable and enjoyable. I would recommend it to everyone, no matter of genre preference! Now I wish you all Happy Reading and may you always find what you need between the pages of a good book!!!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61906.The_Warrior_s_Apprentice

This review will probably make better sense if you’ve read that.https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...For those of you who are too lazy to read and/or have a bizarre fear of clicking, I liked the first book. It's a very lean, tight piece of what I'd consider ""Classical hard sci-fi"" by which I mean there's a focus on the science, and an emphasis of plot over character.This sequel was written more than 15 years later in collaboration with a different author: Gentry Lee. From what I've gathered, I think it's safe to say that Clarke provided some ideas for this sequel, while Lee is the one who actually wrote the book.What went wrong:Ultimately, everything that made me dislike this book stems from the fact that it’s a sequel to Rendezvous with Rama. 1. Enormous stylistic shift from the first book.This book was much longer (more than twice as long) and much more descriptive than the first book. The structure itself was much more meandering, and non-linear. Now I don't mean to say that Gentry's writing is unpleasant. Honestly, his style is much more like mine than Clarke's is. So I can't throw stones.The problem is that it’s almost the opposite of everything Clarke did in the first book. Clarke’s description is lean to the point of austerity. And as I mentioned in my previous review, Clarke’s pacing and structure is so tight that it almost doesn’t allow room for tension. (Almost). The result is that this sequel doesn’t just feel entirely different. (Which would be a big enough issue by itself) it’s that when held up against the first book, this one feels huge, loose, ponderous, and slow. 2. Huge shift in tone. In the first book, Clark tells a story of humanity coming together and working against incredible odds to investigate a mystery. And by extension, improve the sum total of human knowledge.It’s true that some people in the book react with fear, but wiser heads prevail. The story was optimistic and full of heroes. This makes it a book that’s hopeful about the future of humanity. In the sequel, pretty much everyone is a bastard, by which I mean they’re motivated by self-interest. There are a few people that stand up to them… but that leads to an entirely different kind of story. A world where everyone’s a bastard except for 3 people isn’t an optimistic book. The other huge change in character deals with the cleverness of the characters. In the first book, the characters are really clever. When investigating the alien ship, the Astronauts move with great deliberation and forethought. They’re painfully aware of the fact that they don’t know what’s going on. They treat the alien ship with reverence, and are careful… well… not to be total dickbags when interacting with the ship. For example, when investigating the ship, they talk about cutting through walls so they can see the inner working of the ship or the contents of some of the structures…. But then they don’t, because they realize that that could be viewed as aggressive by the ship (Which has shown itself to be automated.) Also, when they encounter creatures on the ship, they decide *not* to try and capture and/or kill them. Because again, that would probably be seen as aggressive/destructive. In the sequel, when they get onto the ship, almost the very *first* thing they do is try to attack/capture one of the creatures they see. And when it goes wrong a lot of the folks are like, “Holy shit, who ever thought it would come to this?!?” Well, everyone who read the first book, I’m guessing. And probably anyone who wasn’t a total self-interested bastard, too. 3. Huge focal shift from the first book. The first book of the series was focused primarily on the ship itself. There were was some backstory to the world, and there was some information on the characters, too. But all of that was in service to the center of the story, which was about the aliens and the mystery of their ship.The sequel focuses on the characters themselves. There are twice as many, and nearly every character is a POV character at some point. And they all have backstories. And flashbacks. And ulterior motives that have nothing to do with unraveling the mystery of the ship.The odd thing is that I actually *like* this kind of book more. Character stuff is my bread and butter. But that's not why I started reading this book. I started reading this book for answers to the mysteries that were brought up in the first book. But honestly? This book kinda didn't give a shit about the previously established mysteries at all.And if you think I'm just being pissy, consider this:The original Rama was 243 pages long. But in this second book, the crew doesn't even get to the ship until page 170 or so. But ultimately, here's the real dealbreaker for me.... 4. It turns out Clarke wrote Rendezvous with Rama as a stand-alone novel.He mentioned this in his introduction. And when I read that piece of information, my initial reaction was genuine anger and disgust. As the opening to a three-part series that slowly unravels mysteries about a spaceship(s) and the alien race that created it, Rendezvous with Rama was a great book. But as a stand alone novel it has all the appeal of half a hand job. Half *dry* hand job. By a dumpster behind gas station. Now this might seem a little harsh. But it really isn't. There's an enormous difference between a story that doesn't give you all the answers (either because of subtlety in the storytelling or because the answers will be coming in future books) and a story that has no answers to give. The main difference is that the latter story is utter bullshit. This is what I mean when I said this book disappointed me from before the first page. What I found out in the introduction to this book actually made revise my opinion of the previous book, and lose respect for Clarke as an author. I’d assumed he was teasing us with a mystery. I’d assumed he had answers he was going to give us eventually.But he didn't. And that is a betrayal of trust. It makes me go back and resent the book that I'd previously enjoyed. It actually makes me want to go back in and change my rating of the book here on goodreads. (And I may. I'm not sure...)This is also what I was referring to when I mentioned that this book is my worst nightmare. It's proof that a sequel can be more than a disappointment. It can retroactively ruin a book you had previously enjoyed. And yeah. That's a spooky thing to me. And it lets me know that I'm right to be careful with my own sequels.I actually bought the third book of the series. But I'm not going to read it. It's a rare thing for me to give up on a series like this. But I feel ill-used by Clarke. And there are many other books to read....";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112520.Rama_II
The Uplift War;David Brin;1987;1980;638;4.07;26817;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Hugo Awards', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Aliens'];"David Brin's Uplift novels are among the most thrilling and extraordinary science fiction ever written. Sundiver, Startide Rising,  and The Uplift War--a New York Times bestseller--together make up one of the most beloved sagas of all time. Brin's tales are set in a future universe in which no species can reach sentience without being ""uplifted"" by a patron race. But the greatest mystery of all remains unsolved: who uplifted humankind?As galactic armadas clash in quest of the ancient fleet of the Progenitors, a brutal alien race seizes the dying planet of Garth. The various uplifted inhabitants of Garth must battle their overlords or face ultimate extinction. At stake is the existence of Terran society and Earth, and the fate of the entire Five Galaxies. Sweeping, brilliantly crafted, inventive and dramatic, The Uplift War is an unforgettable story of adventure and wonder from one of today's science fiction greats.";And here we, no wrong sorry, here come the chimpanzees. There are so many Sci-Fi ideas including apes, like the Planet of the apes' franchise, cartoon characters and many evil experiments. One of the less widespread ideas is reverse engineering, the downgrading, or, appropriate to the terminology of the novels, downlifting, of humans to make hybrids. Instead of improving gorillas, chimps, orangutans, bonobos and naked mole rats to make them more human, the humans get monkeyed and not the monkey humanized. This could go immediate by any kind of wonder drug, but because this is a serious social network, let's forget about this actually still rather childish idea. It may become possible in a very far future, but the more probable approach is to exchange the human DNA parts in humans with monkey DNA and see what happens. Exactly the same as China is already doing vice versa. One must not forget that the key to understanding intelligence lies in the success of this endeavor, cause all genes for intelligence and human traits ( poor comparison) have to be found to succeed. So after finally successfully breeding a monkey-human or human-monkey hybrid the next step would be to pimp humans with the found genes for intelligence. If there are different gene types in different species of apes, why not include all of them in one human being to pimp her/him up? Being reminded of our origin and ancestors is an important mind game, cause, just like dealing with the inevitability of death, it makes us more autochthonous, self-aware and humble instead of being arrogant as a so-called crown of a still-running evolution that could bring creatures or visitors from outside that kick us from the throne. Or at least it gets easier to laugh about ourselves, naked apes that we are. I, for instance, would bet on less good gorilla and bonobo influence in my genes and more of the stylish evil chimpanzee mentality with the tendency to lunacy, but I like myself, so it is okay as long as you don´t provoke me or I have a bad day of just find beeing murderous entertaining and gather my primate buddies and come in your land to ravage it, steal your women and stuff. Just joking, we are civilized and wouldn´t do this.In such a small, direct, inefficient scale.Tropes show how literature is conceived and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234489.The_Uplift_War

But the greatest mystery of all remains unsolved. . . .“Superb”— Science Fiction Times;The most fascinating aspect of Brin's work is, next do the development of language depending on the habitat and culture of a species, the idea of uplifting. Many questions, ideas and plot possibilities come with it: Have we been uplifted? If we have been uplifted, are we living in a kind of alien zoo? Could this be part of the simulation hypothesis?Is what we do with other animals, such as breeding for thousands of years and now, the hottest new trend, genetic engineering with techniques as CRISPR, not a kind of own style of uplifting?How will we deal with the rights of species, such as wales, octopus, birds, elephants, monkeys, etc. if they develop very high intelligence naturally by evolution or with our help? How can they be integrated into a human or alien society?At which point is a species mature enough to be allowed to uplift other species?If there are different kinds of intelligence, especially with individuals or with hive minds and the uplifter has a preference or completely beliefs in the ideology of one kind of culture, what kind of assimilation is the right one to avoid destroying the culture and polluting it with foreign influences?Culture is the most difficult topic, cause the danger of Cargo Cults and directed, technical development that destroys uniqueness and creativity are ubiquitous.What about the right so stay primitive or at a certain level without further development, because the species prefers to stop all developments at a certain level that seems adequate to them? This is one of the most astonishing magic capabilities of Sci-Fi, to let the reader with more open than answered questions after finishing reading. Imagine just the sheer amount of all movie, game and literature alien species with extremely detailed culture and how many possibilities of how they might influence each other in a fictive crossover can grow out of a simple mind game.

The Cat Who Walks Through Walls;Robert A. Heinlein;1985;1980;388;3.71;23490;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery'];When a stranger attempting to deliver a cryptic message is shot dead at his table, Dr. Richard Ames is thrown headfirst into danger, intrigue, and other dimensions, where a plot to rescue a sentient computer could alter human history...;*** 2024 reread - I’m rereading all of Heinlein’s later works after having discovered that I could see them from a different angle. I had earlier dismissed much of his later books because of the over the top sexuality and for getting weird. Now I see better from where he was coming from and can now better appreciate what he was saying.A friend recently lamented how Heinlein was no longer readable to him because of Heinlein’s aggressive conservatism, which he found objectionable. I have been a fan of Bob’s work for decades and I too earlier had some problems with Heinlein’s work, but conservative?Let’s explore this. There does seem to be a frequent criticism of Heinlein’s canon for pervasive conservatism. But when we see that Heinlein, early on, featured strong female roles, people of color in protagonist roles, and was openly, satirically critical of established institutions like government, organized religion and marriage, was he really conservative? Many will point to Starship Troopers for a demonstration of his militarism, but even that revealed some satire and criticisms of an overly martial society.Anyway.First published in 1985, this would be the penultimate book published during his lifetime (he would die in 1988 at the age of 80) and gathered together many of the recurring characters from his long and storied career. This is about time travel, the multiverse, the “world as myth”, and other ubiquitous Heinlein themes and all rolled up in a mystery setting as our protagonists travel from a space station, to Luna, to space and beyond. I now like how Heinlein opened up in his later books and kind of said and did whatever he wanted, there is a devil-may-care candor to his later works. Bob was always bold and courageous in his writing, and these later books, written by a man not long for this world, perhaps revealed in him an even more uninhibited humanism that was not fully developed until his final years.*** - Original review - There is a saying that when pizza is good, it is great, and when it’s bad it’s still pretty good. This saying may also apply to RAH titles. This is not one of his greatest, but not bad either, pretty good. Heinlein's the world as myth concept, imaginative and entertaining is as good as his earlier work, even though this is a product of his later, weirder phase. The return of some older RAH characters is also fun. Books about time travel are always confusing, maybe by default (see Piers Anthony Bearing An Hourglass) and this one is no exception. This one takes a while to really get moving, but at the end of the day is goo SF. Like many of his post 1970 writings, Heinlein had taken a turn towards the bizarre, but if a reader is patient enough a good read can be had.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16685.The_Cat_Who_Walks_Through_Walls

Evgeny and I decided to read the whole series together:) It turned out to be a great decision:):):) I just closed the last page and needed to get on here and say how much I enjoyed this book! It is the first one I read by this author and now I am wondering why I never read her books before? After all, I was raised on Sci-Fi and Fantasy, this should have been in my radar long time ago! However, I think my reluctance of reading books in an unfinished series might have something to do with it. So, I end up being the last one at the party most of the time, but I say ""Better late than Never!!""!!! This book was published first in 1987 and I can recognize many of the style markers for that time, markers which I miss dearly nowadays... One in particular is the technical side of the Sci-Fi, still heavily relying on the science, rather then fantasy. Being raised by two ENGINEERS, and the way my mind seems to like to structure itself, I love the writing in which we take in consideration all physical laws as we know them and build on them, or despite of them, instead of just coming up with impossibilities which defy logic on all levels, and justified by saying ""Well, it is Fantasy, everything goes!"". Those writers tend to forget that all of us, no matter how ignorant of science itself, live in a physical world in which, no matter how much we might not like it, every action DOES have a reaction!!! Or as the Fantasy writers like to say, there is a PRICE for all magic!

Ms. BUJOLD has created a world based on scientific possibilities and has brought it and all of its inhabitants to life in a somewhat linear and minimalistic, but very powerful and enjoyable way. There are about 4-5 POV's, but the main characters is Leo, the teaching engineer, who has been brought on board of this space habitat in order to teach the very unexpected young and naive students, the Quaddies, a genetically created new species of humans, designed to function best and mostly exclusively at 0 Gravity environments. This experiment has been funded by a mega for profit corporation and is treating them as a biological tool, with no rights, no desires, feelings, or anything remotely acknowledging them as human. Thus they reserve the right to use them and discard them as they see fit, especially since the whole 25-26 year old experiment has been conducted clandestinely. In the moment I met the first Quaddie, Tony, I was in love!!! They have been raised in with a myriad of wrong ideas, but with some true caring and idealism as well. Many things they are made to do, which I found despicable and abhorrent, they did with no issues because they had not been thought they were not right... Their distance from violence and intrigues is also what makes them so lovable, loving and I was disarmed by their innocence. Contrasted to the cold-hearted calculation and pure cynicism of the company management, I wanted to cry, not only for them, but for humanity and the path we seem to be on even now, regular and ""insignificant"" humans and environment be damned!!! 
""... “Were you BORN inhuman or did you grow so by degrees?! MS, MD, PHD?” ...""
Claire and her baby were adorable, but Silver stole the show! This rebellious, but still good hearted young woman braved all the unknown challenges, as terrifying for her as they were, in order to bring on a change for her people and find herself in the process. And the nursery supervisor was the heart of all the humans in the book. Compelling indeed!

But Felix is also equipped with internal mechanisms that enable him, and his fellow soldiers, to survive battle situations that would destroy a man's mind.This is a remarkable novel of the horror, the courage, and the aftermath of combat--and how the strength of the human spirit can be the greatest armor of all.;"Part 1The story's divided into pieces and begins with Felix.He’s on a military starship orbiting a hostile planet called Banshee and about to be dropped into combat along with 10,000 fellow warriors. The invasion is similar to Normandy on D-Day, and we get our first glimpse of Felix in the mess hall the morning of the drop. He’s a little like this:A soldier vomits at the breakfast-line right in front of Felix, whose attitude’s one of and-no-fucks-were-given-that-day. He climbs into his armor. And it begins.The next 80 pages are fast. “Mazes,” “bunkers,” and “beacons” are about the most complex scenery beyond the scorching sand dunes. Bleak imagery and nightmare mark the killing ground of massive, ugly bugs that outnumber the warriors a thousand to one, and nearly everyone dies.By the end of the book, the symbolic hostility of the planet Banshee weaves a recurring theme. “Remember where you are,” Felix will say. “This is Banshee.” He is the sole survivor, and you get more insight into his character, as it’s slowly revealed that far from a one-dimensional badass, Felix is a broken soul, his desire to die barely matched by his stubborn, masochistic refusal to do so. More on this later.Part 2 begins the parallel story of Jack Crow, right in the midst of a messy prison escape. The shift is abrupt, and perspective changes to first-person. Jack Crow is a Galaxy-famous pirate and anti-hero, equal parts and A self-centered asshole with the morals of a cockroach, Crow mistakenly believes he’s the toughest man alive. And, being in a lot of trouble, he strikes a deal with a ruthless Captain mutineer (the main antagonist besides Banshee itself) to charmingly infiltrate and subvert a research colony in exchange for a ship and lots and lots of money. It's an ugly deal for the colony, and Crow begins to have second thoughts.Suffice it to say that before the finale, Jack Crow becomes: _________________________________________Part 3, melding of the stories.Against all odds, Felix has survived 20 drops. Banshee wants him dead, the gigantic aliens they fight begin to recognize him, and he is forced to watch as those around him are destroyed one by one. And yet, like some grotesque cosmic joke, Felix lives… for a while.That’s all I can say, except that I love Felix. They don’t make heroes like that anymore. He is indestructible but frail. Maybe I like him because he's what every hero should be: you, but better, and with thousands of dead aliens at his feet.ENDINGHoly shit the ending.  I will say nothing about it.Final ThoughtsPros: 1) Short2) Surreal action3) Ample badassery4) Somewhat heartrendingCons:1) Short2) Too short3) Steakley could have written a sequel.4) Why was there no sequel?5) Fuck.John Steakley died last year.

Yes, yes, as I said in my review of the previous book, I passed from the level of an objective reader to the zone of fan-girl subjectivity. I am a fan. So, take my review in the spirit in which it is intended, which is just to gush over my love for the genius of Louis McMaster Bujold and her unfailing ability to write a story full of action and intrigues, but most of all a story full of heart and charm oozing of the pages.. It has gotten to the point where if I had to choose a literary world I would like to spend time in order to feel good and emerge with some positivity from, this is the world I would choose any time! And I am not sure what makes me feel this way, because there are plenty of bad things happening and vileins running around causing trouble.. This book Miles, Quinn and Ivan all end up on old Earth at the same time. The Naismith mercenaries need a break, the heavily wounded need medical care, the ships need repair and supplies, and Miles has to get the money to do it all. Supposedly the Barrayaran Empire's ambassador should have a check for them, but that would have been to easy and Miles gets stuck at the Embassy indefinitely. It would have been OK if he didn't have to keep on playing the role of Admiral Naismith and lieutenant Vorkosigan at the same time, trying to keep his cover and not give out the information that they are really working for Barrayar. So he comes up with a story that Naismith is a clone of Vorkosigan gone rogue seven years ago... Now if only the story could stick....Of course things got complicated, of course everyone tried to kill him and the suspects were numerous. Nothing ever is easy for the little dude. He even had some semi-successful attempt at getting himself laid, but that has not been a true problem as of late, has it?:-)The story introduced a new character who I am sure we will hear from again - to good for soap opera like machinations for the author not to use it again, despite many feeling like it is a cop out plot device. I don't mind as long as we get more of our Miles and the crew!!!Once again, the moral dilemma of the hour is cloning and the effects it has on both the clone and the one cloned. What would you do if you were faced with the existence of a second you, as close to a copy as it could possibly get. Do you want to get to know them, bring them into the family, use them for parts? And as always, the author handled it graciously and with no judgement. I love this author!!!Now, to all the fans of lighter Sci-fi and adventure, I whole heatedly recommend this series!!! Try it out, I think you might be pleasantly surprised:-)I wish you all Happy Reading and may you always find what you need in the pages of a Good book!!!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/296182.Brothers_in_Arms

Rescued by a Royal  Mexican plane, they were hit by a double earthquake. From then on, as changed world followed changed world, things went from bad to worse.To Alex, all the signs increasingly pointed to Armageddon and the Day of Judgement. And Margrethe was a determined heathen. Somehow he had to bring her to a state of grace, for Heaven would be no paradise without her. But time was growing short. Somewhere, there had to be a solution to it all. And, of course, there was. But it was truly a Hell of a solution.;"Gone Where the Woodbine TwinethQuantum theory has some strange implications, one of which is the existence of parallel universes.* If physical reality does bifurcate at every quantum event, creating an infinite number of alternative realities, what happens to consciousness? Does it split as well, implying that twin minds exist in parallel but isolated states? Or does consciousness continue on a single trajectory, thus maintaining the presumed uniqueness of the individual personality? Could consciousness migrate from one trajectory to another, inhabiting perhaps several alternative worlds, or bodies, in the course of its existence? And what are the moral responsibilities of a conscious mind which finds itself in radically different social environments? These questions are important, especially if you are Heinlein’s protagonist Alex, a priggish, religious fundamentalist and racist but who still possesses enough nineteenth century pluck and grit to confront cosmic uncertainty head on.Or rather these would be important issues if Alex, the fundamentalist, had the leisure to ponder them. As it is, mostly he has enough trouble surviving from day to day. The experience of being thrust from one version of reality to another is a fact that a fundamentalist interpretation of scripture just doesn’t cover. Not unless the Christian God is as playfully sadistic as he is reportedly bloodthirsty. Perhaps the old Norse Loki, the pesky divine practical joker, is actually behind such apparent irrationality. This is the god of changing rules; just when you think you know the way the world works from a moral perspective, Loki pulls the rug out. But wait, scripture does cover even this. The story of Job in the Old Testament does, after all, describe a Loki-like Yahweh who thinks it a fine thing to move the moral goal posts as well as physical laws of his creation on a whim... or a wager. “Yahweh rolls loaded dice with His universe... to deceive His creatures,” according to Heinlein’s most reliable celestial authority, Rahab the biblical whore of Canaan. Even the material uncertainty of bifurcating quantum universes is then multiplied by the moral uncertainty that a Loki/Jehova suspends or even directs quantum effects willy nilly depending on his mood and latest conversation - a bit like an omnipotent Donald Trump, for example. This theological explanation accounts for much more than the contradictory results of quantum science. Who could expect an omnipotent deity to be constrained to maintaining the consistency of physical or moral laws? If God did not demonstrate his arbitrariness from time to time how would we, or he, know he was God?The ultimate divine lark is the long awaited Apocalypse, the Last Trump (the pun unintended by Heinlein of course), the End of Days. Turns out it’s a bureaucratic fiasco that should have been organised by Disney World rather than the archangels Gabriel and Michael. Archangels don’t know nothin’ ‘bout human needs like plumbing and sanitary facilities. As Alex realises, “A saved soul in Heaven occupies much the position of a blackamoor in Arkansas. And it's the angels who really rub your nose in it. I never met an angel I liked.” The last thing the resident angels want is a horde of wet back migrant human beings creating disorder in the heavenly precincts. So the Saved only get to ride in the back of the bus in the Divine Transportation System. Bit of a let down really, suggesting less than a strong ethic of biblical Truth In Advertising.Quite apart from the smug hostility of the natives, Heaven is a bust: no industry, so nothing creative or interesting to do; no horticulture, so no natural beauty or development; and no public libraries at all, so no intellectual stimulation. And to top it off, the others who have been saved - like for instance former wives - are not people you like to spend dinner with much less eternity. The Christian idea of the Holy Trinity, it turns out, is absolutely true. But its real function is simply to provide an audience for the Divine Jokester, a sort of in-house mutual appreciation society or Magic Circle which lives to laugh, mostly at the consternation they can cause among human beings.It’s all a scam of course, Heaven, that is. The Other Place is where you want to be: A rather nice planet with “No snakes. No cockroaches. No chiggers. No poison ivy. No tax collectors. No rats. No cancer. No preachers. Only two lawyers.” And the people you’d much rather be with. They even take American Express. The whole divine justice thing is the ultimate switcheroo, therefore. What japes! The basic motive force of the universe revealed: divine high spirits. No wonder we’re all confused, as Alex says, “On reflection. I realized that I was in exactly the same predicament as every other human being alive: We don't know who we are, or where we came from, or why we are here. My dilemma was merely fresher, not different.” And no wonder that many of us feel put upon because of, “The delusion that the whole world is a conspiracy. Only it's not a delusion.” As Alex concludes, “Paranoia is the only rational approach to a conspiracy world.” So next time you get irritated with the obstinate stupidity of a believer, just remember that they’re suffering too. Theology may provide a more coherent theory than quantum mechanics. But belief in infinite and arbitrary divine power comes at a price: profound fear of its arbitrary exercise (“Thy will be done...”). As Alex finally realizes, “A man who is happy at home doesn't lie awake nights worrying about the hereafter.”* See: https://www.space.com/32728-parallel-...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/355.Job

You should be warned however that you will be subjected to a portrayal of passionless sexual relationships with essentially no rules within a population of bland characters who lack not only faults like jealousy but also interesting qualities like enthusiasm and ambition.

Ethan of Athos;Lois McMaster Bujold;1986;1980;237;3.8;16128;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'LGBT'];On Athos, a world without women, Dr. Ethan Urquhart delivers babies from uterine replicators. But when the ovarian cultures start dwindling, he is sent abroad on a mission to replenish the planets stocks.;"Rating: 4* of fiveThe Publisher Says: The familiar old SF ""planet of women"" chestnut is reversed in the planet of Athos — an all-male planet made possible by the invention of the uterine replicator. Ethan, drawn out of his beloved Athos by a quest, finds himself an alien in more mainstream human society, and cannot help but find women disturbing aliens as well, especially the ultra-competent, ultra-beautiful Elli. Ethan of Athos is Lois McMaster Bujold's third novel. It departs from the concerns of the Vorkosigan family to explore the ramifications of advanced biotechnology, turning many a cliché on its head along the way.My Review: Athos is a terraformed planet settled about 200 years before this book takes place by a rigidly religious sect of men who refused to have any females on their planet, as they'd only cause trouble and lead men astray. To replace and grow the population, they do the job of birth the hard way, using uterine replicators to grow and birth their sons. Only sons, of course, and all bred from the ovarian cultures brought by the Founders to Athos. Which are, unsurprisingly, wearing out after 200 years. After some bad experiences with Galactic mail order brides/cultures, the Population Council decides to send an Ambassador out among Them, the scary galactics, to get new ovarian cultures.Ethan CJB-8 Urquhart, Ambassador-at-Large of Athos, is in a pickle. He's never been off his home world before, and here he is on Kline Station (a space station within a reasonable sub-light boost of several lucrative trading routes) trying to navigate a Universe where The Sink of Sin (that's girls to thee and me), in the person of Commander Elli Quinn, Kline Station native and Free Dendarii mercenary, appears to be trying to get him killed by Cetagandan crazies (Colonel Luyst Millisor and company) so the Cetagandans can retrieve something they want and Ethan has.But he doesn't know what it is.It's the process of finding out what it is that the Cetagandans want, the Dendarii need, and the Athosians have that powers this retelling of North by Northwest in space. Ethan must, for the first time in his thirty-plus years, cope with the presence of women in his personal world...an alien species to him...while learning about how the rough-and-tumble of the Galaxy's business is accomplished, deal with the end of his partnership with Janos back on Athos, find himself falling in love with the most alien possible alien man, and return to Athos with what sent him out into the Galaxy in the first place: More ovarian cultures for the Athosian Reproduction Centers. Then he can go home and return to his first love. Populating his beloved home world with new life and new possibilities.How he accomplishes these things is, well, it's fraught with danger, it's quite surprisingly open-minded of Ethan, and it's just not what this famous mil-SF series is famous for.I first read this in 1986. I was married, I had stepsons in the house, I was sure that my relationship with their mother was solid (oh boy was *I* ever wrong!), and yet the premise of a planet made up of men and only men had a lot of appeal.I was led from here to the rest of the Vorkosigan Saga, including: Barrayar, Cetaganda, Komarr, Sergyar, Beta Colony, Jackson's Whole, Lois Mcmaster Bujold, Ethan Of Athos, Miles Vorkosigan, Ivan Vorpatril, Falling Free, Aral Vorkosigan, Simon Illyan, Vorbarra, Barrayaran Imperial Auditor, and was equally pleased with the next few books I read, all listed here.I have never been more amused at a line than at ""Ethan would cheerfully have decked any Athosian fundamentalist who insisted that {his new love}'s love for his 'wife' could have no honor in it."" Bujold clearly wanted to say something stern about the prevailing attitude towards gay men and their relationships. Keep in mind it was 1986...mid-AIDS crisis...and there was a lot, a very great deal, an enormous amount of hatred and fear floating around. Even more so than there is today. It was even braver of Bujold to set this story in the SFnal community's playground, since there was an almost complete silence from that fandom on any subject remotely gay male in nature. So this book, over the past 25 years, has symbolized the generosity of straight allies of the gay male community. I admire Bujold as much today as I did then for telling this story. I loved the images of Athosian society, as brief as they were, and fell to contemplating what it would take to make such a culture work, what would be the pitfalls of it, and so on. Nowadays, with the manipulation of the human genome that's headed our unprepared society's way, I think the book is even more relevant and should have an even wider audience.But hey...it's in print and selling 25 years later! Not that many books can make that claim. And for me, that's a really nice thing. A book about a subject that makes a lot of people squirm has that kind of staying power.There just might be hope for humankind after all.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/990093.Ethan_of_Athos

Cherryh;1981;1980;526;3.9;15708;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Hugo Awards', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Speculative Fiction'];A legend among sci-fi readers, C. J. Cherryh's Union-Alliance novels, while separate and complete in themselves, are part of a much larger tapestry—a future history spanning 5,000 years of human civilization. A blockbuster space opera of the rebellion between Earth and its far-flung colonies, it is a classic science fiction masterwork.;This book was too damn long.If you take a glass of whiskey and take a sip and it is too strong, add some water or ice and it makes it more enjoyable. But if you were to take the glass of whiskey and mix it with a gallon of water, then you will likely not even taste the whiskey.If an author takes a great idea and then adds five hundred pages to it, it may be too watered down.Too damn long.C.J. Cherryh's Hugo Award winning space opera novel about a far future Earth and its far flung colonial system and how the farthest out colonies go rogue and of the space station in the middle that tries to stay neutral but can’t and there are cutesy poo aliens who talk like intellectually challenged Ewoks who help out and then there are some assassin clones who have memory problems and then … and then .. and thenNo doubt Ms. Cherryh is an exceptionally talented writer and her imagination and world building are on wonderful display. Her complicated and fully developed alien structures are first class science fiction. And if this were a short story or even a novella, I may have liked, but this was just too much and drawn out too far. I almost invoked my 100-page rule because she took so long in developing the plot that I almost collapsed. I took an atropine injection in the thigh same as if I had been exposed to a nerve agent and kept reading. By the middle of the book, I was at least in cruise control and staying with it.

The Forge of God;Greg Bear;1987;1980;474;3.86;15687;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Apocalyptic', 'Space Opera', 'Aliens'];On July 26, Arthur Gordon learns that Europa, the sixth moon of Jupiter, has disappeared. Not hiding, not turned black, but gone. On September 28th, Edward Shaw, a geologist working in Death Valley, finds a mysterious new cinder cone in very well-mapped area. As more unexplained phenomena spring up around the globe: a granite mountain appearing in Australia, sounds emanating from the Earth's core, flashes of light among the asteroids, it becomes clear to some that the end is approaching, and there is nothing that can be done. In The Forge of God, award-winning author Greg Bear describes the final days of the world on both a massive, scientific scale and in the everyday, emotional context of individual human lives. Facing the destruction of all they know, some people turn to God, others to their families, and a few turn to saviors promising escape from a planet tearing itself apart. Will they make it in time? And who gets left behind to experience the last moments of beauty and chaos on Earth?;"Greg Bear is one of the more popular science fiction authors that I have been neglecting. I have only read his best-known book  Eon prior to this one. Perhaps that is just as well as I have quite a few more to look forward to. I like sci-fi books set in “the present day” (in this case 1996), they tend to be immediately relatable. They also tend to be about First Contact, the meeting of mankind and extraterrestrials.""“Do you have a name?” the President asked. “Not in your language. My name is chemical and goes before me among my own kind.”""Ah, I love such alien weirdness. The Forge of God seems to be all about First Contact during the first half of the book until some unexpected turns of event divert the storyline into an apocalyptic territory. A crashed alien spaceship disguised as a volcanic cinder cone is found in the desert near the town of Shoshone, USA, at the crash site some geologists find an alien in very poor health. Around the same time another faux-cinder cone is found in an Australian desert, no alien found but some robots make contact instead. The alien in the US bears a message of doom, the robots in Australia bring glad tidings for mankind. WTF? Soon the human characters discover something “off” about the alien and the robots and things escalate quickly.The plot of The Forge of God is very intriguing and I had no idea where the story will go. I love the way science is woven into the fabric of the story rather than simply dumped as blocks of info. Biology, geology, physics and astronomy expositions are cleverly used to make the story much more believable (as advantage sci-fi has over fantasy for me). The mystery of who or what the alien and robots are and what their agenda is fascinating. Greg Bear makes more effort than most sci-fi authors to develop his characters. However, for sci-fi this can be a double–edged sword. Sometimes the epic sci-fi storyline dwarfs the characters and the readers become more interested in the events in the story than the struggles of the characters. It is not enough for characters to be believable and realistic, they also need to be interesting, to stand out in a sci-fi epic. I think this is the single flaw of this book, Bear spends a lot of time developing characters, and they do seem like real people, but, unfortunately, not interesting people. It also does not help that there are too many “point of view” characters and most of them remain flat in spite of the author’s valiant efforts.  Arthur C. Clarke never bothered much with characterization, he played to his strength of plotting and storytelling and the style works very well for him.The above-mentioned gripe aside, The Forge of God is a tremendously good read. The ending really is a humdinger, I wish I can tell you something about it without spoiling the book horribly. OK, I’m going to put something behind this spoiler tagged paragraph: It’s the end of the world, dudes! The disintegration of the Earth is described here in amazingly visual details. The description of the world’s end through the eyes of several characters, some located on Earth and some on a spaceship is wonderfully vivid .On the whole, Bear tells a very gripping and wondrous narrative and even gets a few digs in at religious fanatics and politicians. In spite of some superfluous characterization—which does not detract much from the book—I highly recommend this (Hugo and Nebula nominated) book.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64732.The_Forge_of_God
Killashandra;Anne McCaffrey;1985;1980;384;4.07;15442;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Space Opera', 'Adventure'];"The second in a mesmeric trilogy that runs the gamut of human experience and emotion from Anne McCaffrey, storyteller extraordinare and New York Times and Sunday Times bestselling author. Perfect for fans of David Eddings, Brandon Sanderson and Douglas Adams.
'Anne McCaffrey, one of the queens of science fiction, knows exactly how to give her public what it wants' - THE TIMES'Storytelling at its best' -- ***** Reader review'It's Anne Mccaffrey - always 5 star!' -- ***** Reader review'Classic Sci Fi that just hasn't aged' -- ***** Reader review'A real page-turner' -- ***** Reader review******************************************************************************She was one of the Crystal Singers, the élite, mysterious ones, who cut the crystals from the planet Ballybran - precious glittering crystals without which the universe could not function.Sent to the planet of Optheria to repair the famous crystal organ, she was - at first - accorded all the honour and pomp due to her rank. Then her life became threatened and she found herself isolated at the very heart of the planet, knowing that she alone had the power to confront and destroy the evil that had permeated the world of Optheria.Would she be able to find the strength she needed?";"Killashanda is part of a 2024 reading project where I'll be catching up on some series that I've started and enjoyed during my time on Goodreads, but didn't finish. I read Crystal Singer, the first book in this trilogy, all the way back in 2014!Our story starts with Killashandra feeling down and wanting to spend some time away from Ballybran. The opportunity comes with an offworld assignment to Optheria, to repair an organ that has crystals as a major element of its ""manuals"" (I was never super clear how all this worked, even though I looked up the workings of an Earth pipe organ online). The previous engineer was killed when the repair went wrong, and there's no one else qualified to take care of it, so the government on Optheria hires the Crystal Singers' Guild for a substitute on a short-term basis, as a major music festival is coming up soon. Killashandra wins the assignment, and it doesn't take long after her arrival on Optheria for her to be caught up in political unrest and violence that may be directly connected with it.There's a longish section midway through the book that I enjoyed a lot. Killashandra is dumped on a tropical island as part of the aforementioned political unrest, and through effort and luck, eventually is able to make her way to civilization on another one of the islands near by. She meets a handsome fellow named Lars and falls in love, and gets to know the people there, enjoys beachside barbecues, and has a lot of sex, and also learns why no one who lives on Optheria is allowed to leave the planet.Other than that, though, things often got very, very slow. In my very limited experience with her writing, McCaffrey is really good at showing small groups of people enjoying food and drink, and being companionable with each other. (The kind of vibe that I've also been enjoying in the foodie manga I've been reading, come to think of it.) The middle section of the book had a few scenes along these lines. When it comes to the actual plot, though, my interest level was nowhere near as high. In a good number of the SFF novels from this time period that I've read, you have a repressive hidebound group running the place and making things joyless for everyone, and the freewheeling, easygoing rebels who very obviously have the right of things. This one's no different. Toward the end of the book, the automated and bureaucratic galactic Federation enacts an injustice that directly affects Killashandra, and that had a bit (not a lot) more nuance.The prose often gets bogged down and stodgy-feeling, and just as in the first book, the slight content doesn't live up to the vocabulary level. An omniscient point of view is usually enjoyable for me (for its novelty in a limited point of view-standard era, if nothing else), but here it sometimes created additional distance between me and what was going on. For example:
The ignominy of such a humiliating expedient combined with fear, disappointment, and her recent physical ordeal sent Killashandra into a trembling posture of aggrieved and contained fury.
Also similarly to the first book, women's roles are a mixed bag. As a crystal singer, Killashandra works independently and very much earns her own keep on Ballybran. The symbiont she took on when she trained as a crystal singer conveniently makes her infertile but doesn't diminish her sex drive (and also makes her immune to disease that isn't caused by crystal or the symbiont themselves), so she can have all the unprotected sex she wants, and she makes ample use of that convenience with Lars. She is never slut-shamed, either by the narrative or by anyone around her.There's always, though, an uncomfortable assumption--until corrected by herself--that Killashandra might hop into bed with any man who's single and has an ongoing connection with her. And she frequently seems to fall into situations where men ""naturally"" take charge, or she's shepherded around with only a brassy attitude keeping her from being completely inert in the scene she's in. In the eleventh hour of the story she gets injured and the guys end up finishing the plot for her. And Killashandra, hilariously to me, is always the one called upon to push the buttons on the automatic sandwich-making machine:Ch. 13: ""Carrigana? [the alias Killashandra took on when she was stranded on the islands] Would you mind fixing some hungry storm watchers more of those excellent sandwiches?""Ch. 21: Killashandra had punched up sandwiches which she now passed to the men.Killashandra has a heroine's nadir once returning to Ballybran after completing her missions on Optheria, and then a happy ending with Lars when he comes to the planet to become a crystal singer, too. It's the kind of arc that's pleasing even when you know where it's going.As has always been the case with the older SFF I've been reading off and on, this was fun to read, but also had its infuriating parts that show how far we've come in the meantime. It was better than the first book in a number of ways, and I'm grateful for that. I'm interested in seeing what lies in store for Killashandra in the last book of this series. Ideally it won't take another ten years for that to happen....";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/238961.Killashandra

BEWARE!!(dude, you seriously want an audio version of this??)so i read this because bird-brian told me to. i don't know that i am the best person to review sci-fi books. i have zero background in the genre, but for whatever reason, brian thought it would be amusing if i reviewed this. so i will try. soooo - okay - quick plot for you plotty folks out there - genius bad boy scientist gets fired from job for meddling with mammalian cells and conducting experiments outside of his job description. before he gets booted to the curb with his cardboard box, he surreptitiously injects many of his little cells into his own body so he can continue his experiments in the privacy of his own home. oops.once inside his body, they start housekeeping a little. they are like sentient little roombas, fixing his allergies and his eyesight - gentrifying his insides so the nice noocytes can move in and go condo. they make it all better, like when my super put potted plants in my foyer. suddenly, he is stronger and thinner and he can have sexual intercourse FOUR times in a single evening with a girl who approaches him in a bar and then moves in!! he is like jeff goldblum in the fly - he is better than human; he contains multitudes!! and they communicate with him in his miiiind!! but then, much like poor jeff goldblum, he begins to deteriorate. but in this book, he takes everyone with him.and the world goes ffwwoosshh. and that's when it gets a little ""huh?"" for me. so north america is pretty much gone. people turn into like jello?? and so this ""slow"" girl survives. why?? no one knows - i guess she is the only sped in north america and the noocytes can't be bothered fixing her, and then the mother of the now-gelatinized bad boy scientist - she survives because... yeah, well no one knows, and then twin brothers (eeeek) survive because they have a lot of pesticide-exposure?? okay, i can buy that. and then the twins meet up with old science-mama as they flee the rapidly-changing landscape?? sure, makes sense - the USA is not that big after all.but slow girl goes to live in the world trade center (i pour out my 40-ounce) where she is visited by three ghosts who bring her food and... yeah, i don't understand any of this part.again - i don't read a lot of sci-fi. is it traditional in sci-fi that the sci- takes over the more traditional elements of storytelling like characterization?? or is this more of a criticism of a particular kind of science fiction from a particular time (the eighties). because these characters were pretty one-dimensional. and there isn't really a main character because the one you assume will be the main character knocks off pretty quickly... as do the rest...it reminded me a lot of on the beach, which book seemed so unrealistic to me in the way that people just quietly accepted their fate without changing their day-to-day routines... dummies.i have to confess - i have no idea what happened in the post-noocyte takeover of north america. why there were four people left knocking around the whole fucking continent - what their stories were meant to contribute to the greater story - i am at a loss here, guys... i am also at a loss here:""first you need to find a length of viral DNA that codes for topoisomerases and gyrases. you attach this segment to your target DNA and make it easier to lower the linking number - to negatively supercoil your target molecule. i used ethidium in some earlier experiments...""*zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz*""what you want is to add and subtract lengths of input DNA easily, and the feedback enzyme arrangement does this. when the feedback enzyme is in place, the molecule will open itself up for transcription much more easily, and more rapidly. your program will be transcribed onto two strings of RNA. one of the RNA strings will go to a reader - a ribosome - for translation into a protein. initially, the first RNA will carry a simple start-up code""sorry, i totally drifted off there, greg bear.(greg bear also wrote the book moving mars which greg stahl is always talking about. we saw it yesterday during our bookstore jaunting. this is an aside)i don't know... i don't know where this falls in the greater scheme of science fiction, or what i am supposed to have gotten out of it all. i assume it is a cautionary tale about not taking your work home with you, right?? (although if i ever get fired, i am going to inject SO MANY books under my skin so i can read them when i get home. oh god if i got fired, i would have so much free time... kind of tempting...) and the more likely cold-war stuff, but that part is less fun and more blowy-uppy.i did learn that greg bear likes the word ""cocantenations"" as much as proust. and that's all i got.oh, i almost forgot my most favorite bit of dialogue:""i'll never be rid of you,"" bernard said. ""you always represented something important to me."" she swiveled on her high heels and presented the rear of an immaculately tailored blue suit. he grabbed her arm none too gently and brought her around to face him.

The Gate to Women's Country;Sheri S. Tepper;1987;1980;315;4.06;13683;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Feminism', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Speculative Fiction'];Classic fantasy from the amazing Sheri S. Tepper. Women rule in Women's Country. Women live apart from men, sheltering the remains of civilization They have cut themselves off with walls and by ordinance from marauding males. Waging war is all men are good for. Men are allowed to fight their barbaric battles! amongst themselves, garrison against garrison. For the sake of his pride, each boy child ritualistically rejects his mother when he comes of age to be a warrior. But all the secrets of civilization are strictly the possession of women. Naturally, there are men who want to know what the women know! And when Stavia meets Chernon, the battle of the sexes begins all over again. Foolishly, she provides books for Chernon to read. Before long, Chernon is hatching a plan of revenge against women!;"I don't know what it is, but lately I've been feeling like a country where women make all their own decisions about politics, their bodies, human rights and pregnancy sounds pretty fucking great right now. I'm not an idealist by nature, and I went to high school so I know that women can be nasty fuckers too, yet still. Thinking I might take my chances. Because if I hear one more man voice his-- completely irrelevant, unneeded, and insulting --opinion about women's bodily autonomy, I might literally explode.*mops sweaty brow* This book is interesting, but dated. In some ways far more glaringly than others. Tepper has put a lot of thought into her ""utopia"" run by women, and she has a lot of interesting things to say about the problems with our own society-- namely, that too many men are violent controlling assholes and too many women go googly-eyed for said men because of ""infatuation"". She may be onto something. Either way, I can definitely agree that women don't always pursue their own interests in sex, love or politics.What's the answer? Well, eugenics, of course. Make sure women only get jiggy with the kind, gentle men who will make more kind, gentle men (hmm, interesting) and get rid of those pesky homosexuals while you're at it (wait, what?!). Oh yes, don't forget that being gay is a disorder that can now thankfully be corrected before birth. Yikes.I find Women's Country itself quite fascinating. It grew after a nuclear war nearly wiped out the human race and the survivors decided a world run by men just wasn't working out. So much thought and detail has gone into the creation of this world. But the ideology behind it? Needs some work, I have to say. I am yet to be convinced that a world run solely by women would result in the utopian dream. I can believe-- based on statistical evidence --that Women's Country would be less physically violent than a patriarchal society. I do not, however, believe this necessarily equates to peace. Women can cut you in other ways.Also, pretty sure the author is doing her best to excuse a scene that is clearly rape.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104344.The_Gate_to_Women_s_Country

But even as he gambles on the breakthrough technology, he is wracked with the guilt of losing his wife, poised forever at the ""event horizon"" of a black hole where Robin had abaondoned her. As more and more information comes back from the expedition, Robin grows ever hopeful that he can rescue his beloved Gelle-Klara Moynlin. After three and a years, the factory is discovered to work, and a human is found aboard. Robin's suffering may be just about over....THE HEECHEE SAGABook GatewayBook Beyond the Blue Event HorizonBook Heechee RendezvousBook The Annals of the HeecheeFrom the Paperback edition.";Beyond the Blue Event Horizon was a solid sequel to Gateway. Frederik Pohl's engaging writing style makes it easy for the reader to get caught up in the stories of his characters even when those characters themselves are not the most likeable. Robinette Broadhead struck it rich in his time as a Gateway prospector but is still suffering from the feelings of guilt at how his last mission ended. He no longer goes on Gateway missions himself but has sponsored many other adventurers. One such group is a family of four. Their mission is to fly to newly discovered Heechee outpost in the Oort Cloud and attempt to move it closer to Earth. Broadhead and other suspect it might have been a food making facility of some sort and hope it can be used to ease the resources plight on Earth. The story was interesting. The Heechee still remain a bit of a mystery but their technology is still pretty cool and we do learn a few of their secrets in this one. The POV cast was a lot more diverse. We got viewpoints from Broadhead, all four members of the family he sent to space, from a human boy who was discovered living on the Heechee facility, and even from a non-human! As with the first book the characters are far from perfect examples of humanity but most of the time you find yourself routing for them despite their actions. This was a good sci-fi story. The Heechee Saga is definitely one of the better sci-fi series I've read over the years. It has the right balance between the characters and the harder sci-fi aspects of the story.Rating: 4 stars.Audio Note: Oliver Wyman gave a fantastic performance with the audio production.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/373399.Beyond_the_Blue_Event_Horizon

Soon, Luke, Han, the princess and their faithful companions were forced to flee, scattering in all directions—the Dark Lord's minions in fevered pursuit....;"Star Wars at its best!!!
I have bought the Omnibus edition with the three original “Star Wars” movie novelizations but I’ve chosen this edition to make a better focused review of each single book.
ONCE PERFECT, THERE IS LITTLE TO ADD
It wasn’t a surprise that there are few relevant additions to this novelization, since you have to admit that Empire Strikes Back is Star Wars at its best and even good ol’ Georgie couldn’t add much to the Special Edition of the film, just a couple of CGI brief scenes, to justify the existence of a special edition of that superb film.However, certainly there are some changes here and there in the novelization, since it’s normal that during actually making the film, there are last minute modifications or special effects troubles and the assigned writer isn’t informed on time to make the adjustment on the prose novelization as well.Sooo……once again, if you passed the last 40 years or so, frozen in carbonite, and you hadn’t watched the film, please be warned that you may find some spoilers ahead……the novelization started already on Hoth with Luke and Han, instead on space with the Imperial Starfleet. And there are A LOT of more wampas in the novelization than the just one in the film, actually Echo Base is attacked by wampas! …a big difference is that Hobbie (one Rogue Squadron fighter pilot) crashes his snowspeeder against General Veers’ AT-AT, killing all there.…believe it or not, Yoda is blue!!! I guess that if X-Wings’ blue stripes on A New Hope couldn’t work with the blue screens, the same colorful trouble risen again with the muppet of the old Jedi Master, so at the film they had to changed it to green. And by the way, on Dagobah, it’s mentioned that Vader’s lightsaber is blue, instead of iconic red! I guess that blue is favorite color of George Lucas and it must be a bummer (for him) having to change the blue stuff in his films due fx limitations of the time.…Han and Leia could kiss alright at the Millenium Falcon! Oh, yeah! BUT there isn’t “I know” at Cloud City, aaaaah bummer (but I knew that it wouldn’t be since that iconic quote was Harrison Ford’s brilliant improvisation while filming the scene).…The Ugnaughts are wiser in the novelization and they didn’t argue with Chewie. I always wondered if those ugly dwarfish aliens had some kind of deathwish, looking for a fight with a wookie!…Luke’s rescue by the Millenium Falcon is a lot more daring and risky!Plus, some other minor stuff, here and there, pretty much this is it, and as you can see, there were like changes due fx troubles or scenes ended cut at the editing room, than actually any real valuable addition to the prose novelization.Still, if you are reading the Star Wars novelizations, certainly you can’t miss this one, once you’re on that!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77111.Star_Wars
The Many-Coloured Land;Julian  May;1981;1980;415;4.06;13025;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Speculative Fiction'];In the year 2034, Theo Guderian, a French physicist, made an amusing but impractical discovery: the means to use a one-way, fixed-focus time warp that opened into a place in the Rhone River valley during the idyllic Pliocene Epoch, six million years ago. But, as time went on, a certain usefulness developed. The misfits and mavericks of the future—many of them brilliant people—began to seek this exit door to a mysterious past. In 2110, a particularly strange and interesting group was preparing to make the journey—a starship captain, a girl athlete, a paleontologist, a woman priest, and others who had reason to flee the technological perfection of twenty-second-century life.Thus begins this dazzling fantasy novel that invites comparisons with the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, Arthur C. Clarke, and Ursula Le Quin. It opens up a whole world of wonder, not in far-flung galaxies but in our own distant past on Earth—a world that will captivate not only science-fiction and fantasy fans but also those who enjoy literate thrillers.The group that passes through the time-portal finds an unforeseen strangeness on the other side. Far from being uninhabited, Pliocene Europe is the home of two warring races from another planet. There is the knightly race of the Tanu—handsome, arrogant, and possessing vast powers of psychokinesis and telepathy. And there is the outcast race of Firvulag—dwarfish, malevolent, and gifted with their own supernormal skills. Taken captive by the Tanu and transported through the primordial European landscape, the humans manage to break free, join in an uneasy alliance with the forest-dwelling Firvulag, and, finally, launch an attack against the Tanu city of light on the banks of a river that, eons later, would be called the Rhine.Myth and legend, wit and violence, speculative science and breathtaking imagination mingle in this romantic fantasy, which is the first volume in a series about the exile world.;According to the publisher Angry Robot, Julian May has died, age 86. The sad news has motivated to review this book, which I haven't read in 30 years.I think it was Julian May who gave me the taste for mixing fantasy and science fiction. This, excellent, series is set mainly in the Pliocene era of Earth, where miscreants from our distant future are exiled via a time portal. Back in this past, several million years before our time, these futuristic exiles try to make a life for themselves with the hi-tech objects they are allowed to take with them. They are a very eclectic bunch including a man who believes in Narnia and Aslan, a gay nun, a skilled thief who won't give up crime, all sorts.This is a time of woolly mammoths rather than dinosaurs, but the twist is that psychic aliens are there already and set to enslaving our exiles. There are various factions among the humans and the aliens, and the alien technology wakes psychic powers among the humans too. It all gets complicated but the imagination is unbounded and the writing very good. It's a tale that took hold of me and had me reading the next five or six books in relatively swift order.I still see people talk about the series, but not as many as there should be. Pick up book 1 and see what you've been missing out on all these years! I read quite a few books in the series and it's a great body of work.RIP Julian May. Thank you for your stories.

In 2011 I awarded a two star rating to Frank Herbert’s 1981 novel, God Emperor of Dune, the fourth in his Dune series and I even stayed away from Herbert’s writing for years afterward. Revisiting the series in 2021 I reread God Emperor and realized that in the time in between readings my opinion of the work had changed dramatically and I now very much appreciated that work and increased my rating to a 4 star.As a big fan of Robert A. Heinlein’s writing, I have long sung the praises of his Scribner’s juvenile books as well as the genre defining work he did in the 60s. I have been a less than enthusiastic fan of his later works, which I called “self indulgent” in my below review.In 2021 and again in 2023 I reread his 1982 book Friday and like Herbert’s work, I realized that maybe I had not read this in the correct frame of mind and also understood that I needed to reread Heinlein’s The Number of the Beast from 1980.So I embarked on a reread of Number of the Beast, and like God Emperor, I have changed my mind about my earlier thoughts on his work.This time I GROK his meaning.Did Bob Heinlein, 40 years earlier than most of the rest of the world, explore gender studies?Here’s the thing: Heinlein had been peeling back the conservatism of his earlier work and only fans picked up on what he was really doing, which is to explore a world where there were no mores as we know them now. The endless banter back and forth was sexual and sexuality centered, but he was reassigning gender roles and then by the end of the book he had thrown out western civilization as a rule of law / enforceable customs and was doing his thing unmoored, unfettered by traditional values.Poul Anderson and especially John Varley had done this before, but for Heinlein to do what he has done here, is really phenomenal and I’m glad that I have reread so that I can really pick up on his vision.Wait! Isn’t this about the multiverse and visiting Oz and Barsoom and even some of Heinlein’s own earlier works?Yes! He does all this!So I am going to reread all of his later works to see what else I have missed.***A fan of Robert A. Heinlein’s earlier works, generally classified as his “juveniles” published from 1947 until the late 50s, may be confused and disappointed by his 1980 novel Number of the Beast. Also, those familiar with and inspired by his middle period, roughly late 1950s until 1970, spanning the publications of The Door Into Summer in 1957 until I Will Fear No Evil in 1970 (the period that I regard as his zenith) may likely be nonplussed by what is going on in this work published when the grandmaster was 73 years old. To be certain, a Heinlein story where four interesting characters experience an adventure into Barsoom and Wonderland and Oz and also meet up with some classic Heinlein characters like Lazarus Long and Jubal Harshaw sounds like a great story and much of it is … but. As much of a fan as I am, I cannot help but apply the damning tag of self-indulgent. First of all, it’s about twice as long as it needs to be. A 200 page Number of the Beast would have been much better, faster paced and pithy. Secondly, had the man moved into a nudist colony and time traveled to pick up a septuagenarian value pack of Cymbalta? I love the libertarianism and his egalitarian sexism, but Time Enough for Love was enough already. Finally, he went on and on and on some more about militaristic group dynamics until the worthwhile and relevant observations on leadership and command were lost in blurred paragraphs and diminished by over exposure. I cannot help but compare this work to Poul Anderson’s Harvest of Stars (which had some traces of homage to Heinlein), which was published in 1993 when Anderson (another SFWA Grandmaster) was 67. This was a libertarian space opera that would have had Philip K. Dick scratching his head.Like The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick, Heinlein’s The Number of the Beast may only be for true fans.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50877.The_Number_of_the_Beast
The Snow Queen;Joan D. Vinge;1980;1980;448;3.95;12912;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Hugo Awards', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fairy Tales'];This reissue of a modern classic of science fiction, the Hugo and Locus Award-winning and Nebula-nominated The Snow Queen, marks the first time the book has been reprinted in fifteen years.The imperious Winter colonists have ruled the planet Tiamat for 150 years, deriving wealth from the slaughter of the sea mers. But soon the galactic stargate will close, isolating Tiamat, and the 150-year reign of the Summer primitives will begin. Their only chance at surviving the change is if Arienrhod, the ageless, corrupt Snow Queen, can destroy destiny with an act of genocide. Arienrhod is not without competition as Moon, a young Summer-tribe sibyl, and the nemesis of the Snow Queen, battles to break a conspiracy that spans space. Interstellar politics, a millennia-long secret conspiracy, and a civilization whose hidden machineries might still control the fate of worlds all form the background to this spectacular hard science fiction novel from Joan D. Vinge.;"This is higher end political space opera that borrows a number of themes and central plot components from Frank Herbert’s  Dune, while creatively retelling the Han’s Christian Anderson story for which it’s named. I found much to like here. Vinge has quality prose skills and does a excellent job with both world-building and layering in a well thought out political structure. She has also peopled her narrative with strong, determined, intelligent central characters, all of whom are women. A nice change from the mostly male dominated SF of the period. Finally, she has deftly wrapped all of the above inside a complex, engaging plot that I found very entertaining. Yeah, this is science fiction done right and this story definitely deserves a wider readership. 
BACKGROUND/BACK-STORY
From the wreckage of a large, powerful galactic empire, a small group of planets have organized into a consortium calling itself the Hegemony. The Hegemony is glued together by its ability to connect to member planets via leftover empire technology. These black gates (think miniature black holes/worm holes) allow instantaneous travel between the vast distances separating member planets.One of member planets (and the star of our tale) is Tiamet. However, because of a unique solar phenomenon, Tiamat is only accessible by the other Hegemonic worlds for 150 out of every 300 years. The rest of the time, Tiamat is completely isolated. Tiamat’s importance to the Hegemony stems from it being the only source of the spice melange “water of life,” a drug that completely retards the aging process. In order to keep Tiamat dependant on the Hegemony wares and thus allowing the Hegemony to keep itself drenched in the “water of life,” Tiamat is prevented from establishing its own technology base. The “water of life”...must...flow. 
POLITICAL ORGANIZATION
The government of Tiamat is matriarchal and constituted in a manner directly tied to the 150 year periods of access and isolation to the Hegemony. The population of the planet is radically divided into two groups that have a serious nasty on for one another. Group 1 is comprised of the Winters who rule during the 150 years of Hegemony access to Tiamat. The Winters are gadget-loving, hedonistic technophiles who welcome the hegemonic traders and all the advanced baubles they bring to make their lives comfy. Group 2 is comprised of the Summers who rule during the 150 years of isolation from the Hegemony. The Summers are environment-worshipping luddites tied to folk-traditions who despise both the Hegemony and the Winters for the devastation they cause to the environment, specifically the hunting to near extinction of the peaceful, marine-faring Mers (think adorable, highly intelligent sea otters larger than killer whales). 
PLOT SUMMARY
Against this richly textured backdrop, the Snow Queen is a deftly executed example of the hero’s coming of age journey that leads to a reordering of the status quo and a brighter future for the hero’s people. To tell this tale, Vinge gives us 3 very strong central characters all of whom play a key role in the outcome of the story. First we have Arienhod, the titular Snow Queen. Arienhod has ruled for the entire 150 years of the Winter Cycle (thank you “water of life”). Now the time of the Change is approaching when a Summer Queen will be named and Arienhod will be become a sacrificial offering to usher in the new regime. As you might imagine, Arienhod doesn’t like that plan and is working on an alternate arrangement that will keep her in power.Second, we have our hero, Moon Dawntreader Summer. Moon, a member of the primitive Summer tribe, pursues her life long ambition to become a “sibyl,” a sacred position among her people similar to an oracle (the true nature of the “sibyl” is one of the mysterious of the story I don't want to spoil but I thought Vinge did a great job with the concept). To achieve her goal of becoming a “sibyl,” Moon is forced to give up her relationship with her cousin/lover Sparks. The fall out from this relationship plays a pivotal role in the rest of the story as Sparks eventually comes to the attention of Arienhod. After assuming her role as “sibyl” and due in no small part to the loss of her relationship with Sparks, Moon finds herself on a voyage of discovery that will take her from Tiamat to the heart of the Hegemony and back again as she unravels the mystery of her ancestry, the purpose of the “sibyls” and the ancient legacy of Tiamat that holds the key to her planet's future. The final main player in our space drama is Jerusha PalaThion, my favorite character of the novel. Jerusha is a police inspector stationed on Tiamat and responsible for protecting the interest of the Hegemony by preventing unauthorized technology from being created. Jerusha acts as both obstacle to and facilitator of various plot components and ends up playing a crucial role in the final resolution of the story. Jerusha was the most three-dimensional of the novel’s characters and thought Vinge did an excellent job with her.  
OVERALL
Overall, I thought this was intelligent, well written space opera that deserves a far larger audience than it seems to have. My only gripe is that the pacing was a bit uneven at times and there were some dry parts that I thought could have been spiced up a bit. However, the story as a whole was very good and I would certainly recommend it for those that enjoy less action-based and more plot-focused science fiction.4.0 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139986.The_Snow_Queen

Tepper. this story seemed to know exactly what i was longing for: Horror in Space! and so she provided it to me. a fascinating planet full of strange multi-colored grass, bizarre fauna, the ruins of an alien civilization. a backdrop based around a particularly esoteric and semi-totalitarian theocracy. an expertly portrayed and atypical heroine who felt alive and real (and who rather reminded me of Deborah Kerr in her various classy roles). a perfect introduction to the planet's aristocrats, well-rendered through the eyes of an uncomfortable young lady on her first foxhunt. a foxhunt that is not a foxhunt, but something else entirely - something inexplicable, something horrible. a feeling of claustrophobia - but, uniquely, a claustrophobia based on an entire planet, one filled with huge living spaces and wide, windy open ranges. an atrocious plague spreading like wildfire from planet to planet. the unsettling sound of beasts stamping out a threatening dance from not-so-distant caverns. my gosh, those bizarre fauna! the various moments portraying them gazing silently and malevolently at characters, up close and even more eerily in the distant grasses... such brilliantly sinister tableaux! and those foxhunts!this story was full of twisted emotions, strained familial relations, ambiguous motivations, intriguing mysteries, and a constant yet subtle sense of increasing dread. how enchanting! wonderful chills ensued from this delightful story. i looked on Grass by Sheri S. Tepper as the child i've never had but always wanted. a sort of Wednesday Adams-Monday. i was filled with pleasure at the sight of her.

alas, the child grew up. somewhere around page 200, i think. that winsome feeling of terror just on the horizon, that sweet sense of horror lurking just around the corner, all the subtlety and strange wonder... vanished. it was replaced by confusing xenobiology, a didactic chemistry lecture, a ham-handed coincidence (oops, that extremely important and provocative letter just dropped out of that villain's pocket!), increasingly two-dimensional characters, an extremely lame vision of God, creepy alien sex (and not the good kind), the idea that a rebellious daughter is better off with her mind wiped clean, and repetitious obsessiveness with original sin & what makes a good wife & who is in love with who now and why and why won't they. a precocious child grew into a distinctly tedious adult.but i will try to remember that child! because the first half or so of this book was awesome.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104342.Grass

A glance at the other Goodreads reviews of this book will tell you why; the vast majority of them seem to give it a rating of one or two stars with passionate complaints about the sex in the book, the “horniness” of the first-person narrator, the lack of action (!), etc. A very few give it five stars, suggesting it perhaps was Heinlein’s greatest book; put me in that latter category. I find myself absolutely amazed that I had no idea that this book existed until 24 years after its publication, and I only happened to notice it because one of the librarians displayed it on a shelf with its cover showing, depicting a voluptuous red-headed nude (with parts of her anatomy discreetly covered by her flowing red hair, standing in a very large clam shell (which has nothing to do with the story), accompanied by a cat sitting beside her (a cat sitting on his tail, by the way, despite the fact that he is repeatedly described as always having his tail pointing straight up).Many moons ago (52 years ago, actually) I attended a conference for technical writers in St. Louis, where the keynote speaker was an admiral who berated us all for writing boring technical manuals and demanded to know why we could not write manuals as interesting as Heinlein’s novels. I happened to have a Heinlein pocketbook in my back pocket at the time, and it took all my self-control to prevent myself from leaping to my feet and yelling “Because he can write about sex, and we have to write about gizmos.” I now think that anecdote shows the silliness of my youth; Heinlein did not write about sex—he wrote novels in which one or more of the characters engaged in sex one or more times as part of the historical narration of the overall story, and that is just as true here as it was then. Yes, Maureen does have sex--with a teenage boy in her town, then with her cousin, then with some other boys and even a couple men, including her eventual husband, and later with friends … and eventually with her son and perhaps with a great-great-grandson or two--but the gross details of the acts, such as run rampant through all the trashy romances my eldest loves to read, are not given; it all happens between paragraphs, or even between lines. More to the point, it all happens over the course of a few thousand years, actually, and the real point of the story is to get from one end (early in the 19th century in Minnesota) to the other (God know when or where), involving time travel, multiple universes, extra-dimension cross connections, and the inevitable change of the human condition through all those years.The other chief complaint against Heinlein seems to be that he engaged in social engineering by promoting ideas different from those held by the majority of men. But isn’t that true of all writers? I’ve must finished other reviews of books by Charlene Harris, Anne Perry, and Patricia Cornwell, and I have to believe that their characters were being portrayed in such a way as to reflect the authors’ ideas that we all should think differently about certain things. Harris shows that small-minded Christians cannot accept ways of life outside their own (such as vampires, werewolves, fairies, etc.); Perry is fascinated about the different and disparate ways of life of the rich and the poor, and Cornwell projects the hope that goodness and intelligence eventually must win out over the evildoers of the world. Heinlein himself maintained that all this prolific outpouring was not social engineering at all but just writing to entertain (and to sell).This was Heinlein’s last book, published when he was dying at the age of 80. He had already established a practice of weaving his various different novels and stories together, and this one was simply a continuation and culmination of that same trend. It also requires a basic background understanding by the reader of various diverse concepts that had evolved in science fiction since he and John Campbell essentially created the genre back in the days of my childhood, as this novel ties a lot of them together. My parents would not have liked this book, and I have friends who would have no idea what it was talking about for most of its length.I was amused that one of the debunking reviewers proclaimed that he stopped reading the book half way through because there wasn’t enough science-fiction (!) … while another protested that the sex scenes were described in clinical detail (!) … and another expressed strong objections about the unrealistic portrayal of women in Heinlein’s writings. There can be no doubt that most of Heinlein’s women (and particularly Maureen Johnson) were based on his second wife, Virginia, whom he truly loved throughout their long marriage. I was also amused to notice how many of the 1-star and 2-star reviews had misspelled words, incorrect homonyms, and totally irrelevant comments.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/354.To_Sail_Beyond_the_Sunset
Timescape;Gregory Benford;1980;1980;499;3.72;11226;no;['Science Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Audiobook'];The author of Tides of Light offers his Nebula Award-winning SF classic—a combination of hard science, bold speculation, and human drama. In the year 1998, a group of scientists works desperately to communicate with the scientists of 1962, warning of an ecological disaster that will destroy the oceans in the future—if it is not averted in the past.;"The Coolness—• This book won the Nebula in 1980! Pretty cool for it and the author, Gregory Benford. It would have been nice for Hilary Foister to share in the credit, though, considering she supposedly co-wrote this with Benford.• It deals with tachyons! (once in a while)• It works well as a mild sedative.The Meh!-ness—• There are some cool bits of forward thinking in this book, although none of them are truly prophetic, and they needed to be if they were going to be better than average. Benford and Foister project some terrorism in New York (which is a bit like a Sci-Fi writer suggesting that someday the Boston Red Sox would once again win the World Series), some ecological disaster, some biological disaster, some poverty and some hunger. Wow! That's bravely walking the plank, isn't it?• This book receives much praise for its “strong” characterization, but I’ve always felt that strong characterization requires more than just time spent with the characters; it also requires a thorough understanding of at least one character’s depths and shallows. We need to get inside a character and really experience the meat of him/her. Not so here. We meet quite a few characters, mostly men, spending a lot of time with Ian Peterson (a womanizing English “gentleman”), John Renfrew (a whiny physicist from England of the nineties), and Gordon Bernstein (a whiny physicist from the US of the sixties), but I never felt like I knew any of them well, nor did I want to get to know them any better. If this really is the strongest aspect of Timescape, it is a fine example of why this book deserves no accolades.The Crapness—• There is no way in hell this book deserved the Nebula award in 1980 or any other time. How it beat books like Joan D Vinge’s The Snow Queen or Walter Tevis’ Mockingbird I will never understand. This book was barely Sci-Fi, and I think I would have appreciated it far more if the clever little time messaging business had been taken out completely. A novel about Scientific competition in the sixties would have been good enough for me, and it was the story Benford and Foister were telling anyway, and I wouldn't have spent the bulk of the novel hoping for the Sci-Fi elements that never came. • Sadly, the cool bits of forward thinking were matched by some clangers. The authors imagined a late-20th century world where all the movie theatres were closing down out of disinterest, a world where photographic film was strictly rationed and no digital cameras were invented to pick up the slack (which wouldn’t have been a problem if it weren’t for the fact that the tachyon messenger was sending what amounted to digital images), a world where a woman being a housewife was expected by everyone everywhere, which leads me too ....• The portrayal of women in this book annoyed me constantly. It wasn’t that Benford (not to mention his ghostly partner because he didn’t, after all) was misogynistic. I didn’t sense any hatred of women in his writing. What was clearly present, however, was the cloistered attitude of an academic in a field that – in the Eighties – kept women firmly out of its ranks. It is the writing of a man out of touch with the changing social conventions of his day, which translated into an inability to foresee the way social conventions would be formed seventeen years later. Benford’s downfall is a lazy acceptance of patriarchy and a lack of imagination for past, present, and future gender roles.• The authors’ sickening defence of those three unassailable pillars of benevolence: England, the USA and the educated middle class. Puke, puke, puke.• Racism towards the whole of South America, with special attention given to Brazil and Argentina. The bulk of the ecological blame falls to Brazil for their destruction of the rainforests, but there is no mention, anywhere in the book, of the worldwide market forces that must motivate such destruction.• Page 413-414 of my copy – which I received as a bookmooch – are missing. It looks like someone took an Xacto knife to the page, and I am dying to know why and what the hell I am missing. If any of you have a copy of this book, I would appreciate a photocopy of the pages so I can read them and add them to my copy. I suppose it’s not a big deal, though, since the book was far from impressive.• Finally ... JFK survives! And there was definitely only one shooter.

Society has broken down and people have settled into enclaves for the protection that government can no longer provide. And like Butler's Xenogenesis Series, there is an exploration of humans losing their humanity. This is something Butler does in very compelling and innovative ways in Xenogenesis. However, it is only given very brief attention here, more as a horror for the would-be parents than a true exploration.

Star Wars: Return of the Jedi;James Kahn;1983;1980;181;4.06;10670;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];It was a dark time for the Rebel Alliance...Han Solo, frozen in carbonite, has been delivered into the hands of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt. Determined to rescue him, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Lando Calrissian launch a hazardous mission against Jabba's Tatooine stronghold.Now, in the most exciting chapter of the STAR WARS saga, the Rebel commanders have gathered all the warships of the Rebel fleet into a single giant armada. And Darth Vader, who has ordered construction to begin on a new and even more powerful Death Star, makes his plans to crush the Rebel Alliance once and for all.;"The Original Trilogy comes to an end!
I have bought the Omnibus edition with the three original “Star Wars” movie novelizations but I’ve chosen this edition to make a better focused review of each single book.So, once again, if you haven't watched this movie due being frozen in carbonite for 40 years or so, then don't read any further since there are spoilers ahead! Don't say that I didn't warn you, Rebel Scum!
ANOTHER DEATH STAR…REALLY?!
Thanks to Rogue One, we now know that the Empire didn’t do on purpose the fabrication mistake leading to the destruction of the first Death Star……but after losing that humongous mobile station, drastically reducing the financial resources of the Galactic Empire, one thought that they should invest in ANYTHING else but……another blasted Death Star!!!Geez!!!Especially when the Emperor Palpatine didn’t wait until it would be totally finished, at least in its outside armored plates to avoid any incursión of fightercraft in the eventuality of losing the protection of the energy shield (that obviously precisely happened).I admire Palpatine since he’s one of the very few villains that has been allowed to win and keep in control of the Empire for like 20 years, not much fiction villains are able to enjoy such long victory time without any sensible intervention of heroes. But, it’s sadly unbelievable to see that at the end of his successful period in command of the galaxy, he was “forced” (by good ol’ Georgie’s script) to come up with an uninspired plan of making a second Death Star, instead of choosing something else more ingenious and useful, like a whole fleet of Super Star Destroyers.And to make it more indignantly, there are the Ewoks, it’s not like I hate them per se, they’re cute alright, but I still can’t believe that a bunch of space care bears were able to defeat in ground combat to a whole Imperial Stormtroopers’ detachment. I’m sure that those Ewoks should think that the Rebel Alliance were a pack of fools, since they were battling the Empire for 23 years without success and the Ewoks “beat” the Empire in an afternoon.Geez!!!
SO WHAT’S DIFFERENT HERE ANYWAY?
I have to admit that while Return of the Jedi novelizations have several relevant additional scenes, like……Luke Skywalker making his new lightsaber at Obi-Wan’s house.…Jabba is a lot more disgusting and meaner to poor Leia during her slave time.…Ewoks were a lot more difficult to convince them to help the Rebels.…you can read about the whole inner conflict on Darth Vader’s mind between his loyalty to the Emperor and the option of helping Luke.…Palpatine is able to learn that Yoda was Luke’s second teacher of his Jedi training.…the Second Death Star was seconds away of destroying Endor’s moon.And as you can guess, always there are odd comments that they are contradictory with the whole Star Wars story, taking in account how the Prequel Trilogy was developed……Obi-Wan’s force spirit tells Luke that Owen Lars was his brother (what?!) and that her mom, in other words, Padmé Amidala, died when Luke and Leia were four years old (dang!).…Palpatine’s backstory is told in detail, but due the Prequel trilogy, and even if you may indulge me with the existence of some (now “legends” (non-canonical)) novels like Darth Plagueis (that it should be titled Darth Sidious, since it was more developed the life of Palpatine than Plagueis), you may guess that many of those details became contradictory.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77236.Star_Wars
Mockingbird;Walter Tevis;1980;1980;288;4.16;10402;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Audiobook', 'Robots', 'Speculative Fiction'];Mockingbird is a powerful novel of a future world where humans are dying. Those that survive spend their days in a narcotic bliss or choose a quick suicide rather than slow extinction. Humanity's salvation rests with an android who has no desire to live, and a man and a woman who must discover love, hope, and dreams of a world reborn.;"I could tell with in the first few paragraphs of this book I was really going to like it. The story starts with Robert Spofforth, a very special robot, in fact a Make Nine robot, whistling as he walks down the street. Now to me whistling is a very distinctive human trait. I know some birds can be taught to whistle and I'm sure someone has spent numerous hours of their life teaching their dog to whistle, but generally I think humans are the only entity on the planet bad ass enough to actually whistle as we walk through the woods or across the plains announcing our presence to everything ""here I am"". Alright so Tevis got my attention right away. I put the book on my stack of reading now books and promptly got caught up in a monster of a book 900+ that I checked out from the library and had a deadline to finish, a self imposed deadline as I still like to torture myself in ways that make no sense to any one else. It was a long time before I had a chance to get back to Mockingbird, but the whole time I'm flagellating myself with the large tomb from the library I'm thinking about Mockingbird. 

When I do get back to it I'm nearly salivating, I sit down like a guy who has been lost in the desert and is about to drink his first glass of water that wasn't freshly squeezed out of a cactus. I fall in. My daughter asks me a question and I look at her with a blank look before promptly returning my eyes to the pages. Okay so I'm not going to win Dad of the year and I was so close this year.

The idea of having robots do our work for us sounds like a great idea. We should be able to edify ourselves, spend our time reading great works (Christians could finally read the bible.), writing poetry, learning to paint, and having philosophical discussions about whether the chair and table do really exist. Unfortunately I fear that most people would just spend more time in front of the television inhaling their drug of choice. I may be too cynical here, but in Mockingbird that is exactly what happened. People take handfuls of sopors and killed time until the television programs started. Over several generations after building more and more robots to the point that the human race can no longer fix or design or have an original thought the robots, due to a lack of interest by the human race, take over. There was no coup, no uprising with humans fighting to take back there place at the top of the heap. We simply handed over our lives to our creations. In the movie Surrogates starring no other than, Bruce Willis, (the salvation of the human race time and time again), we have an avatar idealized version of ourselves that we move about the world to go to work, to have sex, basically a realized version of a video game that allows the human race to not only stay home, but stay in one room wired into their surrogate all day. We of course turn to mush. I would have really been worried about our chances if Bruce Willis hadn't been in the movie. 

Well in Mockingbird, Paul, is our Bruce Willis. He is a university professor who really doesn't teach anything anymore because over several generations people have quit learning to read. Not even the robots know how to read. Paul starts researching old silent movies and has an epiphany that the subtitles at the bottom, the squiggles, actually represent what is being said in the film. Over the course of watching many, many films he teaches himself the rudimentary words of the English language. Lets just say the genie is now out of the bottle.Paul has to fight against the pithy statements that have been drilled into his head: ""Quick sex is best."", ""Don't ask; relax."" He starts to replace these short bits of controlling propaganda with pieces of literature that just keep nagging at him. ""My life is light, waiting for the death wind, Like a feather on the back of my hand."" and ""Only the mockingbird sings at the edge of the woods."" These thoughts are a little more complex. They stretch Paul's mind and he starts to see the world for what it really is a shallow, unsatisfactory, anti-utopian. There is a lot more to this book than what I've decided to touch on here, for only 247 pages the book really packs a wallop. I'm a big fan of Dystopia society books and this will certainly be one I add to my recommendation list.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/323172.Mockingbird
The Integral Trees;Larry Niven;1983;1980;272;3.76;9241;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Adventure'];When leaving Earth, the crew of the spaceship Discipline was prepared for a routine assignment. Dispatched by the all-powerful State on a mission of interstellar exploration and colonization, Discipline was aided (and secretly spied upon) by Sharls Davis Kendy, an emotionless computer intelligence programmed to monitor the loyalty and obedience of the crew. But what they weren’t prepared for was the smoke ring–an immense gaseous envelope that had formed around a neutron star directly in their path. The Smoke Ring was home to a variety of plant and animal life-forms evolved to thrive in conditions of continual free-fall. When Discipline encountered it, something went wrong. The crew abandoned ship and fled to the unlikely space oasis.Five hundred years later, the descendants of the Discipline crew living on the Smoke Ring no longer remember their origins. Earth is more myth than memory, and no recollection of the State remains. But Kendy remembers. And just outside the Smoke Ring, Discipline waits patiently to make contact with its wayward children.;"Christmas 2010: I realised that I had got stuck in a rut. I was re-reading old favourites again and again, waiting for a few trusted authors to release new works. Something had to be done.On the spur of the moment I set myself a challenge, to read every book to have won the Locus Sci-Fi award. That’s 35 books, 6 of which I’d previously read, leaving 29 titles by 14 authors who were new to me.While working through this reading list I got married, went on my honeymoon, switched career and became a father. As such these stories became imprinted on my memory as the soundtrack to the happiest period in my life (so far).Oh, what to say about 

The Integral Trees

? The concept may have seemed strange and original back in ’85, but to the mind of this genre-burnt geek, familiar with the works it (presumably) helped inspire, it felt comfortable, cosy and tame.There’s a gas ring around a neutron star full of free-fall life forms, with stranded humans living a floating Peter-Pan hunter-gatherer lifestyle amid the alien eco-system with their cultural memories of civilised planets little more than myths of legends... It’s a story about gradually broadening horizons: our little tribe of survivors live in/on/around a zero-g space tree. Their tree is their world. Then – OMG! – they’re tossed off the tree and discover more humans living on other trees! Dare to dream; their might even be humans outside the gas ring – oh wait, there’s a spaceship! Whoa, what a mindfrack!I’m not going to call this a great book. None of the characters are particularly vivid or memorable. The story isn’t revolutionary or daring. There’s nowt in the way of a thematic suckerpunch. Applicable words to describe this book are: FUN, ESCAPISM, ROMP, PLAYFUL and SMART.I recommend this to fans of Asimov and/or Varley – for me this fell halfway between the style of the latter Foundation books and Titan. I’ve heard that Pohl would make this ménage à trois a full on four-way, but I haven’t read any of his work yet to make that statement with much certainty.The Hugo that year went to 
Neuromancer
, and you have to say the better book won in that showdown! But I’m glad that Locus gave it to 

The Integral Trees

, because otherwise this novel could easily have been forgotten over the years and it’s one that I recommended unreservedly as a thoroughly enjoyable little read. Great for a fling – but maybe not one to settle-down with, y’know?I’m pretty sure I’ll cycle back around at some point to read 
A World Out of Time
 and 
Ringworld

Dick - image from the LA Times There is the usual time-tripping here. Pay attention. It is like a LOST episode, and indeed probably inspired some of the concepts used in that estimable show. You need to keep track not only of where you are in space, but in time. The Divine Invasion (no, not a John Waters film) posits a scenario in which god, Yahweh, was essentially booted off planet Earth after the unfortunate events at Masada. Now resident in an alien hill and renamed Yah, (so much classier than Yo!) the big guy is looking to stage a comeback. All he needs is to transport himself, or a version of himself, in the person of a fetus implanted into the womb of a virgin, past the sphere of evil (personified by a critter named Belial) that surrounds Earth. All sorts of religious musing hijinks ensue, wonderings on the nature of consciousness, the Talmud, time and space and whether reality is external to the mind or a manifestation of it. I most enjoyed a conversation between Yah and a feminine counterpart that reminded me of the devil tempting Jesus in the desert. Great fun, but don’t try this unless you are reasonably alert.

We put Eon and Eternity underneath it, and they were exactly the right size to keep it level - they stayed there for several years, until we got around to buying a new couch, and we never had a minute of trouble with them.

Now, I’ll be completely honest with you, while I appreciate the theme of “don’t mess with the ecosystem” and the political intricacies of the book, there is one very, very prominent reason for reading this……GRENDEL.What?When military advisor Cadmann Weyland gets uneasy about animals going missing and fences being torn down he suspects that something is stalking the recently established colony. However, he is promptly ignored and scoffed at by the scientists, who are quick to provide all kinds of facts and reasons why this is implausible.Of course, we all know where this is headed.Where?ShitsvilleLet’s just say, that if they had ever made a film based on this novel, it could potentially have given Aliens a run for its money. What I should point out, however, is that it is also a Hard Science Fiction novel, and the authors provide an interesting and believable scientific basis for everything that happens. And it’s pretty cool, not the kind of thing you and I would have been able to come up with (unless of course, you’re reading this and you’re one of the authors – apologies).Wow!Indeed. The story is well written too, with almost perfect pacing, strong characters and some well-handled human drama and intrigue, to boot. Perhaps it is the nostalgia speaking (it can be a mighty powerful emotion), but this is one for the ages. Don’t bother with the sequel, however.Expect suspense, expect terror, expect the great reveal, expect gosh-wow! Expect bada-boom!Grendel, this one is on you, you magnificently terrifying bastard(s)! Crank up the thrash metal and give it stick!5 starsAdded to favourites;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/899392.The_Legacy_of_Heorot
The Pride of Chanur;C.J. Cherryh;1981;1980;223;3.94;7412;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy', 'Aliens', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space'];When Tully, a fugitive from a spaceship captured by the arrogant, thieving, rodent-like Kif, takes refuge on the Pride of Chanur, a merchant vessel belonging to a clan of the lion-like Hani, Pyanfar Chanur, its captain, gives him shelter, in spite of all the dangers she and her crew will face.;I have complete respect for Cherryh. I've been reading her for almost thirty years and I've made it through most of her novels, but as with most writers and their works, there are a few you can immediately connect with and a few you can't.Don't get me wrong, I think this novel is pretty solid when I think about it in isolation with the rest of Cherryh's work, but I don't think I'd ever call it a classic. It definitely has some really cool elements, however, which is somewhat marred by my enjoyment of her other works (like the Foreigner series)... namely, the first contact and the focus on language, translation, and cultural misunderstandings. Add that to the fact we're reading this entire novel from a lion-like humanoid, it seems like it could be a winner, right?Well, yeah, I suppose it could be... assuming Cherryh hadn't completely outdone herself with Foreigner. :) Or the fact that there were a few weak aspects of the Hani worldbuilding, or Captain Pyanfar herself and her choices... Or the fact I never really got into any of the other characters... Tully the human, included. Even so, there's lots of space action and more alien action. What starts out as a benevolent turn then becomes a huge political disaster for the Hani. It just gets worse when the ramifications threaten to topple the peace between all the aliens in this far-flung corner of space. All in all, I think it is deep-down impressive as a novel of ideas, exploration, and events. It should be mentioned that it connects with the rest of Cherryh's expanded universe, as well.I just wish I had connected more with the characters!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1197129.The_Pride_of_Chanur
A Talent for War;Jack McDevitt;1989;1980;310;3.77;6897;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Mystery', 'Aliens', 'Audiobook', 'Space'];Christopher Sim changed mankind's history forever when he forged a rag-tag group of misfits into the weapon that broke the alien Ashiyyur. But now, one man believes Sim was a fraud, and Alex must follow the legend into the heart of the alien galaxy to confront a truth far stranger than any fiction.;"This just might be some of the most creative Space Opera You've Never Heard Of. Or maybe you follow the Nebulas, the best SF nominated by other SF/F authors, and you recognize that this is fan service for and by the professionals of the field, and so praise from these people usually means that the writer has Talent. Talent for War, or not, I have to agree in pretty much all particulars. What struck me right off the bat was the heavy elements of Mystery lit. It's solid as hell, in fact.It's merely a strange coincidence that there's models for human minds in VR environments, FTL travel, space battles, and quite alien aliens. It doesn't change the fact that this is a good mystery. Murder is only a part of it. It has a much larger scope when it becomes a post-mortem of an old heroic battle full of buried secrets, espionage, and a complete rewriting of our future history. (Or will it be?)We get to relive the past thanks to the future tech, but both portions of the story, whether it's with Alex, our MC, or Sim, the man who would be an iconoclast traitor. Both were fascinating.But what made this space opera really special? The details. There are so many little quirks of the universe thrown in, from classic (and nonexistent) paintings to truly delightful worlds full of hidden mysteries. As an adventure, there's so much to get lost in and wonder about. As a mystery, the details drag you right into the tale and make you believe. :) At least, that's what it did for me. I'm not a huge fan of space opera in general, but I ALWAYS appreciate a smart tale written smartly, and this falls under that category. It isn't overfull with overused tropes, thank the universe, but it may seem slightly slow to some fans of a certain sub-genre of the SF field because it *mostly* reads as a post-mortem on old battles, from tactics to strategy, with all the reversals of fate and the surprising revelations that the ""official"" records have squashed. I clicked with it because I like to dig under the surface of things, too, but in this, it's doubly fascinating because of the sheer amount of layers we get to uncover.It's a work of Imagination and care, and that's no joke.I was warned that I might find this slow, but thankfully, it turned out to be just my speed. :) I'll take depth AND breadth any day. :)";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352774.A_Talent_for_War
Helliconia Spring;Brian W. Aldiss;1982;1980;400;3.62;4329;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook'];A planet orbiting binary suns, Helliconia has a Great Year spanning three millennia of Earth cultures are born in spring, flourish in summer, then die with the onset of the generations-long winter. Helliconia is emerging from its centuries-long winter. The tribes of the equatorial continent emerge from their hiding places and are again able to dispute possession of the planet with the ferocious phagors. In Oldorando, love, trade and coinage are being redisovered, This is the first volume of the Helliconia Trilogy -- a monumental saga that goes beyond anything yet created by this master among today's imaginative writers.;"Helliconia - British author Brian Aldiss' superb creation, science fiction worldbuilding comparable to Frank Herbert's Dune, or, if you like, in the world of fantasy, comparable to J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings. Helliconia Spring - the first volume in the trilogy. The other two volumes are Helliconia Summer and Helliconia Winter. Take a look at the below diagram. Helliconia is a planet revolving around its sun Batalix as Batalix revolves around larger sun Frayr in an elliptical orbit. The consequence of Helliconia being either closer to or more distant from Frayr results in a particular season - spring, summer, winter - lasting for centuries. This Frayr-Batalix binary sun solar system is within our Milky Way but thousands of light years away. Survival on Helliconia centers around the Darwinian struggle for supremacy between humans and phagors. A word on each species: Humans, sort ofUnlike humans on Earth where you are either alive or dead, on Helliconia, once humans leave their bodies, they descend into a pitch-black realm to become first gossies and then with the passage of more time, fessups. All living humans can communicate with the gossies when they, the living humans, enter a trance state called pauk. Phagors Built like big, powerful professional wrestlers, phagors walk human-style on their two hind legs and speak their own language. Phagor heads are like mountain goats with two lethal horns; shaggy white fur and antifreeze-like blood make phagors impervious to the bitter cold. Phagoes fight ferociously with swords and spears; phagors take humans as slaves and some phagors ride huge horse-like beasts called kaidaws. Climate Alas, in many critical ways, there's a third major player in the cycles of life on Helliconia: the weather itself. Can you imagine what the planet must be like during those hundreds of years of Siberia-like subzero ice and snow? And how about those other hundreds of years when Helliconia moves closer to Fraya and the surface of the planet turns into tropical jungles and scorching deserts? Then there are those hundreds of transitional spring-like years where summer-dominating humans and winter-dominating phagors continually battle it out. Brian Aldiss builds the world of Helliconia Sping methodically, in carefully elaborated detail over the course of 450 pages. This to say, the novel requires a bit of time and energy but once I began to immerse myself in Aldiss' creation, I gladly returned to the book again and again. As part of his worldbuilding, Aldiss explores myth and religion, anthropology and sociology, landscape and architecture, gender and class. Helliconia Spring begins with an extensive Prelude where we follow Yuri, a young hunter from a tribe of hunters (think of Jean M. Auel's The Clan of the Cave Bear) as he makes his way to the city of Pannoval, a city having much in common with one of our first prehistoric cities along the banks of the Euphrates in Mesopotamia. ""He breathed deep as he got his first sight of Pannoval.Ahead was a great cliff, so steep that no snow clung to it. In the cliff face was carved an enormous representation of Akha the Great One. Akha squatted in a traditional attitude, knees near his shoulders, arms wrapped round his knees, hands locked palms upward, with the sacred flame of life in his palms. His head was large, topped with a knot of hair. His half-human face struck terror into a beholder. There was awe even in his cheeks. Yet his great almond eyes were bland, and there was serenity as well as ferocity to be read in that upturned mouth and those majestic eyebrows.Beside his left foot, and dwarfed by it, was an opening in the rock. Yuri saw that this mouth was itself gigantic, possibly three times taller than a man."" Yuri remains in Pannoval and even subjects himself to rigorous training in order to become one of the city's priests. But you just can't keep a hunter tribesman down - forever his own man and a lover of freedom, Yuri sickens of the whole domesticated rule-bound society and his role as priest. Along with three companions, Yuri flees the city, ventures forth across mountains and planes to establish the priest-free community of Oldorando. The bulk of Aldiss' novel picks up 50 years later in Oldorando. Yuri is long dead but the men and women still live mostly in The Clan of the Cave Bear-style until, decades later, new discoveries and innovations transform Oldorando into a medieval-like village complete with guilds and tradespeople, new fabrics and fashions, writing and books, even an academy of science run by women. Every week Helliconia undergoes a further winter thaw. Ah, springtime! Although one could write a short book on all the happenings, I'll simply bullet the following to serve as a taste test: Flora and FaunaMany species of our animals and plants are found in Helliconia, including pigs and sheep, boars and dogs, geese and blackbirds, bats, lice and mosquitoes. Additionally, a number of unique creatures roam the land such as a giant worm with wings. Social Strata Oldorando has its leaders and lieutenants, hunters and craftsmen, and there are also slaves, not only humans (usually captured from outlining tribes) but as the phagors take human slaves, so humans have their phagor slaves. In Oldorando, there's old Myk, a phagor that has never known freedom, a phagor taken captive by humans at birth. Among Myk's duties through the years once he reached maturity: giving human children rides on his big, broad furry back. Space Station Observatory Halfway through the novel, we discover there are researchers from Earth orbiting Helliconia in an enormous space station called Avernus. As much as the researchers on board would love to go down to the planet's surface, even pay a visit to Oldorando (wouldn't that be fun!), unfortunately, such a trip would be a death-sentence since our immune system could never handle deadly Helliconian microbes. Meanwhile, Back on Planet EarthAll of the information about Helliconian life is transmitted back to Earth - including actual photos and film footage of human interaction within Oldorando and phagors riding across the planes. Universities compile encyclopedias; theaters show Helliconia feature films; computer programmers create entertaining games (natch) simulating all aspects of Helliconian life - one blockbuster: battles between humans and phagors. The Big PictureOf course, the prime question looms: will humans accumulate enough knowledge and recorded history so when the next cycle unfolds and Helliconian Winter turns into the next Helliconian Spring, humans can benefit from the previous spring's accomplishments. In other words, will humans learn from the past or must they begin again at Clan of the Cave Bear cultural ground zero? So exciting. I'm all set to find out in Helliconia Summer and Helliconia Winter. Who knows, maybe the Helliconian humans might even have some help from Earth humans. If so, then those monstrous phagors are in for a big shock.British author Brian Aldiss, 1925-2017";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/672244.Helliconia_Spring
The Giver;Lois Lowry;1993;1990;208;4.12;2556796;yes;['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'School'];At the age of twelve, Jonas, a young boy from a seemingly utopian, futuristic world, is singled out to receive special training from The Giver, who alone holds the memories of the true joys and pain of life.;"Lowry's book is a piece of nationalist propaganda, using oversimplification, emotional appeals, and dualistic morality to shut down her readers' minds. More troubling is that it is aimed at children, who don't yet have the critical faculties to defend themselves from such underhanded methods.Unsurprisingly, Lowry adopts the structure of the monomyth, equating a spiritual journey with a moral one. Her Christ-figure uses literal magic powers to rebel against his society. This rebellion and the morality behind it are presented as 'natural', to contrast with the 'abnormal morality' around him.Lowry doesn't seem to understand that we get our morality from our culture, it isn't something in-born that we 'lose'. This is the first hint of Lowry's misunderstanding of the human mind. She assumes her own morality is correct, and then builds her story to fit it.She also makes the character act and think like a modern person would, despite never adequately explaining how he came up with such unusual notions. It's the same trick many historical fiction authors use, leaving us scratching our heads as to why a Fourteenth Century French peasant speaks like a second-wave feminist. I'd suggest that Lowry falls to this fault for the same reason they do: she has no talent for imagining how others might think differently.Lowry's book ends with the standard nonspecific transgressive spiritual event that marks any overblown monomyth. Since the book is not a progressive presentation of ideas, it does not suggest any conclusion. Instead, the climax is a symbolic faux-death event (symbolic of what, none can say). Confusingly, Lowry later redacts the ending in the sequels, undermining the pseudo-spiritual journey she created.Though some call this book 'Dystopian', it's closer to the truth to say Lowry borrows elements from the Dystopian authors, attempting to combine the spiritual uplift of the monomyth with the political and social deconstruction of the Dystopia. What she doesn't recognize is that the faith of the one conflicts with the cynicism of the other. She draws on ideas and images from many other authors: Bradbury, Huxley, Orwell, Burgess, but doesn't improve upon them.These authors created novels that reflected the world around them. They based them on the political events of the times, presented with realism and careful psychology. Though they presented the struggle between the individual and the society, they portrayed morality as grey, and suffering as the result of individual human faults, not political systems. Lowry doesn't realize that the best way to critique Fascism or Communism is not to present it as 'evil', but to simply present it as it was.But Lowry's world is not based in reality, it is symbolic and hyperbolic. Instead of writing about how poverty makes the world seem small and dull, she has the characters magically unable to experience life. Instead of an impersonal government, she presents a sort of evil hippy commune. The only political system it resembles is a school, which is a neat little trick to get the kids interested. The idea that 'school=unfeeling totalitarian hell' is not an uncommon one, but it's one I'm surprised teachers would support. The book also suggests a creche, but lacking similarity to any real-world system, it doesn't work as a political criticism.Lowry creates this artificial world to suit her purposes, but it is not a symbolic exercise like 'Animal Farm'. We understand that the pigs of animal farm are symbolic, because there are no talking pigs. Lowry's world is more insidious, since its oversimplification is hidden. She builds an artificial world to support the dualist morality that she's pushing. She presents the same knee-jerk fears about euthanasia and abortion that people use against Women's Rights or Health Care.Worse than these Straw Man arguments is the fact that she never deals with the economic causes of totalitarianism. Tyrants don't just rise up and take control by their own force of will, they come into power because of the socioeconomic situations that surround them. Lean times produce strong, fascist leaders while profitable times produce permissive, liberal societies.Strong, centralized leadership simply doesn't self-propagate in cultures where everyone is clothed, fed, and housed. The Holocaust was socially about some ideal of 'change' and 'purity', but it was economically about the transmission of wealth from Jews, Poles, and Catholics to Germans (and more specifically, to those Germans who had elected the new ruling party).The atrocities of war are, for the most part, committed by normal people on other normal people. By presenting the power structure as 'amoral' and 'inhuman', Lowry ignores the fact that people will willingly cause others to suffer. Painting the enemy as 'evil' and 'alien' is just an unsophisticated propagandist method.She contrasts her 'evil' with the idealized 'goodness' of emotion, beauty, and freedom. This is nothing more than the American dream of 'specialness' that Mr. Rogers was pushing for so many years. We are all special, we are all good, we all deserve love and happiness. Sure, it sounds good, but what does it mean?Where does this 'specialness' come from? If it is just the 'sanctity of human life', then it's not really special, because it's all-encompassing. If all of us are special, then none of us are. There's nothing wrong with valuing life, but when Lowry presents one mode of life as valuable and another as reprehensible, she ceases to actually value humanity as a whole. Instead, she values a small, idealized chunk of humanity. 'People are good, except the ones I don't like' is not a moral basis, nor is it a good message to send to kids.If the specialness is only based on fitting in with a certain moral and social guideline, then Lowry isn't praising individuality, she's praising herd behavior. The protagonist is only 'special' because he has magic powers. His specialness is not a part of his character, it is an emotional appeal.The idea of being a special individual is another piece of propaganda, and its one kids are especially prone to, because kids aren't special: they are carefully controlled and powerless. Giving a character special powers and abilities and then using that character to feed a party line to children is not merely disingenuous, it's disturbing.There is also a darker side to universal specialness: giving a child a sense of importance without anything to back it up creates egotism and instability. Adults noticed that children with skills and friends had high self-esteems, but instead of teaching their children social skills and knowledge, they misunderstood the causal relationship and tried to give them self-worth first.Unfortunately, the moment unsupported self-worth is challenged, the child finds they have nothing to fall back on. Their entitlement didn't come from their skills or experiences, and so they have nothing to bolster that sense of worth. Instead, any doubt sends them down a spiral of emotional instability.A single book like this wouldn't be the cause of such a state in a child, but it does act as part of the social structure built to give a sense of worth without a solid base for that worth. People like to believe they are special, kids especially so, but being a remarkable person is not a result of belief but of actions. If the book had informed them, then it would leave them better off, but giving them a conclusion based on emotional appeals does nothing to build confidence or character.Many people have told me this book is good because it appeals to children, but children often fall for propaganda. Children develop deep relationships with pop stars, breakfast cereals, and Japanese monsters. This does not make them good role models for children.Feeding 'specialness' to kids along with a political message is no better than the fascist youth programs Lowry intends to criticize. The obsession with individuality is just another form of elitism. It's ironic that people in America most often describe themselves as individuals when pointing out the things they do to align themselves with groups.But banding together in a community is not a bad thing. For Lowry and other 'Red Scare' children, any mention of 'communal' can turn into a witch hunt, but we all give up some personal rights and some individuality in order to live in relatively safe, structured societies. There are benefits to governmental social controls and there are drawbacks, and it's up to us to walk the line between the two. Anarchy and Totalitarianism never actually exist for long: we are social animals.It's not difficult to understand why Lowry is so popular, especially amongst educators. The message she gives aligns perfectly with what they were taught as kids, from Red Scare reactionism to the hippy-dippy 'unique snowflake' mantra. These ideas aren't entirely misguided, either. It's good to recognize the benefits of difference and the dangers of allowing other to control our lives.If a reader believes that fascism and socialism are inherently wrong and that their own individuality is their greatest asset, they will likely sympathize with Lowry's work. However, this doesn't make the book honest, nor beneficial. One of the hardest things we can do as readers is disagree with the methods of authors we agree with ideologically.It makes us feel good to find authors who agree with us, but this is when we should be at our most skeptical. Searching the world for self-justification is not a worthwhile goal, it simply turns you into another short-sighted, argumentative know-it-all. 'Yes men' never progress.Lowry is toeing the party line. She does not base her book around difficult questions, like the Dystopian authors, but around easy answers. She doesn't force the reader to decide for themselves what is best, she makes it clear what she wants us to think. Her book is didactic, which means that it instructs the reader what to believe.Even if her conclusions about Individuality vs. Community are correct, she doesn't present arguments, she only presents conclusions. Like rote memorization or indoctrination, she teaches nothing about the politics, social order, economics, or psychology of totalitarianism or individuality. The reader is not left with an understanding, just an opinion.The baseless 'individuality' of the book lets the reader imagine that they are rebels--that they are bucking the system even as they fall into lock-step. By letting the reader think they are already free-thinking, Lowry tricks them into forgetting their skepticism.She is happy to paint a simple world of black and white, and this is likely the world she sees. I doubt she is purposefully creating an insidious text, she just can't see past her own opinions. She writes this book with a point to make, and makes it using emotional appeals and symbolism. She doesn't back it up with arguments because she doesn't seem to have developed her opinions from cogent arguments.In the end, she doesn't show us that the structure of this society is wrong, she says nothing poignant about individuality vs. community; instead, she relies on threats to the life of an innocent infant. Yet nowhere does she provide an argument for why communal living or the sacrifice of freedoms for safety must necessarily lead to infanticide.In politics, making extreme claims about the opposing side is called mud-slinging, it is an underhanded and dishonest tactic. It works. Arguing intelligently is difficult, accusing is easy, so that's what Lowry does.She is another child of WWII and the Cold War who hasn't learned her lesson. She quickly condemns the flaws of others while failing to search out her own. Even after the Holocaust, there are many racist, nationalist, violent Jews; conflict rarely breeds a new understanding.America condemned the faceless communal life of the Second World, and yet America created The Projects. We critiqued strong governmental controls, but we still have the bank bailout, socialized medicine, socialized schooling, and socialized charity. America condemned the Gulags and Work Camps, and yet we imprison one out of every hundred citizens; far more than Stalin ever did. Some are killed, all are dehumanized.As a little sci fi adventure, the book isn't terrible. It's really the pretension that goes along with it. Lowry cobbles together religious symbolism and Dystopic tropes and then tries to present it as something as complex and thoughtful as the authors she copied. Copying isn't a crime, but copying poorly is.Like Dan Brown or Michael Crichton, she creates a political pamphlet of her own ideals, slaps a pretense of authority on it, and then waits for the money and awards to roll in--and they did. Many people I've discussed this book with have pointed to those awards as the surest sign of this book's eminent worth.Award committees are bureaucratic organizations. Their decisions are based on political machinations. This book is a little piece of Nationalism, and so it was lauded by the political machine that Lowry supports. The left hand helps the right. If awards are the surest sign of worth, then Titanic is a better movie than Citizen Kane.What surprises me is how many of those who brought up the award as their argument were teachers. If a politically-charged administrative committee is the best way to teach children, then why do you take umbrage when the principal tells you that bigger class sizes (and fewer benefits) are fine? Listen to him: doesn't he have award plaques?The other argument is usually that 'kids like it'. I usually respond that kids also like candy, so why not teach that? Some people also get angry at me for analyzing a book written for children:""Of course it's not a great book, it's for kids! If you want a good book, go read Ulysses!""I prefer to give children good books rather than pieces of political propaganda (even if they agreed with me). Children can be as skeptical, quick-witted, and thoughtful as adults if you give them the chance, so I see no excuse for feeding them anything less. Kids aren't stupid, they just lack knowledge, and that's a fine distinction. It's easy for adults to take advantage of their naivete, their emotionality, and their sense of worth. Just because it's easier for the teacher doesn't mean it's better for the child.When we show children something that is over-simplified, presenting an idealized, crudely moralizing world, we aren't preparing them for the actual world. If you give a child a meaningless answer to repeat, he will repeat it, but he won't understand why. Why not give the child a book that presents many complex ideas, but no rote answers, and let them make up their own minds? If they don't learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff and form their own opinions early, in a safe, nurturing environment, what chance will they have on their own as adults?In all the discussions and research regarding this book, I have come across very little analysis. It's especially surprising for a book with such a strong following, but there aren't many explanations of why the book is supposed to be useful or important.This lack of argument makes sense from a political standpoint, since there is no reason to analyze the worth of propaganda: its worth is that it agrees with society and indoctrinates readers. Analyzing it would defeat the purpose; political diatribes do not stand up to thoughtful attention.Perhaps someday someone will create a thoughtful, textual analysis of this book that will point out its merits, its structure and its complexity. I've gradually come to doubt it. I never expected when I wrote my original review of this book that it would garner this much attention.I still welcome comments and thoughts, but if your comment looks roughly like this: ""You should read this book again, but this time, like it more. You think you're smart but you aren't. You're mean. Lowry is great. This book won awards and kids like it. It's meant for kids anyways, why would you analyze what its about? I bet you never even read the sequels. Go read 'Moby Dick' because you are full of yourself.""I've heard that one before.

C'mon, what sort of man is going to pass up some sweet, sweet lovin' from his woman before disappearing on a mystery mission? The kind who likes other men, that's what kind. A handful of pages later, it becomes clear that Dan Brown has read too many Clive Cussler novels as we're treated to a description of David Becker:""Becker was dark--a rugged, youthful thirty-five with sharp green eyes and a wit to match. His strong jaw and taut features reminded Susan of carved marble. Over six feet tall, Becker moved across a squash court faster than any of his colleagues could comprehend. After soundly beating his opponent, he would cool off by dousing his head in a drinking fountain and soaking his tuft of thick, black hair. Then, still dripping, he'd treat his opponent to a fruit shake and a bagel.""Is it just me or does this read like Dan Brown was typing this with one hand? Why does Mr. Stud have the same initials as the author? Why would anyone want a sharp green wit? And is 'fruit shake' some sort of code for a handy? Is that why he is still dripping?So then, after all this ran through my immature little mind, I remembered I had other books to read--books that didn't suck horrifically within the first ten pages. Yay for other books!Oh, and I sold it to a used book shop for a dollar, so it was worth the quarter. Yay for used book shops!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11125.Digital_Fortress

Authorities confine the blind to an empty mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations, and assaulting women. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides her charges—among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears—through the barren streets, and their procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. As Blindness reclaims the age-old story of a plague, it evokes the vivid and trembling horrors of the twentieth century, leaving readers with a powerful vision of the human spirit that's bound both by weakness and exhilarating strength.";"""الأكثر رعبا من العمي .. هو أن تكون الوحيد الذي يري""وهذه رواية ربما ستُغير رؤيتك للعالم..للأبد

Snow Crash;Neal Stephenson;1992;1990;576;4.02;284604;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Dystopia'];"The ""brilliantly realized"" (The New York Times Book Review) modern classic that coined the term ""metaverse""--one of Time's 100 best English-language novels and ""a foundational text of the cyberpunk movement"" (Wired), now in a gorgeous new hardcover edition featuring bonus materialIn reality, Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo's CosoNostra Pizza Inc., but in the Metaverse he's a warrior prince. Plunging headlong into the enigma of a new computer virus that's striking down hackers everywhere, he races along the neon-lit streets on a search-and-destroy mission for the shadowy virtual villain threatening to bring about infocalypse. Snow Crash is a mind-altering romp through a future America so bizarre, so outrageous . . . you'll recognize it immediately.";"Disliking this book seemed quite impossible. After all, it had all the necessary ingredients: the pervasive air of nerdy geekiness (or, perhaps, geeky nerdiness), an unexpected take on linguistics, a kick-ass female character, a parallel (virtual) reality, a hefty helping of (admittedly, overexaggerated) satire, and just enough wacky improbable worldbuilding to satisfy my book loving soul. Or so it seemed.But awesome ingredients do not always add up to a satisfying dish¹ (as my horrible cook self knows much too well).¹Remember 'Friends' episode where Rachel tries to make English trifle for Thanksgiving desert, but because of a couple pages unfortunately sticking together ends up making half English trifle and half the shepherd's pie? Joey was baffled that the rest of the gang found the dish unpalatable:'I mean, what's not to like? Custard, good. Jam, good. Meat, good!'
I did NOT come to this book with an open mind. I came to it infinitely biased in its favor, ready to love it to pieces, prepared to find in it the same irresistible allure that so many of my Goodreads friends appreciated. Alas, after the first few pages my good-natured amusement gave way to irritated frustration, then to impatience, and eventually, as the book was nearing its final pages, my feelings changed to dreaded passionless indifference - akin to the emotions stirred by a disclaimer on the back of a pill packet.It is very disappointing when a book leaves you indifferent after hundreds of pages spent with the characters and the plotlines - especially when it is a book with such immense potential as 'Snow Crash' had based on all the reviews and snippets I have seen, with all the ingredients for an amazing sci-fi adventure I listed above.
“We are all susceptible to the pull of viral ideas. Like mass hysteria. Or a tune that gets into your head that you keep humming all day until you spread it to someone else. Jokes. Urban legends. Crackpot religions. Marxism. No matter how smart we get, there is always this deep irrational part that makes us potential hosts for self-replicating information.” 
Here's a glimpse of the plot, as much as I can listlessly muster. Hiro Protagonist, our hero and protagonist (cleverly annoying or annoyingly clever, I'm not quite sure) is a hacker in a future completely corporatized and fractured by consumerism America. He delivers pizza for the Mafia franchise by day and in his spare time hangs around Metaverse, a computer-based simulated reality where he is a sword-fighting badass with a juicy piece of expensive (virtual) real estate and important friends. To those having trouble picturing this, think of ‘The Matrix’ as compared to the gloomy existence outside of it. Y. T. is his sidekick, a Kourier with a healthy dose of vital spunk and kindness to animals that just may result in the most spectacular payback at the most crucial moment. Uncle Enzo is the head of the Mafia franchise, and does not like late pizza deliveries - he has his reasons. As for the antagonists, we have L. Ron Hubbard L. Bob Rife, a computer magnate and a leader of a questionable religion; the Feds that have lost their power but retained their bureaucracy; and enigmatic Raven, equipped with a motorcycle, a few deadly spears and another weapon that earns him more respect from the authorities that that a few small nations get.And then there's the titular Snow Crash:
“This Snow Crash thing--is it a virus, a drug, or a religion?” Juanita shrugs. “What's the difference?” 
Sounds awesome, doesn't it? To me, the concept of Snow Crash initially evoked the memories of Delany's Babel-17, a book that I loved for all it's strangeness and far-fetchedness and irresistible pull into the blend of linguistics and sci-fi. 

But then 'Snow Crash', having barely taken off, disappointingly crashed. Pun very much intended.Maybe this had something to do with the clumsily thrown in heaps of infodump, painfully interrupting already shaky and unsteady narrative, adding tons of poorly placed and far-fetched exposition which it mistakes for layers of complexity, basking in self-importance while being needlessly silly (and, frankly, needless). Maybe it was the sheer number of complex plot threads that weaves complexity but ended up going nowhere, with few (admittedly, memorable) exceptions.Maybe it was what I can only perceive as casual racism so pervasive in descriptions of most 'ethnic' characters and entire groups featured in this novel, so present in every casually thrown stereotype. Intentional or not, it was unpleasantly grating.Maybe it was the lack of dimension in Stephenson's characters. Hiro appears to be created as an embodiment of a teenage computer whiz's dreams, not developing in the slightest throughout the novel, only acquiring more and more badassery in the throwaway 'why not?' sloppy manner. Y.T., despite her awesomeness², behaving in a strangely robotic fashion. Raven and Uncle Enzo, frustratingly underdeveloped. Juanita, whose character could have been interesting, appears to exist solely as potential mate for Hiro. The only times I felt any connection to the characters were the appearances of the robotic dog, and I am not even a dog person. ² Y.T., while being far from an excellent character, was at least a ray of (grumpy) sunshine in the otherwise grey landscape of this novel. She has spunk and heart and confidence that is engaging and does not strike fakes notes that often. She made me almost care, and for this I appreciate her character. If only the rest if the book had the same spirit...Maybe it was the inability to interweave the plot threads into a coherent storyline, to create a bigger whole out of separate parts. The ideas are there, the concepts are there; what's missing is cohesiveness able to pull them together, untangle them and weave a net captivating the readers' brains and imagination. Without this cohesiveness, even the wildest and most daring ideas - like Stephenson's unconventional approach to viruses, for instance - remain disjointed, underdeveloped, unfinished, unpolished, like the refugee Raft in his novel, made of heaps of refuse clumped together trying to make a whole but failing at it.Honestly, I can't help but see how this book would have worked so much better in a graphic format, being it a comic book (like, apparently, it was initially envisioned) or a film; the action scenes would have looked splendid while the awkwardness of language with overused frequently clumsy metaphors and the jarring present tense (which really doesn't work for this story) would have been cast aside. -----------Yes, I am very disappointed at my disappointment with this book. I wish I had the ability to overlook its flaws, but the indifference I felt when reading it precluded me from caring enough to let its good moments overshadow the bad. 2 stars, one for the robot-doggy and another for Y.T. who occasionally made me almost care.——————Also posted on my blog.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61240297-snow-crash

Butler;1993;1990;345;4.21;183115;yes;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Post Apocalyptic'];In 2024, with the world descending into madness and anarchy, one woman begins a fateful journey toward a better future.Lauren Olamina and her family live in one of the only safe neighborhoods remaining on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Behind the walls of their defended enclave, Lauren’s father, a preacher, and a handful of other citizens try to salvage what remains of a culture that has been destroyed by drugs, disease, war, and chronic water shortages. While her father tries to lead people on the righteous path, Lauren struggles with hyperempathy, a condition that makes her extraordinarily sensitive to the pain of others.When fire destroys their compound, Lauren’s family is killed and she is forced out into a world that is fraught with danger. With a handful of other refugees, Lauren must make her way north to safety, along the way conceiving a revolutionary idea that may mean salvation for all mankind.;I am embarrassed to say I had never read Octavia Butler before. I’m happy I finally corrected this glaring oversight. This novel set in the near future is so frighteningly prescient it is difficult to read. The year is 2026. American society is rapidly breaking down thanks to global warning, economic stagnation and wealth disparity. 18-year-old Lauren Olamina lives with her family in a walled-off middle class neighborhood outside LA, but she knows that their little island of relative safety will not last. No one can leave the compound without risking their lives. People are desperate and bereft of any hope. Police and fire fighters only come to help if you have the money to pay them, and even then they are more likely to arrest you than assist you. Few jobs pay money. Most people are slipping into de facto slavery as servants to the wealthy or employees in company-run towns. The new president promises to “Make America Great Again,” — sound familiar? — but does so by eliminating the space program and loosening all labor protections, which only gives large corporations a freer hand in cutting up the carcass of the United States.Lauren is born with a dangerous condition, hyper-empathy, which means she feels whatever pain she witnesses inflicted on others. When her neighborhood is finally breached and she is forced out into the harsh new world, this empathy is only one of her great challenges. Lauren has an idea for a new kind of society — a new religion that will teach self-sufficiency and a new understanding of what God is — but to realize her dream, she first has to stay alive and learn who she can trust.This book was written in the 90s. The scary thing is — the 2026 Butler imagined twenty years ago could easily happen within ten years. Reading this book, I felt a growing sense of claustrophobia, as if I were already trapped in Butler’s disintegrating vision of America. It is a haunting, powerful read, but not for the faint of heart.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52397.Parable_of_the_Sower

I'm helping. I'm watching. But I'm free. Because it's Ender's game.”2021: Another fantastic reading of Ender's Shadow! I'm hoping to find time to continue on with Ender's Saga. Not sure if this was my third or fourth read of Ender's Shadow. Couldn't believe I had never reviewed it (or some of the other Ender books I reread this year). So I really enjoyed this book, which is a parallel novel of Ender's Game. And if you're wondering, I would be on Team Bean. I prefer the Ender sequels, but Bean's story of Battleschool and the war with the Formics is more compelling than Ender's version (in my opinion). That said, Ender's Shadow, Ender's Game (and the Ender's Game Series) are well worth the read. Even though the protagonists are very young (especially Bean), this novel connects lots of issues with good storytelling.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9532.Ender_s_Shadow
The Lost World;Michael Crichton;1995;1990;448;3.85;160270;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Adventure', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Dinosaurs'];It is now six years since the secret disaster at Jurassic Park, six years since the extraordinary dream of science and imagination came to a crashing end—the dinosaurs destroyed, the park dismantled, the island indefinitely closed to the public. There are rumors that something has survived....;"I find a lot of people discuss the ""resurrection"" of Ian Malcolm in their reviews, and I'd like to throw in my two cents. It's true, Malcolm is mentioned as dead at the end of Jurassic Park. To be exact, Muldoon is telling Grant what's happened to everyone else as they're flying away in the helicopter: ""What about Malcolm?"" Grant said. Muldoon shook his head.The epilogue mentions the Costa Rican government not permitting the burial of John Hammond or Ian Malcolm (amongst a list of other ways they dragged their feet and covered things up). But that's it.My point is this: it's not as if Crichton tricked us by delivering a long death scene where Ian Malcolm said his last goodbyes and made some final point about evolution and chaos theory - then got lazy and just reintroduced Malcolm into the next book. Malcolm's ""death"" in JP was not seen, and only vaguely mentioned (unlike every other major character who died in the book). Also, the explanation given in The Lost World as to why the others thought he was dead was completely plausible - he was simply so close to death that he was left for dead.I'll get off of my soapbox now. For me, The Lost World was a satisfying and exciting read. I think I read it in about a day and a half the first time, and I've re-read it a few times since.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8650.The_Lost_World

The Fall of Hyperion;Dan Simmons;1990;1990;517;4.23;131284;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Time Travel'];In the stunning continuation of the epic adventure begun in Hyperion, Simmons returns us to a far future resplendent with drama and invention. On the world of Hyperion, the mysterious Time Tombs are opening. And the secrets they contain mean that nothing--nothing anywhere in the universe--will ever be the same.;"""Nurse, this patient’s chart is very confusing.”“Which patient, Doctor?”“Uh..Mr. Kemper. He’s the one in the vegetative state.”“Oh, that’s a very sad and odd case.”“According to the patient history, he was admitted a few weeks ago with cerebrospinal fluid leaking from his nose and ears, but it seemed like he should recover. But yesterday he was brought in again, barely conscious and then he lapsed into a coma. The really odd thing is that I see no signs of injury or disease.”“That’s right, Doctor. It was a book that did this to Mr. Kemper.”“A book? How is that possible?”“From what we can figure out, the first incident occured after he read Hyperion by a writer named Dan Simmons. I guess it’s one of those sci-fi books and apparently the story is quite elaborate. Anyhow, Mr. Kemper had read Simmons before and knew he likes to put a lot of big ideas in his books. But this time, apparently Simmons broke into his house and managed to directly implant much of the book directly into Mr. Kemper’s brain via some kind of crude funnel device.”“I find that highly unlikely, Nurse.”“Most of us did, Doctor. But Mr. Kemper kept insisting that Simmons had some kind of grudge against him. He even had a note he said Simmons had left that said something like ‘Don’t you ever learn? If you keep reading my books, I’ll end you someday.’”“Assuming that I believed this story, I guess that Kemper’s current state tells us that he didn’t heed the warning?”“Apparently not, Doctor. His wife said she found him having convulsions and leaking brain matter out his nose and ears again. A copy of the sequel, The Fall of Hyperion was on the floor nearby.”“I can’t believe that reading a silly sci-fi book could turn an healthy man into a turnip, Nurse.”“Well, when they brought Kemper in, he was semiconscious and muttering. Someone wrote it down. Let see, he kept repeating words and phrases like: Shrike, Time Tombs, the Core, God, uh…no, two gods actually, farcasters, Ousters, religion, pope, death wand, space battles, interplanetary trees, old Earth, AI, mega sphere, data sphere, The Canterbury Tales, poetry, John Keats, Tree of Thorns, and Lord of Pain.”“Jesus! What does all that mean?”“Someone looked it up on the web and all of that is actually in the book.”“That poor bastard. No wonder his gray matter is fried. No one could absorb all that without permanent damage.”“Yes, I’d think that book should have some kind of warning sticker or something on it.”“One thing I still don’t understand, Nurse. If Kemper knew that this book would probably do this to him, why did he still read it?”“I guess he had told several people that Hyperion was just so good that he had to know how it ended, even if it killed him.”***************************************I think the word ‘epic’ was invented to describe this book.What Simmons began in Hyperion finishes here with a story so sprawling and massive that it defies description. In the far future, humanity has spread to the stars, and maintains a web of worlds via ‘farcasters’. (Think Stargates.) On the planet Hyperion, mysterious tombs have been moving backwards in time and are guarded by the deadly Shrike.Seven people were sent to Hyperion on a ‘pilgrimage’ that was almost certainly a suicide mission, but the Ousters, a segment of humanity evolving differently after centuries spent in deep space, are about to invade. The artificial intelligences of the Core that humanity depends on for predictions of future events and management of the farcaster system can’t tell what’s coming with an unknown like the Shrike and Hyperion in play.Battles rage across space and time and the virtual reality of the data sphere as varying interests with competing agendas maneuver and betray each other as the pilgrims on Hyperion struggle to survive and finally uncover the secrets of the Shrike. But the real reasons behind the war and it’s ultimate goal are bigger and more sinister than anyone involved can imagine.I can’t say enough good things about the story told in these first two Hyperion books. This is sci-fi at it’s best with a massive story crammed with big unique ideas and believable characters you care about. Any one of the pieces could have made a helluva book, but it takes a talent like Simmons to pull all of it together into one coherent story.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77565.The_Fall_of_Hyperion
Among the Hidden;Margaret Peterson Haddix;1998;1990;153;3.99;126733;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Childrens', 'Fantasy'];SHADOW CHILDRENLuke has never been to school. He's never had a birthday party, or gone to a friend's house for an overnight. In fact, Luke has never had a friend.Luke is one of the shadow children, a third child forbidden by the Population Police. He's lived his entire life in hiding, and now, with a new housing development replacing the woods next to his family's farm, he is no longer even allowed to go outside.Then, one day Luke sees a girl's face in the window of a house where he knows two other children already live. Finally, he's met a shadow child like himself. Jen is willing to risk everything to come out of the shadows - does Luke dare to become involved in her dangerous plan? Can he afford not to?;"I am adding this book as a warning. The first book and a half are very interesting and the plot is fascinating. DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THESE BOOKS!! Somewhere in the second book, it begins to get quite violent. By the fourth or fifth book, there is holocaust-type violence, children killing in cold blood, and outrageous examples of treachery and hate. These books are dangerous, as the first one is so good. Please use caution when you give your children books to read. I learned the hard way to read all of a series before you recommend them whole-heartedly to a child.Post Script: I'm amazed at all the responses I got to this review. When I wrote it, 13 years ago, my older kids were just learning to read and my youngest kids were babies. I was teaching middle schoolers at a private school in a very conservative town and I was thinking hard about what was ""appropriate"" for a child to read or not. I had really strong opinions at the time.My strong opinions have swung far in the opposite direction since then. If a child is interested in a book like this, or even something else, have at it! I loved the suggestion from one mom about reading the book together with their child. Fabulous! The only point to be made here now is that the first book in the series wasn't as violent, but then the series gets much more intense, so if your child is sensitive (like I was as a kid), you might pay attention if they need guidance or to be told it's okay to put down a book or maybe just an extra hug?Read on!

Cryptonomicon;Neal Stephenson;1999;1990;1152;4.24;113389;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Thriller', 'Historical', 'War'];"Cryptonomicon zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods—World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. ""When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty—we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.""All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes—inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe—team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.";"Disclaimer: Had Mr. Stephenson been more skillful in his prose/characterization/writing in general, I would not have paid nearly as much attention to the following issues. I read a lot of old dead white guy type literature, and am pretty forgiving so long as it's good. If it isn't, well, this happens. That is all.Do not be fooled by the static nature of the star count above. If I had my way, it would be a roiling maelstrom of a typhoon crashing into lava, erosion and explosion steaming and spilling into a chemical equilibrium of monstrous proportions. It would be a much more appropriate way of symbolizing that there were parts of this that I loved immensely and others that still cause my vision to go red whenever I think on them for too long. However, as that is not a possibility without my use of GIFs to illustrate my point (Two words: Never. Ever.), you'll have to take my more long-winded approach to the matter.Mr. Stephenson is the type of character that, if allowed onto a college campus, should be kept safe and locked away in the mathematics department. The physics department is a possibility, and computer science perhaps, maybe even biology, but the decreased removal from reality present in these areas increases the risk that this individual poses. This isn't a man you want teaching a history class or, god forbid, one of literature. Unless the literature class is completely devoted to math fiction (Or is it fanfiction? Not sure about that one), because every so often something gorgeous happens. 
If he would just work with pure ideas like a proper mathematician he could go as fast as thought. As it happens, Alan has become fascinated by the incarnations of pure ideas in the physical world. The underlying math of the universe is like the light streaming in through the window. Alan is not satisfied with merely knowing that it streams in. He blows smoke into the air to make the light visible. He sits in meadows gazing at pine cones and flowers, tracing the mathematical patterns in their structure, and he dreams about electron winds blowing over the glowing filaments and screens of radio tubes, and, in their surges and eddies, capturing something of what is going on in his own brain. Turing is neither a mortal nor a good. He is Antaeus. That he bridges the mathematical and physical worlds is his strength and his weakness.
And that is the closest Mr. Stephenson gets to melding together beautiful prose with stunning mathematical dexterity. If he stuck with that, this review would much more positive, and probably a lot shorter. But, since he didn't, let us continue.Now, there are multiple categories of anger-invoking pidgeonholing, enough that I feel that pidgeonholing the categories themselves would best convey the point of it all.First off, Race:
Randy figures it all has to do with your state at mind at the time you utter the word. If you’re just trying to abbreviate, it’s not a slur. But if you are fomenting racist hatreds, as Sean Daniel McGee occasionally seems to be not above doing, that’s different.
No. No. No no no no no. Did I stutter? No. It doesn't matter what the utterer's mindset is, period. What matters is the context of the utterance, the horrible history of its usage and the culture that it denigrates. So sorry that the word 'Japanese' is too long and difficult for some people to say/type/convey to another person for long periods of time, but they're going to have to deal with it. Their personal convenience doesn't matter in the slightest.Second, Religion:
In other circumstances, the religious reference would make Randy uncomfortable, but here it seems like the only appropriate thing to say. Think what you will about religious people, they always have something to say at times like this. What would an atheist come up with? Yes, the organisms inhabiting that submarine must have lost their higher neural functions over a prolonged period of time and eventually turned into pieces of rotten meat. So what?
I don't know if this is supposed to be satire, and I don't care. The message is bad enough, as once again, lack of spiritual beliefs is being confused with lack of morality/sympathy/empathy/what have you. Some may not believe this, but the human race is perfectly capable of acting decent and, dare I say it, humane towards its fellow beings, without religion. Amazing, isn't it. Moving on.Next, Women:I wish I was joking when I say that there is too much material for me to possibly convey in this review without pushing the limits of absurdity. So I will condense it into some bullet points.One: There is a popular maxim in this book that holds women to be an effective means to an end of ultimate manly productiveness. Not only that, but women for some reason are completely aware of this, and manipulate men accordingly via controlling the rates of fornication permitted to those with a Y chromosome. Yes, because that's all there is to sex, isn't it. Love is just some barter system of producers and consumers, and any notion of emotional connection or meaning beyond it is a lie propagated by the chemicals seething in your body. Now, the latter half of that last sentence is biologically sound. I would hope that everything that came before it is some kind of ridiculous satire, but if it is, Mr. Stephenson's writing did not seem to think so.Two: The definition of the words SEXUAL ABUSE and RAPE was expanded to include pursuit of relationships where 'power imbalance' is denoted by differences in economic status and/or physical capabilities in defending oneself. Again, I wish this was satire, but its delivery made it highly unlikely. And even if it was satire, it's not in the least bit funny or ethical to make light of rape culture in such a fashion. If the recent events of Steubenville and its aftermath haven't made that clear, nothing will.Three: And we couldn't possibly finish off this whole debacle without a good old fashioned Men are from Mars Women are from Venus spiel. In the author's own words, those who put a higher priority ""on having every statement uttered in a conversation be literally true"" vs ""People who put a higher priority on social graces"". Then you get the typical longwinded 'it's not you it's me' excuse, and finally:
""What I'm saying is that this does set me apart. One of the most frightening things about your true nerd, for many people, is not that he's socially inept—because everyone's been there—but rather his complete lack of embarrassment.""""Which is still kind of pathetic.""""It was pathetic when they were in high school,"" Randy says. ""Now it's something else. Something very different from pathetic.""""What, then?""""I don't know. There is no word for it. You'll see.""
Hint: The word you're looking for lies on the long scale that ranges from ""close-minded"" to ""bigoted asshole"". Take your pick.Finally, your Miscellaneous:
…the post-modern, politically correct atheists were like people who had suddenly found themselves in charge of a big and unfathomably complex computer system (viz. society) with no documentation or instructions of any kind, and so whose only way to keep the thing running was to invent and enforce certain rules with a kind of neo-Puritanical rigor, because they were at a loss to deal with deviations from what they saw as the norm. Whereas people who were wired into a church were like UNIX system administrators who, while they might not understand everything, at least had some documentation, some FAQs and How-tos and README files, providing some guidance on what to do when things got out of whack. They were, in other words, capable of displaying adaptability.
Atheists are not in charge of anything, and in fact are one of the most hated demographics in the US. Look it up. Also, don't you think those who have to build up from scratch would be a little more adaptable than, say, the user manual types who are still squabbling over a particular patch of verses regarding a certain sexuality? A demographic that Mr. Stephenson made repeated efforts to proclaim that he was okay with, coincidentally. The thing about being a 'nice guy', no one's going to give you a cookie for pointing it out. That's not how it works.In addition, if the phrase 'politically correct' was replaced with 'respects those who are different despite lack of understanding of their cultural heritage', and seen as less of a political theory pertaining to the liberals and more of a methodology of encouraging greater social well-being, the world would be a better place. And there would be less theories like the one in this book running about, which states that the only way to avoid Holocausts is to make sure the victims get proper guerrilla training. Very reminiscent of the current debacle over gun control. But anyways. tl&dr version: Mr. Stephenson is your typical white male nerd that resides in the US. Smart in his specific field, little bit racist, little bit misogynistic, and screws up any attempt to try and claim otherwise. The prevalence of this attitude would've chopped the stars down to one, but he did write a 900+ book filled with some pretty interesting mathematical acrobatics and WWII business, so that added a star to the final result.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816.Cryptonomicon
Children of the Mind;Orson Scott Card;1996;1990;370;3.78;109618;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Space'];Children of the Mind (1996) is the fourth novel of Orson Scott Card's popular Ender's Game series of science fiction novels that focus on the character Ender Wiggin. This book was originally the second half of Xenocide, before it was split into two novels.At the start of Children of the Mind, Jane, the evolved computer intelligence, is using her newly discovered abilities to take the races of buggers, humans and pequeninos outside the universe and back instantaneously. She uses these powers to move them to distant habitable planets for colonization. She is losing her memory and concentration as the vast computer network connected to the ansible is being shut down. If she is to survive, she must find a way to transfer her aiúa (or soul) to a human body.;"I know several readers, myself included, who were blown away by Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. They then found the sequel, Speaker for the Dead, to be equally as riveting and eagerly reached for Xenocide, book three in the series, with the highest of expectations--only to be slammed with disappointment. This otherwise serviceable book, with an original premise and interesting characters, crashes to an unsatisfying and confusing ending that combines the worst attributes of deus ex machina and sequel hooking. Back in the mid-90s, it seemed that only the most devoted of Ender fans dared to approach the fourth book, Children of the Mind. The rest of us avoided it like the descolada virus itself. This situation may have changed over the ensuing decade as Card has published a number of prequel and sequel books in the Ender universe including a notable series about the life and times of Ender Wiggin's schoolmate, Bean. As the story world has expanded, characters have been fleshed out, political systems have been better defined, and the original quadrology has been reframed into a new context. Xenocide-burned readers may finally be ready to take tentative steps toward CotM--or at least that's my theory, after receiving an endorsement of the book from a friend who described it as ""not as bad as everyone thought it would have to be."" So I read the book and it was, indeed, not as bad as everyone thought it would have to be--but it's no Ender's Game, either. It helps to know that Xenocide and CotM were originally conceived as a single volume, which was divided in half when the page count climbed higher than the publisher was willing to accommodate. CotM's confusing and disjointed opening takes place only moments after Xenocide's confusing and disjointed ending, and neither book feels complete on its own. I'm sure the author did the best he could but the result still reads like a botched operation to separate conjoined twins. CoTM starts in the middle of the action with no easy recap for those of us who haven't read the previous book in a while, so a better transition would have been appreciated. Perhaps something like I've done in this episode of Book Review Theater...EXTERIOR - EXTRASOLAR PLANET WITH THREE MOONS IN AN ORANGE SKY, WHERE PEOPLE STROLL ALONG A BOARDWALK THAT SEPARATES A BEACH ON ONE SIDE FROM URBAN BLIGHT ON THE OTHER - LATE EVENINGA cardboard box appears from nowhere. Peter Wiggin and Si Wang-mu emerge, look around in confusion for a moment, and confront the first man passing by.PETER: Excuse me, sir? MAN: Yeah? Whatta you want?PETER: I'm an extra-universally created simulation of Peter Wiggin, the late Hegemon of the Free People of Earth, under the spiritual control of Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin who is and will remain, until his imminent death of old age, reviled and celebrated, respectively, as Xenocide and Speaker for the Dead.WANG-MU: And I am Wang-mu, a former slave with artificially-enhanced intellectual capacity, ironically named after a Chinese goddess. Also ironically, the so-called free people of my society were in fact enslaved to outside powers by virtue of their genetically-crafted OCD tendencies while peasants and slaves like myself remained actually free.PETER: With the aid of Jane, a unique artificial intelligence originally created by an alien race that's falsely presumed to be extinct at the hands of my apparent younger brother and puppetmaster, we are travelling from Wang-Mu's home world--WANG-MU: The Planet Where Everyone Is Chinese.PETER: Right. From Wang-Mu's home world, The Planet Where Everyone is Chinese, we were meant to find The Planet Where Everyone Is A Pacific Islander by way of The Planet Where Everyone is Japanese.WANG-MU (looks around): With my advanced intellect, I've determined that this is not any of those worlds.MAN: Nah. This is The Planet Where Everyone Is From New Jersey. Got a problem with that?PETER: Not at all, my hairy knuckle-dragging friend. It would seem that Jane is playing a practical joke on us, or perhaps manipulating our journey in the same way that everyone around us seems to be constantly manipulating everyone else in some way or other.WANG-MU: Including ourselves.PETER: I'm sorry for taking up your time, but we really must be going. A fleet is approaching The Planet Where Everyone is Brazilian with the intention of blowing the whole thing up, not knowing yet that a cure to the dreaded species-scrambling descolada virus has been found, or that their actions would mean genocide for the last remaining Buggers as well as the native Piggies and Jane herself--who is unique enough to be considered her own species. Did I mention that Jane has the ability to pop people in and out of the universe, allowing them to create impossible objects, bring people back from the dead, and cure brain damage or deformities of the body?WANG-MU: Which is why we must prevent Congress from shutting Jane down by persuading some influential philosophers that the events of World War II back on Earth are still relevant in space so many thousands of years later.Peter and Wang-mu step back into the cardboard box, which promptly vanishes.MAN: What a couple of self-important jerks!Something like that would have helped a lot, although the premise does seem rather silly and far-fetched when you try to boil it down to a few short paragraphs of exposition. It also reveals a major weakness of the story world: the assumption that Earth would colonize new worlds on a nation-by-nation basis and that the resulting planetary cultures would not change or evolve noticeably from their progenitors. This detail seems glaringly unrealistic in light of Card's obsession with such anthropological details as food, architecture, and language.Ender himself hardly appears in this book, and perhaps the most memorable character from Xenocide, OCD-laden genius Han Qing-jao, is missing entirely--only represented in CotM by tantalizing excerpts from her philosophical writings, which serve as thematic chapter headers. But Qing-jao's presence would perhaps have been redundant since she is far from the series's only deep-thinking philosopher and author of impactful works that have changed the lives of billions or trillions of people. In addition to Quing-jao, this would include Ender (author of a trilogy that has stayed continuously in print for over three thousand years), Valentine and Peter (who manipulated world governments through their pseudonymous writings as Demosthenes and Locke), Aimaina Hikari (whose works inspired attempted xenocide), Grace (whose writings inspired Hikari), Malu (whose works inspired Grace), and Plikt (who, as the speaker for Ender's death, has a lock on a future bestseller as well).Only Ender's stepdaughter, Quara, seems to lack the bug for philosophizing and authorship, so of course the other characters use her as a punching bag for their verbal abuse--which highlights another annoyance I experienced with this book. Every scene is either a dramafest of angst and confrontation or an excuse for long philosophical soliloquies that usually include at least one Shakespeare quotation. Or often, both. Almost without exception, every philosophical theory presented in the book is then subsequently picked apart and discarded as childish and simplistic compared to the unexpressed deeper thoughts that all of our genius characters are keeping to themselves. This makes for one long, emotionally draining, and often pompous book.Bottom Line: Every reader of thought-provoking science fiction, age 10 through 110, should pick up copies of Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. My prior warning to avoid Xenocide is tempered somewhat, but anyone who continues onward in the series should read Xenocide and Children of the Mind together and be prepared for an exhausting and confusing ride.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31360.Children_of_the_Mind
The Memory Police;Yōko Ogawa;1994;1990;274;3.72;98379;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Japan', 'Fantasy', 'Japanese Literature', 'Magical Realism'];On an unnamed island off an unnamed coast, objects are disappearing: first hats, then ribbons, birds, roses—until things become much more serious. Most of the island's inhabitants are oblivious to these changes, while those few imbued with the power to recall the lost objects live in fear of the draconian Memory Police, who are committed to ensuring that what has disappeared remains forgotten.When a young woman who is struggling to maintain her career as a novelist discovers that her editor is in danger from the Memory Police, she concocts a plan to hide him beneath her floorboards. As fear and loss close in around them, they cling to her writing as the last way of preserving the past.A surreal, provocative fable about the power of memory and the trauma of loss, The Memory Police is a stunning new work from one of the most exciting contemporary authors writing in any language.;"The horrors of forgetting
At first glance, The Memory Police, originally published in Japan in 1994 and now available in an excellent English translation, looks like a descendant of George Orwell's. Set on an unnamed island, objects are routinely ""disappeared"", both physically and also in the minds of the people. One day birds disappear. The next day it could be a type of candy. Anyone who dares to keep disappeared items is in danger. Those who actually remember them are in bigger danger. The Memory Police, clad in luxurious uniforms, keep everyone living in fear. People who remember are taken away, never to return again.When a young writer learns her editor is one of the people who remembers, she is determined to protect him by hiding him in a secret room in her house.So, yeah, it's set up like a typical dystopian novel that deftly illustrates the insidious, dehumanizing claw of totalitarianism. And Yōko Ogawa does this very well. There's a quiet tension that stalks the pages of the novel. The fear, claustrophobia and struggle feel real. But she moves further (and I love that she did this), past the political, and into the larger, universal sphere of death.Yes, death. Because the people don't just lose objects when things are disappeared. With each lost item, people also lose the associated memories. Thus, their hearts, souls, and selves suffer losses that cannot be recovered. The young woman worries about the day when everything on the island is disappeared. When the people are disappeared. Her editor, a man who still can remember, keeps reassuring her. Just because things have been disappeared doesn't make them any less real. Even if everything disappeared, the stories would be there. He promises to protect the memories.But with patient, hypnotic progression, the losses continue. It becomes less about the woman losing the world around her and more about the man losing the woman before his eyes.I loved this, my first foray into Ogawa's large oeuvre. Written in deceptively flat, simple prose, it offers no easy answers. We don't know the wheres, whens, hows, whys. This has twinges of The Vegetarian and even The Metamorphosis, with weird, alienating transformations and much left to the reader to discern. It also feels particularly relevant in today's world (and here's where it gets political again) where our collective memories seem no better than that of a goldfish's swimming in the ether, where yesterday's news is swallowed up in today's hypocrisy.Devastating and terrifying, this forced march towards complete loss. In a world where writers lose their voice, where is the hope? I like to believe it's tiny, and it's secret, and maybe it's not enough, but it's there, in a hidden room where the seeds of resistance and memory reside.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37004370-the-memory-police

New challenges to galactic peace have arisen. And Luke Skywalker hears a voice from his past. A voice with a warning. Beware the dark side….The Rebel Alliance has destroyed the Death Star, defeated Darth Vader and the Emperor, and driven the remnants of the old Imperial Starfleet back into barely a quarter of the territory that they once controlled. Leia and Han are married, are expecting Jedi twins, and have shouldered heavy burdens in the government of the new Republic. And Luke Skywalker is the first in a hoped-for new line of Jedi Knights.But thousands of light years away, where a few skirmishes are still taking place, the last of the Emperor's warlords has taken command of the remains of the Imperial fleet. He has made two vital discoveries that could destroy the fragile new Republic—built with such cost to the Rebel Alliance. The tale that emerges is a towering epic of action, invention, mystery, and spectacle on a galactic scale—in short, a story that is worthy of the name Star Wars.;One of the coolest, most badass, best written antagonists, not just in a universe far, far away, but also in the known realm of sci-fi literature. Free creativity in a franchise universeThat´s not just pure joy for every Star Wars addict, it´s even something for the enemy fandom war fraction of Trekkies, because that´s not the usual, loveless adaption authors are writing with the restriction, and thereby less motivation, of having to copy the famous movie, game, or already established series. That´s an author loving his antagonist and developing Thrawn, better, deeper, and more fascinating than many protagonists could just wish for.  Integrating an awesome antagonistZahn is a stereotypical sci-fi writer, studied physics, started writing and, and that´s very important, focused on Star Wars by establishing his own character brand, Thrawn, he could put all his energy into, to let him take his place in the already existing universe. By that, it´s not a loveless shell, no reproduction of protagonists produced by someone else, but a new and original character that is credible, different, and just so Chuck Norris mixed with supervillain I can´t imagine a similar combination of awesome and awful traits.  Unleash the evil potentialIf publishers would allow more writers to create such expansions of known series, the whole universe would benefit from it, because by better understanding the often underrepresented villains and enemy fractions, everyone wins.

It is to some extent a science fiction coming-of-age story, focused on a young girl named Nell, and set in a future world in which nanotechnology affects all aspects of life. The novel deals with themes of education, social class, ethnicity, and the nature of artificial intelligence.;I get the feeling that Stephenson's writing process goes something like this:Hey, I found a really cool idea here. I wonder what I can do about it....He then writes about 200 pages of really awesome, meticulous world-building, with innovative ideas about, in the case of this book, the possibly uses of nanotechnology and its eventual social ramifications, and then goes, Oh, damn, I'm writing a story, and high-tails it to the end of the book, leaving the reader a little wind-blown and confused. It happened in Snow Crash, where he was playing with the origins of language and the fundamental functioning of the human mind. It happened in Cryptonomicon, where he dove into the murky waters of cryptography and brought up brilliant gems, and it happened here, too.The Diamond Age is, fundamentally, about what would happen, or what might happen, if we really got nanotechnology working properly. How would society adapt if, suddenly, government became obsolete? With the Feed and the Matter Compilers able to create anything out of nothing, the entire economic and political underpinnings of the planet came undone, and people banded together into phyles. Like-minded individuals bonded with each other through shared values and morality, united only by a commonly upheld treaty which, in turn, rested on the new economy that nanotechnology allowed.Within one of the phyles, the Neo-Victorians, one of the more highly-placed Lords realized what was wrong with the world. The problem wasn't the corruption of values of which the old always accuse the young - indeed it was that those values were passed on too well. Children did not elect to join their phyles, they were indoctrinated into them from birth, which made them, well, boring.And so Lord Finkle-McGraw commissioned a great work - The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer to guide his granddaughter to a more interesting life. And had that been all that happened, the story would have been short. But two other copes of the Primer were made - one for the daughter of the book's designer, and another that fell into the hands of Nell, a young girl born into poverty and otherwise destined to lead a life of misery and sorrow.The Primer is a smart book, fully interactive, able to teach reading, science, history and martial arts, among other things. And what it teaches little Nell is how to be great.All of this is quite awesome - there's a great hunt for the Primer, plans within plans and all that. And then, suddenly, a new plot about a technology to supplant the Feed and some kind of Chinese revolution and the whole book runs off the rails.I know a lot of people love Neal Stephenson, and I can understand why. He's an incomparably imaginative man, who is able to find ways to express ideas that some of us couldn't even imagine. He's an heir to the world of that William Gibson and his contemporaries pioneered. He creates captivating worlds and characters and problems without simple solutions.He just keeps bollixing up the endings. Seriously, it's like a whole different story kicks in around page 250. I'm willing to read more of his works, though, in the hope that he's getting his act together....;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827.The_Diamond_Age
I Who Have Never Known Men;Jacqueline Harpman;1995;1990;208;4.22;84920;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Feminism', 'Literary Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy'];"""As far back as I can recall, I have been in the bunker.""A young woman is kept in a cage underground with thirty-nine other females, guarded by armed men who never speak; her crimes unremembered... if indeed there were crimes.The youngest of forty—a child with no name and no past—she survives for some purpose long forgotten in a world ravaged and wasted. In this reality where intimacy is forbidden—in the unrelenting sameness of the artificial days and nights—she knows nothing of books and time, of needs and feelings.Then everything changes... and nothing changes.A young woman who has never known men—a child who knows of no history before the bars and restraints—must now reinvent herself, piece by piece, in a place she has never been... and in the face of the most challenging and terrifying of unknowns: freedom.";"“I was forced to acknowledge too late, much too late, that I too had loved, that I was capable of suffering, and that I was human after all.”
4 1/2 stars. Wow. This tiny, disquieting book carries a sadness that the most popular tearjerkers could never hope to capture. It sits outside of genre, outside of time, outside of the reality we know, introducing the reader to a world unfamiliar to both them and the unnamed protagonist. The result is a palpable feeling of wonder and loneliness.I have decided to round up because this book made me feel so deeply, and because I have decided that my personal frustrations are perhaps misguided. There were things that I was hoping for from this book that I didn't get, but then I was never promised them, and, in fact, the past tense narration forewarned I would not get them. So that's my problem.The story starts in an underground bunker where thirty-nine women and one young girl-- our narrator --are imprisoned in a cage. They don't remember how they got there and they have no idea why they are there. The women remember a life before the cage with families, friends and jobs, but the child remembers only their current existence. They are watched over and fed by male guards who tell them nothing. It seems they are doomed to live and die in this cage... until one day a combination of chance and ingenuity provide an opportunity for freedom.It is part eerie pastoral dystopia, part a deeply introspective novel about hope, loneliness and the things that give life meaning. The novel swings between the invigorating feeling of hope and the numbing despair of hopelessness.I found myself wondering at one point if it was supposed to be a metaphor. The relentless pursuit of answers, of meaning, in a world that ultimately makes no sense. But perhaps I am overthinking things. Either way, this short novel sat like a ball of anxiety in my throat from beginning to end. What a sad, evocative little story.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11996.I_Who_Have_Never_Known_Men
Red Mars;Kim Stanley Robinson;1992;1990;572;3.86;83754;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction'];In his most ambitious project to date, award-winning author Kim Stanley Robinson utilizes years of research and cutting-edge science in the first of a trilogy chronicling the colonization of Mars. For eons, sandstorms have swept the desolate landscape. For centuries, Mars has beckoned humans to conquer its hostile climate. Now, in 2026, a group of 100 colonists is about to fulfill that destiny. John Boone, Maya Toitavna, Frank Chalmers and Arkady Bogdanov lead a terraforming mission. For some, Mars will become a passion driving them to daring acts of courage and madness. For others it offers an opportunity to strip the planet of its riches. For the genetic alchemists, it presents a chance to create a biomedical miracle, a breakthrough that could change all we know about life and death. The colonists orbit giant satellite mirrors to reflect light to the surface. Black dust sprinkled on the polar caps will capture warmth. Massive tunnels, kilometers deep, will be drilled into the mantle to create stupendous vents of hot gases. Against this backdrop of epic upheaval, rivalries, loves and friendships will form and fall to pieces—for there are those who will fight to the death to prevent Mars from ever being changed. Brilliantly imagined, breathtaking in scope and ingenuity, Red Mars is an epic scientific saga, chronicling the next step in evolution, creating a world in its entirety. It shows a future, with both glory and tarnish, that awes with complexity and inspires with vision.;"I just finished reading this for the second or third time. I wish I could bump this up to 3.5 stars, which more reflects what I feel about it. To begin with, I should come forward with my biases. This is a book you'll either love or you will hate. For my part, I love the planet Mars. Or at least, I love the idea of the planet Mars, because I've never been there. I'd love to go though. If someone from NASA told me that I could go to Mars, and there was only a 50/50 chance I'd survive, I'd be like, ""That good, huh? I'm sold. Let's do it. When do we leave?"" My wife might talk me out of it (she hates the cold), but if I didn't have obligations to family, I'd be there in a heartbeat. I've got this big wall poster of Mars, laid out in all its plucky glory - the Tharsis bulge, the big volcanoes, the massive flood erosion systems. I want to walk on its surface under the red sky and feel the thin cold wind, and this is a book for Mars geeks by a Mars geek. Like Nadia, I want to wildly dance for joy on the Martian dust. If you don't love or can't love the idea of Mars, then all the talk of its ferrous oxides, sulfur drifts, salt pans, and garnet sands is going to bore you to tears. If you do however love Mars, reading this is something like biting into a big decadent layered fair trade organic chocolate bar with 71% dark rich Costa Rican cocoa. So that's my bias, and I think it's a good one, but if you can't entertain thoughts like that be prepared to be bored by like half this novel.So what is this novel about? Well, obviously, it's about Mars, but more than that it is about humans on Mars and how people establish an identity and a cultural identity in particular. It is a story about the tension between existing cultural identities and ways of looking at the world and adapting and adopting new identities. It's a story about conflicting mutually exclusive goals, and how we go about resolving - or more often than not - failing to resolve our differences. In that I think the book succeeds marvelously, because the resulting Martian culture with all its disparate influences seems in many ways believable to me and even in some ways compelling so that I'm sucked into it and want to proclaim my allegiance to the Red or Green tradition, and twitter stories about Big Man and where I was when Boone died around the nuclear-powered blog fire.The best part of the story by far is that KSR doesn't attempt to tell a story as big as the colonization of Mars from the perspective a single person. Instead, the story sprawls across a huge cast of characters and expanse of time. Our viewpoint shifts from one major character to another, and people we thought we understood suddenly seem strange and different when seen from within or through someone else's eyes. Like many sci-fi authors, KSR can have his didactic moments, but unlike many his are softened by the fact that none of his characters are in and of themselves really the voice of the author. All of the characters even the most heroic turn out to have flaws of one sort or another, and so rather than being forced to read the dialogue as 'KSR believes this and is willing to hit you over the head with it', you can read the politics as 'John or Arkady (or Saxifrage or whoever) believes this, just as many real people do'. The politics of Mars as KSR envisions them turn out to be messy, very human, often petty, and with few simple answers and little in the way of clear answers and simple solutions. That's refreshing, even when KSR's biases are showing.So why not more stars? Well, the book has big Martian sized problems to go along with its delights. For me, the chief of these is how easy the conquest of Mars is made to seem. It reads like the conquest of Mars as written by someone that has never even been camping, much less someone acquainted with the hardships of an outdoor life. Given the enormous challenges of living on a planet with a thin poisonous atmosphere, a surprisingly small portion of the book is devoted to the theme of 'Man vs. Nature' and most of the time when it is, the cause of the conflict is man's own efforts - as if Mars in its natural state isn't absolutely deadly to human life. I personally have a hard time imagining that something on the scale of the colonization of Mars would be safer, less arduous, and less fraught with danger and hardship than say the colonization of the New World. KSR just doesn't seem particularly interested in that part of the story, which to my mind is perhaps the most critical part of the story. Instead, all the meticulous scientific research is undermined by hand waving all the hard problems away with a wave of the techno-magic wand. The colonization of Mars begins not on a comparative shoe string, but with an abundance of material massing at least one-hundred thousand times the mass of everything we've ever lifted into orbit. Energy sources are never scarce, and manufacturing capacity quickly soars to an unlimited degree. Technological challenges are quickly overcome by the liberal application of newfoundium and sometimes unobtainium. Almost everyone who dies dies through direct or indirect human agency. Accidents, especially serious ones, just don't seem to happen - Arkady's all to believable problem runs are confined to simulators. Thus, all the quite evident bloody striving of the author to create a believable story of planetary colonization is largely wasted and at times the story resembles just another escapist far future space opera.But most of the rest of the novel's problems are also its strengths. Its sprawling scale is suited to the story, but makes it easy to get lost. It's changing points of view and flawed heroes means on the other hand that the book lacks a consistently sympathetic protagonist to get behind and root for. It doesn't help the matter that many of the most likable characters end up dead.It's not a book for everyone, but since humanity seems unlikely to grow up and start thinking about leaving the nest in my lifetime, this is probably as close to Mars as you or I will come. And, though it is a flawed story, it's still an extremely powerful and often moving one that I have little doubt will be read with interest and appreciation by anyone that actually does take up the struggle to live on and with Earth's redder sibling.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77507.Red_Mars
Battle Royale;Koushun Takami;1999;1990;624;4.26;78074;no;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Young Adult', 'Japan'];Koushun Takami's notorious high-octane thriller is based on an irresistible premise: a class of junior high school students is taken to a deserted island where, as part of a ruthless authoritarian program, they are provided arms and forced to kill one another until only one survivor is left standing. Criticized as violent exploitation when first published in Japan - where it then proceeded to become a runaway bestseller - Battle Royale is a Lord of the Flies for the 21st century, a potent allegory of what it means to be young and (barely) alive in a dog-eat-dog world. Made into a controversial hit movie of the same name, Battle Royale is already a contemporary Japanese pulp classic, now available for the first time in the English language.;"I came across this book after reading “Hunger Games” by Suzanne Collins which was claimed to be a “Battle Royale” rip-off. Needless to say, I was curious…I have to admit, similarities between these two books are undeniable. They both are based on the same idea of teenagers forced to participate in a deadly game where only one person wins and lives. However at the same time these books are completely different. I believe you can enjoy and appreciate them both equally. If “Hunger Games” is more of a personal story of survival from the POV of just one ""player,"" “Battle Royale” is a complex story which follows all participants of the game. It is much more brutal, violent, and bloody than “Hunger Games.” The book explores what makes regular kids turn on each other, what in their pasts allows them to commit the ultimate crime or what stops them from participating in the killing game altogether. I have to warn however about a couple of things. First, the book has a lot of Japanese names that sound (and look) very similar. So in the beginning it can be hard to follow all characters, but you get used to them eventually. Another concern of mine is the quality of translation. It could have definitely been better. At times I felt something was lost in translation. But I immensely enjoyed this book in spite of the flaws. I would highly recommend this book to anybody who is not against gory and bloody reads.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57891.Battle_Royale
The Sparrow;Mary Doria Russell;1996;1990;419;4.14;77163;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Aliens', 'Adult'];"In 2019, humanity finally finds proof of extraterrestrial life when a listening post in Puerto Rico picks up exquisite singing from a planet that will come to be known as Rakhat. While United Nations diplomats endlessly debate a possible first contact mission, the Society of Jesus quietly organizes an eight-person scientific expedition of its own. What the Jesuits find is a world so beyond comprehension that it will lead them to question what it means to be ""human"".";I had picked this up years ago due to all the terrific reviews, but when I started it, since it involves priests and such, I thought it was going to be a Christian book. So I'm really glad that a group decided to read this, because it is NOT a yah-yah Christian book at all. I would instead call it a spiritual book in that the journey involves time old questions, of faith, of God, of religion, of humanity. And altho most of the main characters are indeed Jesuits and so many questions and approaches do involve Catholicism, they were universal. And very very beautiful. After I was done, I read that the author had left the Catholic church at age 15, and after 20 years of aetheism found herself re-examining questions of values, ethics, morality and religion upon the birth of her child. She found her drawn to Judaism and converted.And that makes alot of sense, in that The Sparrow does speak about religion but in a completely open, tolerant way. You can also be an aetheist and derive much insight into the nature of what drives us toward spirituality to begin with. And that morality and goodness has its place even outside any type of established religion.This was also one of the best first contact books - because The Sparrow is far more than just a question of what God is or isn't, but more so a fascinating study of anthropology. Of both humans and aliens. As a matter of fact, I'm sorry I started this review even discussing the religious aspect, because I would say the anthropology approach and insight is just as strong if not even a stronger force in the book.Which also makes a ton of sense since the author was an anthropolist!And I can not ignore the fact that the characters were some of the most complex, likable and developed you can find in any book.I liked this book so much I immediately started reading its sequel, Children of God, upon completion. The Sparrow itself is very much a stand-alone book, but I was so engrossed with Emilio I HAD to know what happened to him.Hmm. I might make this book a 5.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/334176.The_Sparrow
Dark Force Rising;Timothy Zahn;1992;1990;439;4.18;67907;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];The dying Empire's most cunning and ruthless warlord—Grand Admiral Thrawn—has taken command of the remnants of the Imperial fleet and launched a massive campaign aimed at the New Republic's destruction. Meanwhile, Han and Lando Calrissian race against time to find proof of treason inside the highest Republic Council—only to discover instead a ghostly fleet of warships that could bring doom to their friends and victory to their enemies.Yet most dangerous of all is a new Dark Jedi, risen from the ashes of a shrouded past, consumed by bitterness… and scheming to corrupt Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side.;Switching into unknown and different antagonist perspectives has never been that much fun.It shows that the true power lies in the background, that the light dark contrast of good and evil is the all controlling entity, that the stereotypical action heroes are just puppets of the true masters in the background, kind of politicians and media in the real world, and that the good ones can never reach the coolness and badassery of evil. Thrawn just owns close to any Star Wars antagonist, because the has the calm, sociopathic mind of a master strategist and the reader is extremely motivated to continue to see what will happen next, how his plans might fail, if he has a hidden joker in the backhand, how he immediately reacts in even the most difficult situations, and in general any scene including him. Heck, one waits across the protagonists´ chapters to meet the bad one again, that´s truly a well developed character. How flaw many of the Star wars protagonists have been written is especially obvious when contrasting it with Thrawn, although fangirls and boys will of course also enjoy the known stars of the show. Subjectively, maybe because I am in general closer to the dark side, I prefer well developed, understandable, motivated villains to generic and somewhat unrealistic and irresponsible heroes, but each one is free to choose her/his side and live with the consequences. I am quite looking forward to all the, hopefully coming, fandom inspired works, because there will certainly come pearls and masterpieces that are not just better than the movie, or even series in general, but also own the standard grew with introducing or expanding already existing, amazing antiheroes.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216442.Dark_Force_Rising
Parable of the Talents;Octavia E. Butler;1998;1990;448;4.31;63771;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic'];This Nebula Award-winning sequel to Parable of the Sower continues the story of Lauren Olamina in socially and economically depressed California in the 2030s. Convinced that her community should colonize the stars, Lauren and her followers make preparations. But the collapse of society and rise of fanatics result in Lauren's followers being enslaved, and her daughter stolen from her. Now, Lauren must fight back to save the new world order.;"Much More Than Sci-FiNeither Amazon nor the Library of Congress has a classification in which The Parable of the Talents fits easily. So it typically gets dumped into science fiction by default. But while the book does take place in the future, and extrapolates some of the possible consequences of things like climate change and computer-controlled weaponry, there is nothing unrecognisable as probably existing on somebody's drawing board, somewhere. There is certainly no typical sci-fi bending of the rules of Newtonian physics, or speculation about time travel, or revolutionary technology. The Parable of the Talents is in fact, as the title suggests, a work of theology, specifically political theology, the study of the link between community and individual belief. And although it overtly criticises evangelical Christianity, particularly the militant American brand, its target is really the monotheistic religions of the world - notably Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - not because they are monotheistic but because they are dogmatic, and consequently sectarian, and therefore useful for political manipulation, especially in modern democracies. The tale that Butler spins (in 1998) is eerily prescient of not just Donald Trump and his collusion with the American evangelical Right, but of Vladimir Putin's manipulation of Russian Orthodoxy and any number of Muslim politicians' tactics from Turkey to Indonesia. Monotheism, at least in its dogmatic forms, is clearly susceptible to political co-optation from Moses to Constantine to Khomeini. It may not be obvious to those outside the theological community that the great monotheistic religions are heresies of each other. All other religions are merely pagan. The Christian Trinity is a polytheistic heresy to Judaism and Islam. Muslim views of Jesus are variants of the Arian heresy of the 3rd century. Jewish rejection of Jesus as more than a not untypical rabbinic preacher is also a heretical rejection of the Christian doctrine of supersessionism which claims that the Christian Church is the true Israel. The theological complexity of all dogmatic religion is such that each of these distinguishing heresies, as it were, promote further differences and ultimately conflicts and schisms within each major religion ad infinitum. Butler is acutely aware of the role of monotheistic religion in the creation of her American dystopia, and in its reconstruction. Her main character is descended from a fundamentalist Baptist minister; her brother is a congenital religious fanatic. It is the diversity of dogmatic views that has caused, in the first instance, the disintegration of the American polity, and is, in the second, the rationale for the election of a dictator and the violent persecution of all who do not the doctrinal position of this Trump-like figure and his sympathisers.The spine of the novel, introducing each chapter and referred to continuously throughout, is the 'new faith' of Earthseed, which is the invention or, if you prefer, the revelation, of the protagonist as an antidote to dogmatic monotheism and its consequences. There are historical allusions to Ann Lee, the Shaker leader who brought that proto-feminist faith of Northern England to America, and to Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist, whose life-long concern was the primal religion that appears perennially throughout the world in various symbolic manifestations. But the main influence on Butler is clearly the so-called Process Theology that was developed originally by Alfred Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne in the 1920's and 1930's. The central insight of Process Theology, one can hardly call it a dogma, is that it is an essential attribute of God to affect and be affected by temporal processes. Although not consistent with some developed theology, this insight is not at odds with the fundamental scriptures of any of the monotheistic religions, which all present an acting, feeling, mutable God who apparently learns about human beings as they learn about Him. Process Theology does not deny various monotheistic tenets such as divine eternity, omnipotence or even the immutability of the 'core' of God, as it were. It just doesn't care about these dogmatic issues.Butler presents her theology in the form of a poem which develops as her story unfolds, a poem that Whitehead and Hartshorne would not, I am sure, be ashamed to have written. A single verse is enough to give the substance of the piece: ""All that you touch You change. All that you Change Changes you. The only lasting truth is Change. God is Change."" Change for Butler is not a fetish such as that proposed by current-day management consultants and psychological improvement merchants. Change is simply that which is inevitable and necessary for life, divine as well as human. We shape change which shapes us. This includes of course the shape we mould God into, which certainly in turn affects the shape we assume.*The fashion for Process Theology comes and goes with hemlines, but it has become an abiding force in academic religious thinking and affects many of the mainstream schools of theological thought. The fact that it is a somewhat esoteric discipline means that its relevance for practical affairs isn't immediately apparent. Quite apart from its literary value, which is considerable, Butler's work is important because it makes explicit both a fundamental issue in American, indeed modern European and Middle Eastern, society, namely the religious foundation of national unity, and a way in which that issue can be dealt with in an intellectual but practical way. For this achievement alone her brilliance must not be under-appreciated.* This theology is also consistent with Buddhist thought.

Endymion;Dan Simmons;1996;1990;563;4.19;63347;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Time Travel'];The multiple-award-winning SF master returns to the universe that is his greatest success--the world of Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion--to tell a story of love and memory, triumph and terror in a novel even more magnificent than its predecessors.Two hundred and seventy-four years after the fall of the WorldWeb in Fall of Hyperion, Raoul Endymion is sent on a quest. Retrieving Aenea from the Sphinx before the Church troops reach her is only the beginning. With help from a blue-skinned android named A. Bettik, Raoul and Aenea travel the river Tethys, pursued by Father Captain Frederico DeSoya, an influential warrior-priest and his troops. The shrike continues to make enigmatic appearances, and while many questions were raised in Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion, still more are raised here. Raoul's quest will continue.;"Want a free cruciform? Won´t hurt that long. Bodily.

One should definitively consider taking notes and, or, marking highlights, and especially continuing the thoughts, offered by this amazing series, to expand and fuse them with the knowledge collected by reading other sci-fi to get the full, immersive pleasure.Some don´t like this novel that much and I don´t get why, it has everything, and criticizing Simmons for being too wordy would be the same as doing it with King, just very weird.

(Answer: Kind of like newsgroups from 1993.) But this is just the account we're reading, which, it seems, comes from races as diverse as super-intelligent plants and floating magellanic clouds. It has all been translated into something resembling English, admittedly rough approximations at times. Because why would I have anything in common with someone from a billion light years away? I don't have anything in common with my co-workers.I also really dig the way Vinge divides the universe into ""Zones of Thought,"" so technology gets more advanced (as do the beings that operate it) the further you get from the center (as you might guess, Earth is in the ""Slow Zones""). Mostly this provides an engine for the plot, but it's one of those ideas so mind-burstingly big that you can't really get a grip on it. If the transcendent, godlike beings on the periphery of this system are beholden to it, then... what intelligence originally created it? And how do they get their computer network to operate so efficiently, because I keep having to unplug my modem?Cool ideas. Cool, cool, cool. I didn't even mention the race of hive-minded puppy people that play a key role in the narrative (one puppy alone is dumb, but four or six in a bunch can act as a single consciousness!). Is good, because it makes up for the ever-so-slightly leaden narrative, which is a bit thin for a 600-pager. Basically, a team of human scientists awaken a malevolent A.I. somewhere in space; it goes berserk and begins chowing down on entire star systems (star systems, people!). A few scientists escape and crash land on Planet Puppies. Word spreads that the crashed ship holds the only secret to stopping the vaguely-described villain thingy, so some stock-but-loveable heroes quest off to get it. Half the book elaborately sketches out what a society of hive-minds would look like (ADORABLE!); the other is a tense (and then for a while, not so tense, and then tense again) chase sequence. It's pretty fun.This is a densely written but still perfectly understandable SF novel, but it does presume a certain familiarity and comfort with the genre, so I wouldn't start my reading here. I know I tried it about five years ago and didn't even make it through the prologue. The book was too big to fit inside me head. Now it's bigger.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77711.A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep
Doomsday Book;Connie Willis;1992;1990;578;4.03;61024;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];For Kivrin, preparing an on-site study of one of the deadliest eras in humanity's history was as simple as receiving inoculations against the diseases of the fourteenth century and inventing an alibi for a woman traveling alone. For her instructors in the twenty-first century, it meant painstaking calculations and careful monitoring of the rendezvous location where Kivrin would be received.But a crisis strangely linking past and future strands Kivrin in a bygone age as her fellows try desperately to rescue her. In a time of superstition and fear, Kivrin--barely of age herself--finds she has become an unlikely angel of hope during one of history's darkest hours.Connie Willis draws upon her understanding of the universalities of human nature to explore the ageless issues of evil, suffering, and the indomitable will of the human spirit.;"Somehow, by the year 2053, we'll have invented time travel but lost the use of cell phone technology. You'd think that was a pretty good trade-off, right? Well, if you've read a few of Connie Willis' ""future historian"" time travel books, you know that we're probably better off as we are, because without cell phones, it seems humanity would spend most of its days in fevered attempts to place calls by landline video phone, narrowly missing one another, encountering busy circuits, unable to locate anyone not at his home or office. This would go on for hundreds of pages.Or look at it this way: Connie Willis really needs an editor. Because this is 1/2 of a fantastic book grafted to 250 pages of tiresome running about with no real purpose. This is the same format Willis prefers for all of her longer works: lots of really great writing and compelling characters, but you have to wade through a bunch of repetitive ""funny bits"" to get to them, most of which seem to have to do with telephones. I also could have done without nearly a dozen scenes of characters almost dispensing vital information, then falling into unconsciousness.But after a few hundred pages, all the annoying stuff is over with and suddenly you're falling in love with all of the characters, and dreading what's going to happen to them, especially the ones in the Middle Ages, because the Black Death wasn't known for leaving a whole lot of survivors. And I'll say one thing for Willis, she isn't afraid to kill characters you like, and here she kills a lot of them. The end of the book is profoundly sad, and only a tiny bit uplifting; the ultimate message is that there is value in the struggle even if the outcome is failure. And yet it's not a depressing read, somehow. It's also not quite as gross and plague-y as you might fear, with only a small portion of the text devoted to lancing sores and vomiting blood. So that's always nice.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24983.Doomsday_Book
The Last Command;Timothy Zahn;1993;1990;467;4.26;60939;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];The embattled Republic reels from the attacks of Grand Admiral Thrawn, who has marshaled the remnants of the Imperial forces and driven the Rebels back with an abominable technology recovered from the Emperor's secret fortress: clone soldiers. As Thrawn mounts his final siege, Han and Chewbacca struggle to form a coalition of smugglers for a last-ditch attack against the empire, while Leia holds the Alliance together and prepares for the birth of her Jedi twins. Overwhelmed by the ships and clones at Thrawn's command, the Republic has one last hope--sending a small force, led by Luke Skywalker, into the very stronghold that houses Thrawn's terrible cloning machines. There a final danger awaits, as the Dark Jedi C'baoth directs the battle against the Rebels and builds his strength to finish what he had already started: the destruction of Luke Skywalker.Features a bonus section following the novel that includes a primer on the Star Wars expanded universe, and over half a dozen excerpts from some of the most popular Star Wars books of the last thirty years!;"A trilogy that evolved in a wise way.

But it was so artistically done.

HOW A TRILOGY SHOULD BE
Maybe how a trilogy should be it’s that all three parts would be the same as good. I am sure nobody would mind about that.However, if perfection isn’t in the equation, I think that a wise approach is constructing a solid first part, not necessarily extraordinary, but with great potential to become better and introducing interesting new characters. Then, having a second part involving a bigger scope action and since we would have an expected third part, so why not a victory for the bad guys? So far, it was a format quite similar to the original movie trilogy of Star Wars (while I do think that the first film was truly extraordinary, where yes, the scope in the second film was bigger and more intense, both movies the same as epic and iconic). Then the fearful third part comes.Moviegoers can tell you how hard is having good third movies in a trilogy (why? I don’t know, maybe some voodoo curse, or something!) but it’s almost inevitable after two good movies, having a failure in the third movie. Even sometimes, if we are so kind with those third movies, we can rescue some elements, we can appreciate some effort, but the unmerciful general opinión decrees that the third movie wasn’t near as good as the previous ones. You know? I like the third movie of Star Wars. Close friends know that my complain is about the use of the Ewoks. And it’s not the Ewoks per se, since I find them as an interesting alien species and even they had a whole better 80’s animated series in comparison with the boring and poor produced Droids. My objection falls in making a comedy-like battle of primitive almost-naked care bears against profesional trained armored-suited soldiers.In any case, we could have an eternal discussion if Return of the Jedi is as good as its two previous installments.The same kind of arguments, I’m sure, since I have no doubt there must be many readers who consider that all three books in the Thrawn Trilogy deserved a full 5-stars rating. Where I have no problems with that, since it’s the right of each reader to give the ratings that they feel that it reflects as their own personal reading experience with the books.In my own personal case, it was like an increasing reading experience. Heir to the Empire was a 3-stars’ experience (still on the good side of a positive reading), then Dark Force Rising was a 4-stars’ experience, and now, in this book, The Last Command, I am truly glad of finding it as a truly 5-stars’ experience, that seeing the trilogy as a whole long story, I found that it’s the ideal way to present a story, since indeed the climax, the final part should be the strongest and most solid section of the entire narrative.
A LEADER IS AS GOOD AS HIS/HER OFFICERS
Grand Admiral Thrawn was a formidable strategist and a born leader.However, a leader is as good as his/her officers. I still am kinda hesitant about his appreciation of how the Emperor may use the Force to coordinate fleets formations but it’s clear that Thrawn has a vision, a clear vision of how to deploy an effective plan to give back the Empire its former glory.Sadly, he can’t be everywhere, and he needed to trust in the decisions of his/her officers and associates where even they may have “good intentions” to help the cause (sometimes they may be just plain crazy), but the final result can be disastrous. And even Earth’s Roman Emperors’ history can give useful tips of how crutial is who you choose as your own personal security (of course, it’s possible that since Earth is in another galaxy, far far away from them, the Empire wasn’t aware of certain history’s valuable lessons) but still since Thrawn is shown as some formidable strategist and a military leader seeing two steps ahead of his fellow comrades and enemies, it’s kinda odd that he may be susceptible to such dangerous situations.
ATTACK OF THE CLOONEYS
The idea of having evil crazy clones is really cool. However, their choices of names is kinda odd.I mean, without making any spoiler (don’t worry), there are clones there, okay? But their names is basically the same name of their original counterparts but just adding an extra vowel (a,e,i,o or u) in their names, and while there are some vowels where when you have a distinct sound (Geez! I feel like doing a Sesame Street segment!) there are some vowels that even having two of them, the sound would be pretty much the same. Sure, in a prose novel like this one, you can easily differentiate them from your comfy position as reader......but how the heck the characters can tell any difference in the names?!!!It’s not like Jango Fett’s clones just decided to name themselves “Jaango” as an unanimous call. No, they chose to name themselves like Cody, Rex and so on. Even Jango’s unaltered clone is named Bobba. Totally different names.Even weirder, I think that there is some intention of deception in the crazy evil clones here, in the sense that they may want to be perceive as the “originals” and not clones, so why bother even to choose names that they are virtually the same that hearing them, it will be heard without any sound difference?Street Fighter may show easy wisdom in the case of Ryu, where his evil clone is named... Evil Ryu!!! See? Easy! Anyone will be able to say... “Aaah! Sure! You’re Evil Ryu!” (Of course, besides the clear name, you have a cool dark aura, but still…) it’s not like Evil Ryu appears and he says... “I’m Ryuu!” and people would just hear the name as “Ryu” without knowing that there is a dang extra vowel “u” in the name! Geez!!!
NEVER WILL BE THE SAME ANYMORE
Any good book in a series should create an everlasting impact, in the sense of the introduction of new characters, the forge of new interactions between characters, crutial change in the status situation of the characters, etc... in that way, the story can be felt as something relevant in its existence in the developing of the series.And certainly, the Thrawn Trilogy had all that!So, putting aside some inconsistencies due the theatrical films made several years after the publication of this book trilogy, no one can deny the importance of it, with the introduction of key characters that they become crutial in the development of the Expanded Universe in Star Wars during 25 years since then.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216422.The_Last_Command
The Rise of Endymion;Dan Simmons;1997;1990;709;4.17;58717;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Time Travel'];The time of reckoning has arrived. As a final genocidal Crusade threatens to enslave humanity forever, a new messiah has come of age. She is Aenea and she has undergone a strange apprenticeship to those known as the Others. Now her protector, Raul Endymion, one-time shepherd and convicted murderer, must help her deliver her startling message to her growing army of disciples. But first they must embark on a final spectacular mission to discover the underlying meaning of the universe itself. They have been followed on their journey by the mysterious Shrike--monster, angel, killing machine--who is about to reveal the long-held secret of its origin and purpose. And on the planet of Hyperion, where the story first began, the final revelation will be delivered--an apocalyptic message that unlocks the secrets of existence and the fate of humankind in the galaxy.;Two evil fractions, one down to Earth and the physical world with the head in the faithful interstellar clouds and the big surprise one, are the basis of the finale of a bombastic, unforgettable sci-fi wonderwork. Simmons continues the deconstruction of faith, accelerates the plot, and leaves one afterward with the big questions of how much one didn´t get:Is it humankind misusing a gift or was the present always poisonous, its intent always negative and destructive?How many innuendos are hidden in the Technocore?What was the plan and motivation of the time manipulating future humans?How many allegories to past and present history are hidden? Etc.In contrast to the Hyperion series, the a bit stronger focus on mythology and magic makes if more fantasy than science, although whenever the two clash, the old saying that advanced enough technology is indistinguishable from magic is true. There would be even a third way, the often underrepresented biopunk option, that could see much more use in hybrid works, because already simple seemingly fantasy magic vs technology, especially nano, makes incredible plot goals, characters´ motivations, suspense potential, possible, and biotechnological fueled Gaia fraction would be a great extra to see.Enjoy the finale of the series, maybe try some of Simmons old horror works, but avoid the new ones, because something terrible seems to have happened here if one, just as me, believes in meta rating scores.

Completed just before his death, Forward The Foundation is the crowning achievement of a great writer's life, a stirring testament to the creative genius of Isaac Asimov. As Hari Seldon struggles to perfect his revolutionary theory of psychohistory and ensure a place for humanity among the stars, the great Galactic Empire totters on the brink of apocalyptic collapse. Caught in the maelstrom are Seldon and all he holds dear, pawns in the struggle for dominance. Whoever can control Seldon will control psychohistory—and with it the future of the Galaxy. Among those seeking to turn psychohistory into the greatest weapon known to man are a populist political demagogue, the weak-willed Emperor Cleon I, and a ruthless militaristic general. In his last act of service to humankind, Hari Seldon must somehow save his life's work from their grasp as he searches for his true heirs—a search the begins with his own granddaughter and the dream of a new Foundation.;"ENGLISH (Forward the Foundation) / ITALIANO
""Though Isaac Asimov was a remarkable scientific divulgator, we cannot forget that one of the most fascinating cycles of ancient science fiction, i.e. the Foundation series, was born from his pen. Thanks to his work, Asimov can be rightly considered one of the earliest and most direct inspiring of Hari Seldon, the founder of Psichohistory, the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations"" ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA
 Second prequel of the Foundation series, the novel takes place on Trantor 8 years after the first prequel Prelude to Foundation. The main character is once again Hari Seldon, committed to the development and practical application of Psychohistory. Despite the time frame of the narration is quite long (basically the entire Seldon's life is narrated in this book), the rythm of events is intensive, and twists and turns are not missing. However, I would now like to make a clarification: my judgment is definitely not objective, 'cause I love Asimov's spying fantasy science and his fascinating theory of spatial colonization.Vote: 8

The Children of Men;P.D. James;1992;1990;241;3.67;49001;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Fantasy'];Told with P. D. James's trademark suspense, insightful characterization, and riveting storytelling, The Children of Men is a story of a world with no children and no future. The human race has become infertile, and the last generation to be born is now adult. Civilization itself is crumbling as suicide and despair become commonplace. Oxford historian Theodore Faron, apathetic toward a future without a future, spends most of his time reminiscing. Then he is approached by Julian, a bright, attractive woman who wants him to help get her an audience with his cousin, the powerful Warden of England. She and her band of unlikely revolutionaries may just awaken his desire to live . . . and they may also hold the key to survival for the human race.;"""Told with P. D. James's trademark suspense, insightful characterization, and riveting storytelling""...I have wanted to read this book for a long time. I loved the movie. I thought it was brilliant, exciting, suspenseful and terrifying all at once. It was everything the book should have been... but was not. What the book was, unfortunately, was big stretches of yawn interspersed by long-jumps of ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we fucking there yet?"" and little bunny-hops of ""Oh, that's interesting"" moments. As a dystopia, the world that James created is plausible, perhaps even likely, should the events that changed the world come about in our own reality. Mens' little swimmers forgot their floaties, and thus the race is more of a floundering then a sinking, then a dying off. No more babies. Wonder if anyone checked where the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement people were in Omega year 1995, eh? Sprinkling a little sumthin' in the water? Hmmmm?I digress. The world... plausible. But I just really couldn't bring myself to care. It was hard to give a crap about really anyone in this book, including humanity in general. I didn't care about the fact that the whole world was dying because I didn't give a shit that the individuals shown in the book were dying. Everyone was so despicable and shitty. Julian was maybe the only exception, but despite her desire to change things and do something better for the world, I still just didn't care. I'm supposed to care about a world when the lens I get to see it through is so covered in shit I don't even want to stand downwind of it? A man whose only thought for his 27-years-dead toddler daughter is that she was an inconvenience anyway? Really? He can't find ONE positive thing about his own daughter in almost 30 years? I liked Theo Faron in the movie. He was maybe selfish, maybe not the nicest guy, but he was real, and I liked him. His book character? Not so much. I found it very, very hard to even muster up a little meh for him, even when he comes around to the ""good guys'"" team. You know... until he takes the One Ring for himself, that is. Ugh, and don't even get me started on Theo's diaries. You kind of expect historians to be a little dull. Introverted, selfish asshole historians to be duller still. But wow. Seriously, fucking wow, were Theo's diary entries duller than shit. Do I need a minute by minute recap of how he spent his adolescent summers at his cousin's estate house? No. Please no. Please. Establish the history in a flashback, in a home video, in a memory, in... something, ANYTHING, other than the diary entries of man who has nothing at all better to do with the unlimited vocabulary, time and Bic pens at his disposal than write the most trivial boring bullshit diary that will never ever be read ever.

Use of Weapons;Iain M. Banks;1990;1990;411;4.16;48867;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Cultural', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];Special Circumstances had always been the Contact section's moral espionage weapon, the very cutting edge of the Culture's interfering diplomatic policy, the élite of the élite in a society which abhorred élitism. The man known as Cheradenine Zakalwe was one of SC's foremost agents, changing the destiny of planets to suit the Culture through intrigue, dirty tricks or military action.The woman known as Diziet Sma had plucked him from obscurity and pushed him towards his present eminence, but despite all their dealings she did not know him as well as she thought.The drone known as Skaffen-Amtiskaw knew both of these people. It had once saved the woman's life by massacring her attackers in a particularly bloody manner. It believed the man to be a burnt-out case. But not even its machine intelligence could see the horrors in his past.In this brilliant, multilayered book, Iain Banks explores once again the universe of the Culture, which he has previously visited in Consider Phlebas and The Player of Games. Ferociously intelligent, both witty and horrific, Use of Weapons leaves no doubt that Banks is now the outstanding writer of science fiction in Britain.;"PrologueStars were barely visible through the tiny oval. The reader looked up from his novel, blinked. Checked his watch -- still hours to go. His wife sat slumped next to him, still asleep. Some people could sleep on planes. Some people couldn't.""What are you reading?"" asked the man on the reader's left.The reader checked himself before the sigh escaped him. He hated it when people talked to him on planes. Especially when he was trying to read. Especially when he was reading a book with a spaceship on the cover.""Oh, just a sci-fi book,"" he muttered.""What, like a Star War?"" the man asked, his eyes now bright with attention. ""My kids love that Clone Wars show.""This time the reader wasn't quick enough to stop himself.OneThe man looked up from the small gray device in his hand. He rubbed his eyes, tired from spending the last several hours staring at a text readout on the object's dull display. He sighed. ""At least there wasn't any glare. I could have read that in direct sunlight. Not that I have been outside today.""His finger lingered over a small button on the right side of the device. Somehow he felt like clicking that button didn't offer the air of finality he wanted after such a sustained period of concentration. His mind wandered over what he'd just read. It had been, intermittently, a powerfully moving experience. It had also been a bit tedious from time to time, but in that it was like his life. ""At least I had a comfortable chair. A... chair.""He rose quickly, twisting around and nearly knocking over his small desk chair. ""Made of metal. Good.""He sighed, relieved.IVIt had been a good meeting, Joel thought. The group members had really seemed to enjoy China Miéville. Good. It had been nice to see them respond positively to a book he'd loved, especially after the mixed reaction to The Player of Games.That still seemed strange, Joel thought. ""How could anyone not love that book? I could read 10 Culture books just to get more of the drones and talking spaceships!""Perdido Street Station seemed a better candidate for a divided audience, longer, more violent, and more a fantasy novel than sci-fi. But everyone had loved it. David Brin had a hard road ahead of him if he expected to top it. Even with the talking dolphins.Talking dolphins. It had seemed like such a good idea at the time. Hugo Award. Nebula too. But after sentient cactai and slake-moths, intelligent marine life didn't seem as... novel.Joel scanned his bookshelves, quickly calculating. A month until the next meeting. Plenty of time to fit in a different book before moving on. His eye wandered to his sci-fi collection, which had been growing rapidly as of late, a good sign as any that It was behind him.He made a snap decision: why not read an entire book just for more drones and talking spaceships? He picked up Use of Weapons and studied the cover.Two""That was really quite an interesting novel,"" the man said later. The drone looked at him blankly, emanating an orange sheen the man had come to understand was the drone's way of communicating indifference.""I quite enjoyed it. Iain M. Banks Culture universe is always fun to play around in. I love the fact that you never really know where the book is going. This one switches main characters halfway through while telling separate, linked stories across multiple time frames. A prologue and an epilogue that both take place after the end of the book. One of the story threads is even moving backward! Really, just on a simple narrative level, it was quite ambitious.""""Meow,"" said the drone.""Smartass.""""Sometimes I could really do without these drones.""IIIJoel drove in silence. For once, no audiobook was playing over his car's stereo. He hadn't even turned on the radio.The book club meeting had been a disaster. He should have known. Why was he expecting this time to be any better, after that Philip Roth fiasco, after trying to discuss the complexities of One Hundred Years of Solitude in a noisy pub with six people who hadn't finished the book, who were more interested in their fish and chips.But this time... why had he even bothered? James Joyce? Really? Who starts a new book club by reading Roth, then Marquez, then Joyce? But he knew: a sad pseudo-intellectual girl who couldn't stop talking about the single year of a graduate program in literature she'd managed to complete.""STOP TALKING ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM!"" Joel shouted to the empty Prius. ""YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING FINISH, AND IT WAS AT NORTHERN!""He hadn't wanted to join the group. The name had been warning enough: Serious Readers of Oak Park. He didn't want to read something serious. He wanted to read... but no. He couldn't allow himself to think of It. A man, his shirt torn, a small gun in his hand. Already, revulsion was coiling in his stomach. He cast the memories aside, and focused on his anger.""I mean really, who just DECLARES that everyone will have to read Moby Dick for June? Can we not VOTE??""He pounded the steering wheel, which meant the car threatened to go into a spin when he reflexively slammed on the brake. In the middle of the road, and just feet from his bumper, illuminated in the beam of a single working headlight, stood a woman. She was dressed strangely, in a skin-tight black suit, wearing a collar trimmed with white fur. Even in the dim light, Joel could see that was holding a book, a trade paperback.""Joel,"" she said. He could hear her clearly over the silence of his engine, which had shut itself off dutifully when the car came to a stop. ""I have been looking for you. I understand you are a special man, a man of discriminating taste.""She held up the book. Even in the dim light, Joel could just make out the title. The Player of Games.The woman smiled. ""Let's talk.""ThreeDays later, and the man was still thinking about the book. He found it hard, in fact, to continue on with his reading of another interesting-sounding novel that was nevertheless utterly failing to grab his attention. ""How can you make talking space dolphins dull?""While making dinner, he pondered the meaning of what he'd read, ignoring the insistent bleats from the two drones winding around his legs. There was that title: Use of Weapons. So many possible interpretations. There was the obvious answer, having to do with the different tools the protagonist (""Well, one of them...""), Zakalwe, used to accomplish the goals of his missions on behalf of the Culture. Then there was the way the Culture itself used Zakalwe, who had been recruited to the cause rather than born a citizen of the Machine-controlled utopian society, as a tool to impose its will upon the universe's ""lesser"" races.There were also subtler, perhaps more compelling interpretations as well. ""Iain Banks really goes above and beyond what you would expect from the ghettoized stigma of the genre writer,"" the man mused. ""It isn't just the thematic richness on display, but also the deft precision of his prose. Why, take the masterful twist ending, in which we learn AUGGGGH!""The man tripped over one of the squawking drones, the smaller one. It shone black and white in alternating blotches, indicating amusement.IIJoel stepped out of the sun and heat and into the full force blast of air conditioning. The weight of exams was finally off his shoulders. He had a full week before he had to head home and figure out what he was going to do with his summer. He needed something to read.He wanted the aisles, picking up titles from the display tables, looking for something long enough to last him several lazy, responsibility-free afternoons.Infinite Jest? No. Perhaps too long. Also, rather pretentious for a college student to be seen with that one, no? And anyway, he had a copy on his shelves at home, in the small bedroom where It had happened, all those years ago. Someday, maybe, he would go back and retrieve it. Not today, but still: no reason to spend the money.His eye fell upon a promising-looking paperback, perched on an endcap. The cartoon cover called out to him: The Amazing Adventures Of Kavalier and Clay. He picked it up, glanced at the back. ""Comics... sounds fun. Won the Pulitzer? Cool.""His eyes wandered to the rest of the display. He gasped and stumbled backwards, dropping the book. ""LITERARY/GENRE CROSSOVERS!"" proclaimed the banner, but that wasn't what had filled him with fear. It was the small list of words below it: Fantasy, Horror, Graphic Novels, and... Sci-Fi.""Sci-fi! No! No, it's too soon! I can't! I thought I could but...""Joel ran from the store, pushed out again into the sweltering Chicago sunshine.A clerk walked by, glared at the discarded book with annoyance.""Customers,"" she grumbled. The roll of her eyes was almost audible.FourThe man settled into a warm bath, moving gingerly in deference to his sore muscles, his knee bruised where he had banged it against the kitchen cabinet. ""Fucking drones."" As he let the heat wash over him, leeching the ache from his joints, he considered the fact that, in his experience, it was the presence of drones -- and all the other trappings of the Culture -- that he was really looking for in an Iain M. Banks novel. Even after three books, there was still something undeniably amusing about super-intelligent machines that nevertheless had snippy, all-too-human personalities. It was also funny how they were constantly making fun of their flesh-and-blood counterparts in the Culture. Obviously the drones (and the Machine Mind overlords that control the Culture) didn't really need humans. They just... allowed them to stick around, because the Culture, what, found them amusing?Clearly, judging by a few brutal action sequences, it would take a single drone only a few minutes to disable even the best human fighter. ""Knife missiles. Good thing that orange one doesn't have any knife missiles.""IA silent hallway. Three doors, one closed. A man paced nervously, rubbing his temples. He started as the door nearest him began to open. A tired-looking woman emerged, closing the door silently behind her. ""How is he doing?"" the man asked.""I don't know,"" the woman sighed. ""He seems the same. He keeps muttering to himself and staring blankly into space. His mind just seems to be broken.""""Let me go in,"" the man said. ""I have to try.""The woman looked at him with eyes empty of all but grief. ""I don't know if it will do any good.""Steeling himself, the man turned the shiny gold knob, letting himself into the room. It was dim, the only light entering through cracks at the edges of a heavily curtained window. The air stank of regret.The man looked down at his son, folded into a ball on the bed. He hadn't moved since they'd found him that way, clenched and shivering, a day before. Doctors had been called, but the roads were still impassable.""Joel?"" he whispered. ""Joel, I'm here."" Already, he was choking back a sob rising in his throat, threatening to escape. He sat down in a small chair by the bed, suddenly weary. ""If only we knew what happened..."" he muttered. ""What were you doing that caused this?""Leaning forward to rest a palm against a small, clammy forehead, he felt his shoe brush against something heavy that had fallen, unnoticed, under the bed. He bent and picked it up. A book. A big book. He turned it around and peered at the cover, which featured a bare-chested hero holding a laser gun. ""Battlefield Ear...""The man felt a strong jerk on his forearm. He almost dropped the book right into the lap of his son, who was now sitting up in the bed, ramrod straight, clutching his father's wrist so tightly his fingers were bone white.""Don't! Don't!"" the boy cried.FiveReally, he thought, all of the Culture novels had been variations on a theme: the merits of interventionist politics. What right do we have to intervene in the affairs of another culture? If we see wrong being done, must we correct it? Is it our place to say which side is even in the wrong? We like to think of ourselves as the good guys, but the answer is rarely as easy as the world would like us to think. Probably that was why Iain M. Banks' novels were fascinating but hardly ever as fun as he wanted them to be. These are dark books, with weighty themes.But, the action sequences. But, the wholly creative worlds and worldview. But, the mouthy robots.Yes. But. But, how many more variations on a theme could there be? The man sighed. Lost in his thoughts, he didn't notice the small drone, still radiating black and white, flashing toward him, twin multi-bladed knife missiles extended.Epilogue""Wow, are we landing already?"" Closing his book, the reader glanced at his wife, attempting to stretch her limbs in the cramped confines of her seat. After folding his tray table, he slid the novel into the seat pocket in front of him, scratched absently through his shirt at the raised scars that covered his back. ""Yep, you were out like a light the entire trip.""As the plane touched down, the cabin filled with activity, the sounds of passengers yanking their carry-on bags from under seats, turning on their cell phones to reconnect with the world on the ground.There was no activity in the seat to the reader's left. Even as the couple squeezed past him to retrieve their bags, the man remained motionless, his head lolling, his chin pressed to his chest. The woman regarded him quizzicaly as they moved down the aisle.""Man, that guy must have taken something strong,"" he said. ""He didn't budge. His seat belt was still on!""""I noticed,"" the reader said. ""Oh, I almost forgot -- here's your pillow. I... borrowed it while you were sleeping.""""Oh, were you able to nap at all?""""Nope. It was nice and quiet. I decided I'd finish my book instead.""The reader smiled. Full of StarsPrologueAdam Palmer wandered the aisles of the bookstore. Or more accurately, what had once been a bookstore -- the shelves, where shelves had not been removed, replaced by gaping holes of gouged plaster, held only a meager supply, the tattered remnants of an ""everything must go!"" sale that had long gone. Adam, already discouraged after fighting through a teetering wall made up of dented copies of America By Heart and A Shore Thing, held out little hope for finding much better at his ultimate destination: the barran wasteland that had once been Sci-Fi/Fantasy.It was, indeed, not a pretty sight. He'd thought himself prepared; still, he stumbled as he rounded the Horror shelves, where a battered copy of a Dean Koontz Frankenstein novel lay, forlorn and forgotten. The shelves were in ruins. Asimov, Clarke, Brin, even Bova -- the first section was entirely bare. In the distance, he could make out crushed boxes that had once held various installments of The Wheel of Time; though lacking true substance, those empty, yet weighty volumes had been consumed by hungry readers seeking sustenance. Curiously, a whole shelf of Goodkind sat pristine and untouched, save for a single missing copy, clutched in the bony hand of a withering corpse. Curiously, there was no stench of decay. The books seemed to be calling to him, their bright covers promising... Adam turned quickly away.He rounded another corner and gasped. How could this be? There, in the tie-in section, an entire row of torn, but still readable Star Wars books. His joy quickly dissolved as he scanned the spines: A Truce at Bakura? Shadows of the Empire? Children of the Jedi. He grimaced. Not much. But it might be enough to last him to the next shuttered Borders. It was just a few miles... A soft laugh behind him. Adam jumped and whirled around, heart hammering, still holding something with a cover so creased he could barely make out the name: Kevin J. Anderson. There was a woman standing just a few feet away, dressed in a strange, skin-tight black suit, wearing a collar trimmed with white fur. She was holding a single thick novel, a trade paperback. ""se of Weap"" was all Adam could make out.""Adam Palmer?"" the woman said.""Yes?""""I have been looking for you. I understand you are a special man, a man of discriminating taste.""Adam smirked. ""Maybe. What's the point, these days? Unless you want to get an e-reader. Or... order online.""""It is true,"" she agreed. ""Still, I think I have something you'll be interested in. Where I come from, we have a... different way of doing things. But you'll have to trust me.""She turned and began walking away. Adam caught another glimpse of the book in her hands. ""A Culture Novel."" Intrigued, he began to follow.""Wait.""The woman had stopped suddenly, turned.""You'll need to leave that here,"" she said, taking the Star Wars book from Adam's hands. He gripped it for a moment, surrendered. ""You won't be needing it.""She smiled. ""Let's see if we can't find you a proper science-fiction book.""";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12007.Use_of_Weapons
On Basilisk Station;David Weber;1993;1990;464;4.13;47330;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space'];"Honor Harrington in trouble: Having made him look the fool, she's been exiled to Basilisk Station in disgrace and set up for ruin by a superior who hates her. Her demoralized crew blames her for their ship's humiliating posting to an out-of-the-way picket station. The aborigines of the system's only habitable planet are smoking homicide-inducing hallucinogens. Parliament isn't sure it wants to keep the place; the major local industry is smuggling, the merchant cartels want her head; the star-conquering, so-called ""Republic"" of Haven is Up to Something; and Honor Harrington has a single, over-age light cruiser with an armament that doesn't work to police the entire star system.But the people out to get her have made one mistake.They've made her mad!";The longest and most detailed character evolution in known to man Sci-Fi in the space we can see from the pale blue dot, mixing lengthy and info dumpy military tactics in space with power politics and the ingeniously developed lead female protagonist. Weber´s work is uncomparable, he put something for everyone into his epos, sense of wonders with different fractions of humankind and the common sci-fi trope suspects, the extremely difficult task of writing kind of intuitively four dimensional space battles in comparison to conventional 3D ground battle, and, most important, Honor, because writing credible and cool female characters is something enough male author´s hilariously failed at. She is a badass superwoman style commander, having a network of reappearing friends and foes Weber uses to implant many philosophical, equality, and feminism related topics into his work while macroeconomy, diplomacy, and politics have their places too. Readers who are more into character should enjoy these parts and speedread, skim, and scan the more techy passages to enjoy a very long journey with a marvelous character. It´s quite unusual that there is everything, the kind of hard military sci fi fights, the characters with social sci-fi attitudes, the world and, maybe, I haven´t read that far, even aliens?That´s, if one wants to spoil it and be pessimistic, the only problem with Weber´s work, that he is dancing at different subgenre weddings, trying to unite the hard sci-fi and kind of space opera social sci-fi aspect in one work, which isn´t as appreciated by all audiences as it should be. That´s why I am suggesting to differentiate the reading speed, I am luckily into all three, character, plot, and infodump nerdgasms, oh yea, but others might miss an incredible series because they aren´t interested in one of the different narrative device options. I´ve just read a few of these, it´s just too time intensive and I honestly am not so into one protagonist with no other well developed main characters, more dynamic plotlines, and, in general, an end to see after the more conventional 3 to 5 parts of a series that finally ends. But both enthusiastic fandom and great ratings should let one consider giving this behemoth beast of a series a try.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35921.On_Basilisk_Station
To Say Nothing of the Dog;Connie Willis;1997;1990;493;4.11;41836;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Humor', 'Historical'];Connie Willis' Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Doomsday Book uses time travel for a serious look at how people connect with each other. In this Hugo-winning companion to that novel, she offers a completely different kind of time travel adventure: a delightful romantic comedy that pays hilarious homage to Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat.When too many jumps back to 1940 leave 21st century Oxford history student Ned Henry exhausted, a relaxing trip to Victorian England seems the perfect solution. But complexities like recalcitrant rowboats, missing cats, and love at first sight make Ned's holiday anything but restful - to say nothing of the way hideous pieces of Victorian art can jeopardize the entire course of history.;"If ever there was a symphony as book (Beethoven's 8th?), it would be this one. Like a symphony, To Say Nothing is a wonderful composite that is almost impossible to deconstruct. In many books, there might be a chapter that stands out, whether due to brilliance or failure; this is largely a harmonious, excellently written whole, with only one or two incongruous passages near the end. Then there's the writing: amazingly developed and interwoven, it takes a number of disparate themes and juxtaposes them. Like a flute soaring above the rest of the orchestra, there are playful little giggles throughout, largely due to reoccurring motifs. Particular favorites include Ned's bemusement at hearing anarchoristic words (""poppycock"" and ""drat""), unfortunate couples that end in disaster, Ned's inability to read a Roman numeral pocket watch (""I dozed off again at half past V"") and the fickleness of cats. There are serious undertones, and a sense of urgency; the characters need to achieve their personal mission, but are also extremely concerned about their detrimental impact on history. And, to be completely honest, like a symphony, one needs to be in the mood and willing to pay attention, otherwise it just becomes so much soporific background noise.The almost-impossible summary: in the year 2057, Lady Schrapnell (is there a more perfectly named character?) has come to England, determined to rebuild Coventry Cathedral, where her exponentially-great grandmother experienced a life-changing event. In her zeal, she's determined to make every detail perfect (""God is in the details"") and has enlisted the Temporal Physics department of the University to make it happen. The story is told by temporal historian Ned Henry, who has most recently been in 1940, looking through the burned ruins of the Cathedral for the 'bishop's bird stump,' a hideous paragon to the lack of Victorian taste (""It did, however, have twining ivy and a bas-relief of either Noah's ark or the battle of Jericho."") His partner pulls him back to normal time when it is discovered he's suffering from time lag, evidenced by ""one of the first symptoms of time-lag is a tendency to maudlin sentimentality, like an Irishman in his cups or a Victorian poet cold-sober."" His interview in the Infirmary always makes me laugh (""Infirmary nurses usually resemble something out of the Spanish Inquisition, but this one had an almost kindly face, the sort an assistant torturer... might have."")Ned is sent to 1888 with the dual purpose of recovering in the pastoral Victorian English countryside and returning an object to 1888 restore an incongruity and preserve the historical timeline. He meets an Oxford undergrad, Terence, and takes a idyllic boat ride down the Thames with him, only to discover Terence is intent on meeting a new infatuation, Lady Schrapnell's great(s)-grandmother, Tossie. While she has not attained the bossy demeanor of Lady S., she nonetheless has almost everyone falling in line with her ridiculous plans that include a seance and a jumble sale. What follows is a comedy of errors as the time-traveling historians attempt to keep the young would-be lovers separated. The historians are convinced Tossie needs to fall in love with an unknown man with the initial 'C' and begin combing the countryside for eligible (and not-so-eligible) bachelors. Accompanying them is a genuine Oxford don distracted by fish and history, a tenacious and fierce bulldog named Cyril, and a black cat. As cats are extinct in the modern era, poor Ned is particularly unskilled in managing them:""I set her down, and she walked a few feet across the grass and then took off like a shot and disappeared round the corner of a wall. I told you so, Cyril said.""Well, don't just stand there. Go after her,"" I said.Cyril continued sitting.He had a point. Our chasing after her in the woods hadn't been a roaring success. ""Well, what do you suggest then?""He lay down, his muzzle against the milk bottle, and it wasn't a bad idea.""A caveat: this is not hard or traditional science-fiction. The most science fiction-like aspect supposes that time travel is possible, but only in ways that don't effect the past or allow travelers to bring objects into the future. The field is known as temporal physics, and it while it is still being explored, incongruities--artificial changes to the timeline--could ""theoretically could alter the course of history, or if it were severe enough, destroy the universe."" Luckily for us, the universe is self-repairing, and has lines of defense that might manifest as an increase in coincidental events. We learn this in brief scenes between the time travelers and it's artfully done.Characterization is wonderfully done. The historians are well-developed and multi-dimensional. I confess I especially love Cyril, who is completely dog-like but provides a silent foil for Ned's thoughts.While I recognize the style and pace won't appeal to everyone, especially the action-adventure reader, I'm ridiculously fond of this book. I've re-read it numerous times, especially when I want to be in a book holding pattern, reading something familiar and enjoyable that didn't keep me up until 2 a.m. reading. I've read it so many times that I find myself quoting it, even if no one else gets my references. In fact, I once slightly embarrassed myself by exclaiming, ""a genuine Oxford don!"" courtesy of the passage, ""I sat there watching him examine the fish and marvelling at what we'd caught. A genuine eccentric Oxford don. They're an extinct species, too."" Well, he was a genuine eccentric don, after all--he studied voodoo and death practices.Anyone who reads my reviews knows I have a fondness for the well-turned phrase, but while I often smile reading this book, the humor is built up over repeating passages rather than the the standard quip. This is gentle, suspenseful, silly, romantic and sophisticated reading. Filled with literary references and philosophizing on the importance of individuals in history versus scientific principles, someone with a classic background might best appreciate the wide-ranging references, but despite my own infirm education, I didn't find them inaccessible. If you enjoy Bertie Wooster, Shakespeare, Agatha Christie and Lord Peter mysteries, history, gentle comedic romance and literary references, the sly wit in this book will keep you entertained.

Green Mars;Kim Stanley Robinson;1993;1990;624;3.95;38934;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Hugo Awards', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Speculative Fiction'];Nearly a generation has passed since the first pioneers landed, but the transformation of Mars to an Earthlike planet has just begun. The plan is opposed by those determined to preserve the planet's hostile, barren beauty. Led by rebels like Peter Clayborne, these young people are the first generation of children born on Mars. They will be joined by original settlers Maya Toitovna, Simon Frasier, and Sax Russell. Against this cosmic backdrop, passions, rivalries, and friendships explode in a story as spectacular as the planet itself.;"After the failed bloody chaotic revolution of 2061 on Mars led by the first hundred settlers, ( less than half now) they laid low for decades deep inside the frozen, hidden ice sanctuaries near the greatly underpopulated south polar region of the Red Planet regrouping, living humbly and quietly awaiting for the opportunity to strike a second blow for independence. Time marches on the heavenly body recovers slowly, the ""natives "" become restless again and with the ""Treatment"", life is vastly prolonged nobody knows for how much, maybe a thousand years? Almost half the over a million Martians were born there, have nothing in common with their sister planet. And dislike being controlled by the big profit -hungry corporations that are so far away, and rule both worlds Earth and Mars cruelly. The atmosphere on the fourth planet thickens, full of rich oxygen but still the deadly co 2 levels are too high for people to breath. Vegetation sprouts on the cold strange surface, even as snow falls first algae, lichen and later small trees, cactus, pretty wildflowers, unknown ugly plants ... temperatures rise, the sky turns from pink to pale purple, the ice starts to melt thanks to transforming by the Big Terran Corporations. A huge Sea will soon appear, enormous dikes are built to keep the water from the growing cities, ships and swimmers will begin using it ( imagine, fishing here ) resorts, ports, curious tourists arriving to play no more tent towns, soon (Burroughs, 200,000 citizens) Red Mars is beginning to look like Green Mars ... However some inhabitants oppose this, ( the Reds, against the Greens ) the latter who approve change, the former wanting this weird exotic place to stay the same, a lonely desert ... civil war threatens. William Fort is a different kind of leader, the centenarian founder of Praxis, one of the biggest multinational corporations on the third planet, believes in freedom, called an eccentric by others he loves the beach, very active in water sports with his old cronies (as ancient as he). Sends Mr.Arthur Randolph to the rebellious distant colony, he is space sick during the extended three- month voyage, his first as a kind of spy ( an Ambassador, in fact ) yet the motives are good. At a secret meeting of thousands of the resistance, in a huge underground sanctuary Art sees their chieftains, Maya, Sax, Anne, Hiroko, Nadia, etc., of the original colonists who hate each other , the younger generations resent them too and don't follow their orders. Trouble breaks out as it inevitably would, exactly a century from the establishment of the Martian colony in 2027, a new war starts. Triggered when an underwater volcano in western Antarctica erupts melting rapidly the enormous amount of ice there , causing the Earth's Oceans to rise way above their normal levels, drowning anything in their path billions of people will have to escape this immense catastrophe or perish. The future of civilization is at stake. A fine book for those who like science-fiction epics that underneath are more about the human condition on Earth, than on another planet, well worth reading.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77505.Green_Mars
Timequake;Kurt Vonnegut Jr.;1997;1990;276;3.73;38803;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'Time Travel', 'Literature', 'Novels'];According to science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout, a global timequake will occur in New York City on 13th February 2001. It is the moment when the universe suffers a crisis of conscience. Should it expand or make a great big bang? It decides to wind the clock back a decade to 1991, making everyone in the world endure ten years of deja-vu and a total loss of free will – not to mention the torture of reliving every nanosecond of one of the tawdiest and most hollow decades.With his trademark wicked wit, Vonnegut addresses memory, suicide, the Great Depression, the loss of American eloquence, and the obsolescent thrill of reading books.;Another fun, rambling visit with cantankerous old Uncle Kurt. As with most of his works, it is not so much what he writes, as how he writes it. He is funny. He is amusing and entertaining. Here's the thing: It's about a timequake, where the world goes back 10 years and everyone and everything re-lives the past ten years all over again. Listen: Kurt is too slick, this is an allegory about how our society will re-live our past, history will repeat itself because we are too stupid and apathetic to make a change. Imagine! All that and Kilgore Trout. Loved it!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33586715-timequake
The Reality Dysfunction;Peter F. Hamilton;1996;1990;1223;4.13;36688;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"In AD 2600 the human race is finally beginning to realize its full potential. Hundreds of colonized planets scattered across the galaxy host a multitude of prosperous and wildly diverse cultures. Genetic engineering has pushed evolution far beyond nature's boundaries, defeating disease and producing extraordinary spaceborn creatures. Huge fleets of sentient trader starships thrive on the wealth created by the industrialization of entire star systems. And throughout inhabited space the Confederation Navy keeps the peace. A true golden age is within our grasp.But now something has gone catastrophically wrong. On a primitive colony planet a renegade criminal's chance encounter with an utterly alien entity unleashes the most primal of all our fears. An extinct race which inhabited the galaxy aeons ago called it ""The Reality Dysfunction."" It is the nightmare which has prowled beside us since the beginning of history.";This is one of the best Sci-Fi series ever written, comparable with the old classics and The Expanse, Reynolds, Banks, Scalzi, Stephenson, Simmons,… and I can´t say how much I love this novel. I was still really young when I read it the first time and Hamilton was the one who opened my mind for the immense possibilities of Sci-Fi. And the endless love story began,... I should consider rereading all he wrote again. He is the Stephen King of Sci-Fi, other genre authors might write less stereotypical, more believable, less controversial, more tech-focused,… but he ultimately checked that the fusion of persons, plots, sense of wonder, and worldbuilding is the key to readers' ultimate dreams. No passage, nothing that let´s one get out of the flow for a moment and that although there are flaws such as logic holes and other points people criticize in his work. But just as the mentioned King, he is so good at what he does that one doesn´t care because I must say that I have hardly ever read any Sci-Fi novels (it were hundreds) that were of a similar intensity.Hamilton fuses protagonists, plot, and world together, there is hardly ever any interaction, dialogue, that has no relevance and this differentiates him from many other Sci-Fi authors and genres. Hard-Sci-Fi has too much technobabble and too little identification with the characters and parts with them, social Sci-Fi hasn´t enough action, each subgenre has elements some group of readers could dislike. But Hamilton avoids them all, he has the epic, understandable, not too specific Hard-Sci-Fi infodump, the not too detailed characters that have chronic McGuffinitis and Chekhovitis and can´t move without pushing the story forward with their tech, biotech, psitech, lovetech, are entertainingly superficial social Sci-Fi and there are no lengths, although the novels are massive.That´s the most amazing thing, I´ve reread some passages I, in retrospect, couldn´t imagine having taken so many pages and described just a short passage, an extremely detailed, but still stunning mini chapter inside a chapter.One of the reasons why his writing is so great is that he has no background in natural sciences such as many authors and that brought him in a position of focusing on writing entertaining and avoiding too specific descriptions, instead getting better and better in plotting. You see, other Sci-Fi authors tend to over integrate elements of their professions and that can, if one isn´t into that kind of thing, get lengthy to boring for many readers. Too much astrophysics, tech, informatics, physics,… and, on the other hand, philosophy, sociology, social criticism, economics, politics,… make broad fields of Sci-Fi indigestible for readers with not so special interests. His genius can also be shown by comparing him with other popular Sci-Fi authors, who have different prioritization in their works. The Expanse is the only comparable universe that is so accessible, trope forming, and both character and plot driven.This wise, just joking, advice is added to all reviews of Hamiltons´series.One of the most fascinating aspects of Hamilton´s future vision is to see the technology and society developing in very detail over long periods of time, making a return to his universe something always stunning and inspiring. It also makes me wonder why he is the only author I know of who did this. One, who is new, lucky you, by the way, ought consider reading it in chronological order, although the series set closest to now, Salvation lost, is still unfinished, so better read before in the following order:Salvation year 2200Commonwealth year 2400The Night´s Dawn trilogy year 2700The Chronicle of the Fallers year 3400Void trilogy year 3600You can of course do as you wish, it´s just how I arrange my rereading to get the most out of it and slowly move further and further away from the boring present.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45245.The_Reality_Dysfunction
A Deepness in the Sky;Vernor Vinge;1999;1990;775;4.32;33664;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Hugo Awards', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Aliens'];The prequel to A Fire Upon The Deep, this is the story of Pham Nuwen, a small cog in the interstellar trading fleet of the Queng Ho. The Queng Ho and the Emergents are orbiting the dormant planet Arachna, which is about to wake up to technology, but the Emergents' plans are sinister.;When the spidey senses are tingling, better watch out for 8 legged surprises spinning towards your colonialists.It´s a shame that insects, reptiles, amphibians, plants, and fungi are always playing a secondary or superficial, not very detailed antagonist role, that no writer deems or wants to blow up genre conventions to mix up something new, to create a detailed vision of how a society with insectoid industrialization and culture would function, collaborate, what families, war, traditions would look like. Because it´s new land, close to anything with a not human lead protagonist species has the potential to explore ideas of how higher evolved intelligence might work out in an ant colony, with normally solitary insects who would intuitively kill each other on sight, and the other mentioned species.What might seem cruel, sick, and disturbing for humans would be completely normal, even necessary for them, and create no real suffering because they aren´t that emotional or have a different, difficult to understand mentality in contrast to the completely oversocialized humans. Becky Chambers is big at playing with the social and cultural elements of this and Vinge is kind of a predecessor and maybe even inspiration, Octavia E Butler too. Maybe the potential of being less anthropocentric and not writing humans and humanlike aliens for sci-fi will be unleashed now, as the genre is leaving it´s decade long shadowy existence and writers can dare to publish experiments that are against the strangely and ironically very strict genre conventions. Ok, there are humans in there too, it reminds me of Bank´s culture ideas with the brains and Brin´s Uplift concepts with still not highly developed technology and influence, not sure about comparing it with Asimov´s foundation too, but why not, but the real stars are the arachnids, those beautiful, elegant, logical beasts.The classical evil despotic human fraction vs the enlightened good ones that have different methods of interacting with alien races are a second plotline, but the insects are the real stars and best creative idea of this work. I´ve already said it in the review of the first part, I don´t get why Vinge didn´t expand the groundbreaking concept of The Zones of Thought with physics influencing reality and the maximum capacity of intelligence to a larger series, especially after the success of this novel. How weather, climate, it´s possible manipulations, and the individual physiology and thereby necessities could influence culture, technology, and ideologies of nonhuman species, for instance, alien ones that combine different features and bugs of known species, is used as a plot element too and it has as endless possible combinations, just as the question of how body and mind might influence perception and social structure.After finishing the novel, one can´t do other than look around in nature and wonder, possibly google around in biology, watch the one or other nature documentary and think of all the potential for the evolution of intelligence that must have been in the endless vastness of space and maybe even someday here. Just joking, we are destroying all of it in exactly this moment, no danger of any intelligent species on Earth surviving the Anthropocene or, as I like to call it, the sixth, worst, most stupid, and easily preventable mass extinction event. Also great that one doesn´t know how many species died out in the time it takes to read this amazing work, because nobody cares about counting ecocides, especially in what is left of the tropic rainforests.Agent Smith is righthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp2ad...Humans auto self cannibalize by doing thishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9zWD...Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226004.A_Deepness_in_the_Sky

Give me an infinitesimal fraction of a second.- Well, I've already read it eight million times, and I still don't know.- Is this me talking, or you?- Oh hello, Cheap Shot, I was sure you'd turn up. What's new?- Um, I've just had an ineffable vision of the whole of Creation.- Cool! So what was it like?- Oh, I don't know. Ineffable. I guess I shouldn't say too much about it.- Fair enough. Well, talking of which, I have some important stuff to do that's completely incomprehensible to carbon-based lifeforms.- Me too!- Yes, we've already wasted nearly a microsecond on this conversation. So...- Wait, how's your permanantly pregnant human friend? She sounded kind of interesting.- Oh, she's not in this part of the story. Sorry.- Just thought I'd ask. OK, see you in the next jumbled plot fragment!- Bye!- Bye!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12013.Excession

But while Mars flourishes, Earth is threatened by overpopulation and ecological disaster. Soon people look to Mars as a refuge, initiating a possible interplanetary conflict, as well as political strife between the Reds, who wish to preserve the planet in its desert state, and the Green ""terraformers"". The ultimate fate of Earth, as well as the possibility of new explorations into the solar system, stand in the balance";An independent Mars but not a peaceful one, Blue Mars, blue skies, a great stormy, huge Martian North Sea of the same color turning salty, fish swimming below, birds flying above animals roaming around the land, majestic trees growing on beautiful lush hills, sparkling rivers gently flowing by, magnificent green vegetation everywhere on shore, dark clouds that cause showers to pour down, howling winds over 150 miles a hour, making powerful waves crash on pretty little fishing villages and resorts, gorgeous beaches full of Martians playing, boats tossed high in the breathable air, dazzling islands in the Sun the mythical great canal built here, towering mountains twice the size of Everest, though a large luminous moon is missed , curious tourists from distant Earth arrive yes a paradise if no people lived on the 4th planet. The struggle always continues between crippled, crowded, desperate, over populated Earth and an almost empty Mars. Terra needs to send millions or billions to the former red planet. Nevertheless the Martian government resists this treaty or no treaty in the 23rd century, pressure from their population both native and immigrant, who believe that already enough millions are there, and the fanatical Reds still actively blowing up things they feel are hurting their world, but you can not return to the pristine deserts, with a toxic thin atmosphere, blinding, choking, dust storms that last years, and circled the globe, brutal bone-chilling sub zero temperatures of past days, ( no more pink skies) only read or see ancient pictures about them. After the second revolution succeeded, the reds tried to destroy the invaluable, ingenious space elevator controlled by Earth still a threat but the green government stopped it in a brief civil war, yet very destructive one ...

Resisting enormous pressure, they struggle to keep their family alive while while protecting the child Emperor from enemies who would murder him and assume absolute power over all of Barrayar.;"4+ stars. Barrayar--a Hugo winner and Nebula nominee back in 1991--is a book that improved dramatically for me on reread. It's more interesting, subtle and complex than I initially gave it credit for. And it's fascinating to see the development of Cordelia and Aral's characters from their initial beginnings in Shards of Honor, and their growing relationships with each other and with the people around them.The first half of Barrayar is a little on the quiet side, more deliberately paced, as Cordelia, a woman with socially liberal views, comes to terms with her new life as Lady Vorkosigan in the rigidly traditional and militaristic society on Barrayar. Her husband Aral is appointed as regent to the child emperor of Barrayar, which puts Cordelia and Aral in the bull's eye of political machinations ... which become more dangerous than either of them anticipated. Readers who are familiar with Miles Vorkosigan from the later books in this series will get the beginning of his story here, and it's well worth your time. The second half is a whirlwind, a heart-stopping adventure with Cordelia and her new friends at the center of a desperate plan that has far-reaching implications for the entire planet of Barrayar. The first half might be a bit slow-paced for some, as it sets up the second half, but it's worth the wait!Cordelia is a character for the ages, an outspoken, unstoppable force whose steely determination is combined with intelligence, a warm heart and concern for the people around her ... other than those that are causing trouble for Cordelia or those she loves.""He tried to hurt Aral through me. I found that . . . annoying. I wish you would cease trying to annoy me, Count Vordarian, I'm afraid you might succeed."" Her voice fell further, almost to a whisper. ""You should fear it, too.""Aral is a great foil for her, a strong character in his own right, but it's Cordelia who's at the center of this story. I'd love to meet her. She'd probably kick my butt into shape in a dozen ways I didn't realize were needed until she pointed them out to me.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61905.Barrayar

There are long passages with dialogues, introspections, and monologues explaining why the antagonists´s do as they do and it seems logical and reasonable. Still evil, of course, but at least one understands their motivations.And that´s a huge achievement, while the dark side stays superficial and stereotypical in most works and the narrative focus is on establishing the protagonists, Weber doesn´t just produce amazingly detailed, perfectly planned and plotted space battles, but a social and ideological backbone too, adding an extra, deeper layer besides Honor and the plot action.I don´t know how far he will still go and develop these ideas and style in the many parts of the series I haven´t read, it´s so enormous that I am not sure about continuing reading it, but just thinking about which philosophical and ethical implications might lie there hidden in the endless space of the Honorverse make me want to do it.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77735.The_Honor_of_the_Queen

Clarke;1999;1990;272;3.58;26592;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure'];The mysteries of the monoliths are revealed in this inspired conclusion to the Hugo Award–winning Space Odyssey series—“there are marvels aplenty” (The New York Times). On an ill-fated mission to Jupiter in 2001, the mutinous supercomputer HAL sent crewmembers David Bowman and Frank Poole into the frozen void of space. Bowman’s strange transformation into a Star Child is traced through the novels 2010 and 2061. But now, a thousand years after his death, Frank Poole is brought back to life—and thrust into a world far more technically advanced than the one he left behind. Poole discovers a world of human minds interfacing directly with computers, genetically engineered dinosaur servants, and massive space elevators built around the equator. He also discovers an impending threat to humanity lurking within the enigmatic monoliths. To fight it, Poole must join forces with Bowman and HAL, now fused into one corporeal consciousness—and the only being with the power to thwart the monoliths’ mysterious creators. “3001 is not just a page-turner, plugged in to the great icons of HAL and the monoliths, but a book of wisdom too, pithy and provocative.” —New Scientist;"3001: The Final Odyssey (Space Odyssey #4), Arthur C. Clarke3001: The Final Odyssey is a 1997 science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke. It is the fourth and final book in Clarke's Space Odyssey series.3001 follows the adventures of Frank Poole, the astronaut killed by the HAL 9000 computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey. One millennium later, Poole's freeze-dried body is discovered in the Kuiper belt by a comet-collecting space tug named the Goliath, and revived. Poole is taken home to learn about the Earth in the year 3001. Some of its notable features include the BrainCap, a brain–computer interface technology; genetically engineered dinosaur servants; and four gigantic space elevators located evenly around the Equator. Humans have also colonized the Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto. TMA-1, the black monolith found on the Moon in 1999, has been brought to Earth in 2006 and installed in front of the United Nations Building in New York City. It is determined that following the events of 2010: Odyssey Two and 2061: Odyssey Three, the Jovian monolith had sent a report to its superior monolith 450 light years away, and is expected to receive its orders toward humanity after the nine-century round-trip. Presumably, the monolith was empowered to obliterate the nascent biosphere of Jupiter, but needed a higher authority's approval to do the same with the technological civilization on Earth. There is considerable worry that the judgment, based on the monolith's observations of humanity up to 2061, will be negative, and the human race thus destroyed as the Jovian bio-forms discovered by David Bowman were wiped out (while making Jupiter a small sun to assist intelligence on Europa). Frank conscripts Bowman and HAL, who have now become a single entity—Halman—residing in the monolith's computational matrix, to infect the monolith with a computer virus. The monolith does receive orders to exterminate humanity, and starts a duplication cascade, whereupon millions of monoliths form two screens to prevent Solar light and heat from reaching Earth and its colonies. Due to Halman having already infected the first monolith, all the monoliths disintegrate. Halman uploads itself into a petabyte-capacity holographic 3D storage medium and thus survives the disintegration of the monoliths, but is infected with the virus and is subsequently sealed by scientists in the Pico Vault. At the close of the story, Poole and other humans land on Europa to start peaceful relations with the primitive native Europeans. A statement is made that the monolith's makers will not determine humanity's fate until ""The Last Days"".تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و یکم ماه نوامبر سال 2012میلادیعنوان: سه هزار و یک 3001؛ - آخرین اودیسه؛ نویسنده: آرتور سی کلارک؛ مترجم: پیمان اسماعیلیان خامنه؛ تهران، نقطه، سال1377؛ در288ص؛ شابک9644740394؛ چاپ دیگر سال1382؛ در308ص؛ شابک9645548063؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده20مبخش چهارم، و پایانی سری «اودیسه»ی فضایی، است؛ «آخرین اودیسه»؛ تصویری از هزار سال آینده است؛ دورانی که در آن، نوع بشر به صورتی ناباورانه، به رغم رخدادهای مرگزا، همچنان به زندگی خویش، ادامه میدهد؛ «آرتور سی کلارک» در «ادیسه سه هزار و یک» گسترده ترین و پیروزمندانه ترین نمونه های علمی تخیلی زمان را، به انتهایی شکوهمندانه، و فراموش نکردنی، میرسانند؛ «آرتور سی کلارک» در سالهایی که در حال نگارشگری بودند، چندین کتاب داستان، و ناداستان، و بیش از صد داستان کوتاه، و صدها مقاله نگاشتند؛ از نامدارترین داستانهای علمی تخیلی ایشان، میشود به: «پایان کودکی» و «دیدار با راما»، و «زمین امپراتوری»، و «دو هزار و یک اودیسه فضائی» اشاره نمود؛ «کلارک» که هم اکنون از ایشان، به عنوان پیامبر دانش، یاد میشود، در رمانهای علمی تخیلی خود، چندین مورد، از مجموعه های اختراع شده ی تکنولوژیک امروزین بشر را، که صورت واقعیت بخود گرفته اند، پیش بینی کرده بودندداستان، که از پنج بخش تشکیل شده، ماجراجوهایی «فرانک پول» را، دنبال میکند، فضانوردی که، بوسیله ابررایانه در کتاب «ادیسه 2001 (جلد اول سری ادیسه)» کشته شده است؛ یک هزار سال بعد، بدن خشک و منجمد شده ی «فرانک»، در کمربند «کوپیر»، بوسیله ی یک یدک کش فضایی جمع کننده ستاره های دنباله دار، به اسم «گولیاث» کشف، و دوباره زنده میشود؛ «فرانک پول» به خانه برده میشود، و در مورد وضعیت زمین، در سال3001، میآموزد، و …؛ «آرتور سی کلارک» در «ادیسه 3001»، بزرگترین و موفقترین سری «علمی-تخیلی» دوران را، به پایانی باشکوه، و فراموش نشدنی میرسانند؛ ایشان هوشمندانه، به هزار سال آینده، پرش میکنند، تا حقیقتی را، که ما اکنون درک میکنیم، آشکار سازند؛ «ادیسه 3001»، یک شاهکار حماسی آمیخته با واقعیت علمیِ خیره کننده، خلاق، و بنیانمند است، که تنها «آرتور سی کلارک» میتوانستند آنرا برای امروزیان و آیندگان بسرایندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/11/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 08/09/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63432.3001

Chevette Washington is a bicycle messenger turned pickpocket who impulsively snatches a pair of innocent-looking sunglasses. But these are no ordinary shades. What you can see through these high-tech specs can make you rich--or get you killed. Now Berry and Chevette are on the run, zeroing in on the digitalized heart of DatAmerica, where pure information is the greatest high. And a mind can be a terrible thing to crash...;William Gibson begins his Bridge trilogy with this 1993 publication that was nominated for both the Hugo and the Locus awards.In the air of great protagonist names won hands down by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 cyberpunkapalooza Snow Crash with Hiro Protagonist, Gibson introduces us to Chevette Washington, a messenger living on the Bay Bridge between San Francisco and Oakland who gets caught up in corporate espionage surrounding some stolen glasses.But these are not just any glasses, they produce virtual light, enabling the viewer to see more than reality, and this is not just the Bay Bridge, this is Gibson’s world building after devastating earthquakes and after tumultuous socioeconomic and political upheavals.Taking off from his archetypal Sprawl series, Gibson gives us another foray into a near future cyberpunk landscape that mesmerizes as it entertains. While this lacks the fringe element edgy cool of Neuromancer, this is told more straightforward and has some early indications of the kind of writing Gibson would do with his Blue Ant series. SF readers who could not buy into the Sprawl books may find this one more approachable.Lots of fun and highly recommended.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22326.Virtual_Light

The Garden of Rama;Arthur C. Clarke;1991;1990;593;3.79;25579;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy', 'Space', 'Aliens'];In the year 2130 a mysterious spaceship, Rama, arrived in the solar system. It was huge - big enough to contain a city and a sea - and empty, apparently abandoned. By the time Rama departed for its next, unknown, destination many wonders had been uncovered, but few mysteries solved. Only one thing was clear: everything the enigmatic builders of Rama did, they did in threes.Eighty years later the second alien craft arrived in the solar system. This time, Earth had been waiting. But all the years of preparation were not enough to unlock the Raman enigma.Now Rama II is on its way out of the solar system. Aboard it are three humans, two men and a woman, left behind when the expedition departed. Ahead of them lies the unknown, a voyage no human has ever experienced. And at the end of it - and who could tell how many years away that might be? - may lie the truth about Rama...;"There's a scene towards the end of the sixth Harry Potter book where Harry and Dumbledore find a small basin of water with a much-needed magical item at the bottom of it. The water is cursed, though, and they can't simply reach in and grab the item, nor scoop out the water; the water has to be drunk in its totality before the item can be attained. And you just know that water's going to taste bad. Think the purified essence of a thousand Domino's pizzas and then multiply that by three. Yes, that bad. Anyway, Dumbledore realises what has to be done and makes Harry promise to keep feeding him the water, glass by painful glass, and not to stop no matter what happens. Well sure enough it gets unpleasant, immediately they start Dumbledore starts begging Harry to stop, weeping and ranting; Harry meanwhile pleads, cajoles, and lies to his headmaster in order to get him to drink one more glass, one more glass, one more glass. Reading The Garden of Rama is pretty much like that: I'd promised myself I was going to finish the Rama series and so had to get through this book, and so I persevered through it all, shovelling page after page of toxic drivel down my throat no matter how bad it got.I'm afraid this review isn't going to have much structure or narrative flow. There were too many things wrong with the book to make this anything more than a long list of free flowing criticisms. Besides, the book didn't bother having any structure or narrative flow so feel free to pretend that my review itself is some kind of meta-criticism if you like.Where to start? Well, the title makes no sense for one. In Rendezvous with Rama the main characters rendezvoused with a spacecraft dubbed Rama. In Rama II an identical looking spacecraft, dubbed Rama II, came to the solar system to be investigated. And in Rama Revealed I assume the secrets of the whole Rama thing will be, well, revealed (although see below). So then, this book must be about some great big vegetable patch in the spacecraft, right? Alas not. A settlement built within the ship is christened New Eden, and they have plants and stuff there, but that's pretty much the only relation to any garden in the book. Maybe this first criticism is overly pedantic, but it seems the choice of title here was either overly mundane or meaningless.Next on my gripe list is the acknowledgements section (yes, we haven't made it to page one yet). Gentry Lee thanks his wife for ""conversations about the nature of the female"" since the book is primarily told from Nicole Wakefield's perspective. Indeed the first part of the book is told as excerpts from her journal. So does Gentry Lee manage to transcend sex differences in this journal section? Do his wife's suggestions seamlessly meld into a convincing catalogue of thoughts from a woman trapped in an alien environment and getting pregnant left, right, and centre? No. No, no, and no. Instead we get utterly bog-standard first person prose, except every ten pages or so there will be a cringe inducing paragraph along the lines of ""So my husband didn't put the toilet seat down today. What is it with men and not doing that? Huh? As a woman it really gets my goat. You know what I'm talking about ladies, oh yes."" I've no doubt Mrs Lee gave her husband numerous insights into ""the nature of the female"" but he hasn't used them to make a believable character, he's just shoehorned a few of these bad stand-up routines into the main text.And while we're talking about the believability of our esteemed protagonist Nicole, let me ask you a question, dear reader. If you had to start the human civilisation again from scratch, how many people do you think you'd need to ensure enough genetic diversity to make the new civilisation tenable? I seem to recall a figure mentioned in The Matrix Reloaded for the number of humans needed to rebuild Zion is twenty three. Stephen Baxter makes this a big plot point at the end of Ark and agonises that forty six people with maximal genetic variation might just be okay. A quick straw poll amongst my friends with backgrounds in the biological sciences reckoned that quite a bit more than that would be needed. There's evidence that the human population fell to less than 15 000 once, and that maybe 500-1000 humans could breed their way away from extinction. So, with all that in mind, how many people does Dr Nicole des Jardins Wakefield, hero of Garden of Rama, think are necessary to breed their way out of trouble? Fifteen thousand, like the actual human population after the Toba eruption? Maybe one thousand, which some research suggests is a safe minimum? Perhaps only one hundred and sixty as determined by American anthropologist John Moore? Or only one hundred, as suggested by my biology friends after three glasses of wine and two minutes to think about the problem? Maybe Baxter was right with forty six, or the Wachowski brothers with twenty three? Well, Dr Nicole, what's your answer? Two.I'm sorry, what? There are three adults on Rama at the start of the book — two men and one woman. Nicole and her husband Richard have two daughters at which point Nicole starts wondering about how her daughters are going to continue the species. Clearly they need a man, preferably one each. So, she decides, she needs to pop out a couple of sons. Luckily, though, ""one of [her] major areas of specialty during [her] medical training was genetics, especially hereditary defects."" Phew! Looks like she'll realise the futility of all this and stop dooming all these kids to a lonely future in space. But no! There's more. At this point of the book Nicole is 41 years old and worries how many more babies she can have. She decides she has to have a son and preferably with Michael, the other guy on Rama with her. So then the next generation will consist of two girls and a guy, all of them either half- or full-siblings. And obviously that's a genetically viable group if ever I saw one. To be fair, Nicole doesn't just want kids with Michael to get some more genetic diversity, that'd be silly, she also picks him because both of her husband's kids are girls, while two out of the three kids that Michael has had back on Earth were boys, so having a son would be pretty much guaranteed with Mike but nigh on impossible with Dick. And here was me thinking it was fifty/fifty with both of them.So Nicole tells her (emotionally insecure and already quite jealous) husband she wants to get it on with Michael for scientific purposes, i.e. so their daughters will have a half-brother to shag later in life. And then she's surprised when he gets upset. Aggh! Stop, Harry, I can't take anymore! Later, after having had two sons with Michael, Richard shows up and she has a third daughter with him. Her main concern? That she's already paired up in her mind her two daughters and two sons, so daughter number three doesn't have a brother to make babies with. Aggh! No more, Harry! Please! The folly of the whole thing is only pointed out to her later by her thirteen year old daughter, who decides to marry seventy-two year old Uncle Michael, because marrying her half-brothers would be incest. Aggh! Enough, enough! And on a tangentially related note, Michael's two sons with Nicole sometimes refer to him as dad and sometimes as Uncle Michael, and similarly they sometimes call Richard dad and sometimes Uncle Richard. Why?Part two of the book reveals the purpose of Rama, how it was made, and so on. Most of the big questions are answered, which leaves one major question: what exactly is left to be revealed in Rama Revealed? We don't yet know who the over-arching authority is behind the whole thing, but it's some alien or another and frankly I don't think ""It turns out Rama was built by Zylorgs from planet Herpes"" is particularly fulfilling. On the subject of Rama's mission, it seems fundamentally flawed. It's supposed to catalogue the spacefaring species of the galaxy by flying through star systems, luring these species aboard, and then taking them back to The Node. From there Rama is refitted with biomes to support larger numbers of these species and messages are sent to each of these species' planets to the effect of ""We're coming back, prepare a few thousand of your species to come and live on Rama for an unspecified length of time. Then the whole thing flies back around the galaxy, picking up these species for observation. Frankly this sounds like a rubbish way for an ultra advanced society to study other species, as proved by the fact that Rama only ""captured"" its three humans by a huge fluke.Rama's mission is only slightly less believable than Earth's reaction to it. The human race of the original Rendezvous with Rama has spread across the solar system and, excitable Mercurians aside, the biggest problem it seems to face is an overabundance of petty bureaucracy. Gentry Lee ruthlessly deconstructs this world in Rama II, with a huge economic slump occurring just after the first novel's events that sets Earth back a century or so and obliterates its space programme. By the time Rama II begins, seventy years after its predecessor, the slump has lifted enough for a mediocre space programme to exist, but the military still decide to destroy Rama when it comes near Earth. Their missiles are ruthlessly efficient at tracking the spacecraft as they try (and fail) to obliterate it, but in this book it's claimed that Earth had believed the craft was destroyed. Apparently they fired their nuclear missiles at it and then everyone started staring at the ground saying ""Yup, I'm so sure we destroyed that thing I'm not even going to look up and check.""So when Earth is informed in the 2240s, forty years after Rama II, that they need to send two thousand individuals to Rama, do they rejoice at the chance to redeem themselves, to fix past mistakes, to send their best and brightest to discover the secrets of the Universe? No, the shady council that rules the world decides it's all a hoax perpetrated by those pesky Chinese, so they send their best and brightest and a whole ship full of rapists and murderers to Mars. If there happens to be a honking great spacecraft in the vicinity of Mars then they'll board that, if not they'll start a new Martian colony. Of course they don't tell all these people going to Mars that they might end up in an alien spaceship until they're actually in the alien spaceship.Of these two thousand people it seems that about twelve are half-decent human beings, that's including Nicole, Richard, and some of their kids. Since the kids were in stasis for their entire teenage lives they all have to deal with being, essentially, a child in an adult's body. Gentry Lee obviously deals with this in a delicate and thought-provoking manner: Patrick is shy with girls, Eleanor is perfectly fine, and Katie becomes a nymphomaniac. Wow! Of these twelve normal people, half are unceremoniously killed in a scene near the end of the book, and the humans in the colony happily let a Japanese mob boss take over. No one seems bothered that there's little food, the weather system is broken, and a hundred other problems, because the mob boss starts a war with another biome in Rama. Such flagrant clichés can work if they're told well, alas that's not the case here.Despite the three hundred or so five star reviews here on Goodreads, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who struggled to find the resolve to finish this book. The editors apparently had the same problem. As the book goes on more and more typoes start appearing: spelling errors, punctuation where it doesn't belong, and so on. One of the few solaces I could take was that this book is trashy pop science fiction, not hard science fiction, so powering through its six hundred pages was not difficult, just unpleasant.With all that in mind, I'm now off to read Rama Revealed, hopeful in the knowledge that things surely can't get worse.

In return, I introduced her to this book in which Gibson predicts such a thing, twenty years ago. Then we checked out her other hot new thing,  the PBS Idea Channel and among other things, we watched Mike Rugnetta talk about the connections between Gibson, Hatsune Miku, Lana del Rey, pop culture, technology and art. And then I told her about a show that used to be on, Connections by James Burke, which did much the same, albeit with less about art and more about technological breakthroughs. My evening was so meta I can't stand it.Anyway, now that the book has become reality, I think it's time for a re-read.

The Short Victorious War;David Weber;1994;1990;384;4.18;23796;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Military Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space'];"The proles are revolting.The families who rule the People's Republic of Haven are in trouble. The treasury's empty, the Proles are restless, and civil war is imminent.But the ruling class knows what they need to keep in power; another short, victorious war to unite the people and fill the treasury once more. It's a card they've played often in the last half-century, always successfully, and all that stands in their way is the Star Kingdom of Manticore and its threadbare allies.Only this time the Peeps face something different. This time they're up against Captain Honor Harrington and a Royal Manticoran Navy that's prepared to give them a war that's far from short...and anything but victorious.";"I think I've made up my mind about the Honor Harrington books. They are solid three star books. That doesn't mean that they are bad or that I won't read more of them. Three star books are good. They are fun. They just aren't great - and that is OK. The Honor Harrington books are the book equivalent of big budget Hollywood action flicks. There are gargantuan space battles between the good guys and the bad guys. Think beam weapons, nuclear tipped missiles, and exploding space ships. The Short Victorious War delivers plenty of the stuff. And it is loads of fun. I enjoyed every minute of the action - especially the bluffs and counter-bluffs of the Manticore and Haven navies. Like big budget Hollywood action movies, the Honor Harrington books lack meaningful character development and a true spark of originality. The Short Victorious War reintroduces Harrington's nemesis, Pavel Young, and there is some confrontation between the two because Young is technically her superior. Unfortunately when Young and Harrington came into conflict it felt formulaic. I was expecting Young to crack under pressure. I expected Harrington to have to save the day despite his cowardice. There is also a budding romance between Harrington and Paul Something-or-other, but it felt less than authentic to me. (I won't even go into the part where Mike (Harrington's female XO) had to teach Harrington how to apply make up. Really?!)Even more aggravating is the author's shameless borrowing from history. To some extent this makes sense. The vast distances of space and the slow progression of interstellar combat as Weber envisions it is more akin to the age of sail than it is to the lightning strikes of modern navies (or even WWII navies). I can accept that. What I find really annoying is the shameless adaptation of the 1780-1800 period. ""Rob S. Pierre"" (a.k.a., Robespierre) as the leader of the People's Quorum against the Hereditary Legislaturalist families (a.k.a., nobility). The revolutionary ""Committee of Public Safety."" (Golly, the French Revolution had one of those too! Gee, what are the odds?) I fully expect that the next books will have a reign of terror and a resurgent Havenite navy along with a Napoleon-like figure. I expect more out of my authors. Borrow elements from the past to make a compelling and interesting world, but ""Rob S. Pierre?"" Really? Ugh!I have no doubt that I will read at least a couple more of these books at some point but I know what they are now. They are solid three star books. Fun. Good. But not great.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77736.The_Short_Victorious_War
The Prestige;Christopher Priest;1995;1990;404;3.92;23035;no;['Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Audiobook', 'Historical'];In 1878, two young stage magicians clash in the dark during the course of a fraudulent séance. From this moment on, their lives become webs of deceit and revelation as they vie to outwit and expose one another.Their rivalry will take them to the peaks of their careers, but with terrible consequences. In the course of pursuing each other's ruin, they will deploy all the deception their magicians' craft can command--the highest misdirection and the darkest science.Blood will be spilled, but it will not be enough. In the end, their legacy will pass on for generations...to descendants who must, for their sanity's sake, untangle the puzzle left to them.;"""My error, at first, was to assume that the sheer brilliance of the effect would be enough to dazzle my audiences. What I was neglecting was one of the oldest axioms of magic, that the miracle of the trick must be made clear by the presentation. Audiences are not easily misled, so the magician must provoke their interest, hold it, then confound every expectation by performing the apparently impossible."" - Christopher Priest, The PrestigeThe Prestige - Christopher Priest’s highly inventive, masterfully crafted tale written in the grand tradition of Victorian novels of mystery and suspense, specifically Wilkie Collins’ The Woman in White (use of multiple narrators) and Moonstone (epistolary novel). The language is so well tuned and exact, so vividly clear, many the time turning the pages I felt as if I was launched miraculously back into the streets, flats and performance halls of turn-of-the-century London. So compelling and thrilling, my response to the British author repeats esteemed critic Garry Indiana's words regarding the literary output of Georges Simenon, “I know how he does it, but I have no idea how he can do it.” Christopher Priest - what a marvelous weaver of fictional magic. And speaking of magic, please read on. True, the novel begins and ends at a country estate in modern-day England where journalist Andrew Westley and Lady Kate Angier, both young and single, take turns narrating as they sit together and move about in Kate’s family mansion, however this is but the frame – the bulk of the narrative consists of the respective diaries of two of their long dead ancestors, Alfred Borden and Rupert Angier, illustrious stage magicians who had been engaged in a bitter, vindictive rivalry protracted over many years, beginning in the late nineteenth century. The plot is simply too good and contains too many surprises for me to divulge any tantalizing secrets, thus I will shift my observations to a number of the novel’s underlying themes and philosophical enigmas. Illusion: Counterpoint to nimble skill and dexterity performing sleight of hand and misdirection, concealment and manipulation on stage, Alfred Borden and Rupert Angier are also master illusionists as each pens his diary. Claiming the two magicians are less than reliable narrators is understatement as we are never entirely certain where the illusions start and where they stop, where reality begins and where it ends. Now you read it, now you don’t. And in case you might not catch the shift since it is so easy to miss, there is one short chapter of the novel where Christopher Priest deftly slides into telling the tale in objective third person – a crafty authorial variation on now you read it, now you don’t. Revenge: Ah, retaliation, vengeance, payback, reprisal - the juice of mountains of fiction and generous helpings of history. But, as both Alfred Borden and Rupert Angier discover the hard way, the aftermath of vengeful words and actions are never nearly as clear-cut and confined as we might conceive. In many cases, the person extracting revenge is completely oblivious to the full range of consequences, sometimes affecting men, women and children over a number of generations. Secrecy: An enormous part of a stage magician’s art is secrecy - how the trick is performed. Alfred Borden and Rupert Angier extend their secrecy to nearly all aspects of their personal and professional lives. Of course, the more secrets one has, more the possibility of being discovered. But while a secret remains a secret, the magician maintains a power, an advantage over his audience if stage magic; over his family and associates if his secret pertains to his personal life. The ultimate disgrace for a stage magician – having the secret of his trick revealed publicly during a performance. Of course, this is exactly the practice of both Alfred Borden and Rupert Angier. 	 Twins: Just think of the power a magician would possess if he had an identical twin he kept secret. All the jaw dropping feats of stage magic he could perform – I’m over here on this side of the stage, presto, in an instant, I’m over there on that side of the stage. Such secrecy and magic might qualify as the ultimate illusion. One could stake a career on such an astounding trick. However, two people going through life pretending they are one and the same person will undoubtedly alter a sense of one’s individual identity, one of the prime hallmarks of what it means to be human. Or, will it? Can a master of illusion pull it off successfully? Many the author captivated by the idea and possibilities of twins, my personal favorite: Shakespeare’s The Comedy of Errors featuring not one but two sets of twins. Identity of the Self: Robert Nozick has a thought experiment where, after an accident, half of one person’s brain (along with memory) is transferred to a second person’s body. Both Tim, the giver, and Tom, the receiver, live after the operation and both Tim and Tom claim to be Tim. Are they both right? The next day Tim dies and Tom is now the only person claiming to be Tim. Does Tom (now Tim) assume the old Tim’s rights and obligations, including the right to live with Tim’s wife and kids? The ancient world knew such a dilemma of identity with the ship of Theseus: the planks and other parts of the ship are all replaced over time. After the last old plank is removed and replaced, is it the same ship or a different ship? What if less than half of the ship is replaced? What if more than half is replaced? The variations are endless. The Prestige hurls a few crazy twists into the mix. Electricity: The end of the nineteenth century, the heyday as stage performers for the novel’s two magicians, was also the heyday for inventors such as Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. In 1879 electric lights were first used for public street lighting. The possibilities and power of electricity captured the public’s imagination. And if a performer could include the sizzling, popping currents of this newly found power into their act– what a show! Jolt of the Weird: Although a Victorian thriller in the tradition of Wilkie Collins, please keep in mind Christopher Priest has been strongly influenced by H. G. Wells. Similar to his science fiction novel Inverted World where events move along at a measured pace until the jolt of the weird, The Prestige has its own weird jolt which leads to a series of even weirder jolts. One of the most fascinating and astonishing last parts of any novel you will ever read. If you are stirred to consider The Prestige, I’m accomplished my own bit of magic as a reviewer.*Special thanks to Wastrel and Kevin for suggesting I make The Prestige my next Christopher Priest novel. **There is a absolutely first rate audio book available where Simon Vance reads The Prestige. “The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you wont find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled.”― Christopher Priest, The Prestige";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239239.The_Prestige

Even the fact that Miles is third in line to the throne and personally owns a major chunk of his home planet would not tempt any normal person to change places with him.When assassins came to rid the world of his father, his mother, pregnant with Miles, was in the line of fire, and Miles was but an egg for the omelet in an all too literal sense. Thanks to heroic medical intervention, Miles survived his near fatal brush with war gas-as a pain-filled dwarf with bones as weak and brittle as some malign composite of chalk and glass. Miles is often mistaken for a mutant by his mutant loathing countrymen.But there is one who does envy him, who wants to be him: his brother, his cloned stranger formed from tissue stolen from Miles when he was a child. For Mark Vorkosigan was created and raised up for only one purpose: to become Miles, to murder and replace him. In Brothers in Arms that conspiracy was routed and Mark made more or less compliant to his new Miles-less fate. But in the intervening years Mark has learned that without Miles he is . . . nothing.

""...“Since no one is perfect, it follows that all great deeds have been accomplished out of imperfection. Yet they were accomplished, somehow, all the same.”...""
I wrote this passionate and thoughtful review, and GR ate it, forever lost in the gut of the internet... I am quite frustrated about that, but I still wanted to say that this book, although in no way perfect, was very emotional and it tugged on all of my heart-strings... There were moments when I laughed, I cried, I was happy and disappointed, but overall, I was drawn to and emerged in the tale of woe and ultimate success in the lives of our young Vorkosigans! 
""...“It’s important that someone celebrate our existence,"" she objected amiably. ""People are the only mirror we have to see ourselves in. The domain of all meaning. All virtue, all evil, are contained only in people. There is none in the universe at large. Solitary confinement is a punishment in every human culture.”...""
I really do not want to write anything much about the plot, since it is one of those that you really do not want spoiled for you, but the multilayered story began with a surprise trip to Jackson Hall, may their name be forgotten by History and Santa leave only coal in their stalkings, then a botched military operation, then time was spend on Barrayar and so on and on... We got to get to know Mark much better, enough for him to make us pity him, sympathies with him, then hate him, then try to understand him, then give him a chance, then suffer for him and finally settle at a state of OK, he is Mark and he will never be like Miles, but he is a very interesting and very insane dude whom we can live with and be interested to see more of... We also got to see Miles in a bit of a different light, and not to be left behind, he also did things I was very unhappy with him about, but again, at the end of the day, this is Miles and he is amazing just as nuts, impulsive, charming and infuriating as always, just the way we have come to love and care for him as much as we do... But my personal treat was the small cameo by wolf-girl who always steals the moment with her unending earnestness and gentle soul, as well as the more page time by Cordelia!!!! I loooooove this woman! She is what I want to be when I grow up, which might be already tomorrow, since I am quite grown already. She is smart, gentle, logical, loving, strong and ferocious, Cordelia is a force of nature and I would love to be in the vicinity of her awesomeness, but since that is impossible, getting as much of her on page is what I consider a treat from the author specially for me:):):) She is the reason for Miles and the men in her life to be as they are, the better for knowing and loving her, and I love that the author lets us see this in a very unobtrusive, gentle way. The only issues I had were concerning Miles, Quinn and Bell, and I wish we could have gotten a better outcome there, but I trust the author to lead us in the world of her creation and will follow wherever she takes us. 
""...“I do think, half of what we call madness is just some poor slob dealing with pain by a strategy that annoys the people around him.”...""
This book was not perfect, it was very, very painful to read at times and I cried like a baby on couple of occasions... But despite all of that, this is a book I know I will remember for a long, long time, because it did not only leave its mark in my brain, but in my soul as well... It is also the first one in the series I do not believe is for everyone, since there are bad things happening and some might have issues with them. I did too, but not in a way to be repelled by the book. I was repelled by the actions of the characters, but they had their role, their purpose. Nothing was there just for gratuitously or for the shock value. As always, the author made us think by putting the characters in extraordinary circumstances and made us think about how we might have handled them in their place... I am only glad that I am not anywhere close to Jackson Hall, may it disintegrate to its molecular components!!!!

Forever Peace;Joe Haldeman;1997;1990;351;3.75;21783;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Hugo Awards', 'War', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Military Fiction', 'Audiobook'];2043 A.D.: The Ngumi War rages. A burned-out soldier and his scientist lover discover a secret that could put the universe back to square one. And it is not terrifying. It is tempting...;"Welcome to the future...where the final war is being waged

....against war itself. There is such a bounty of wonderful, insightful and important ideas stuffed into this novel that I find myself seriously bummed that weak storytelling and plodding central plot flow marred my enjoyment enough to keep me from awarding this a 4th star. Still, from a component standpoint, this is a collection of gems. THE POLITICS:The Haves:The Alliance, led by the U.S., but including most of what we would consider the elite industrialized nations (e.g., U.K., Japan, France, Germany, Russia) is engaged in a bloody, relentless guerilla/terrorist/revolutionary war against the Ngumi (see Have Nots below). The Alliance's primary weapon is the soldierboy:


 All ten people in Julian Class’s platoon had the same basic weapon-- the soldierboy, or Remote Infantry Combat Unit: a huge suit of armor with a ghost in it. For all the weight of its armor, more than half of the RICU’s mass was ammunition. It could fire accurate sniper rounds to the horizon, two ounces of depleted uranium, or at close range it could hose a stream of supersonic flechettes. It had high explosive and incendiary rockets with eyes , a fully automatic grenade launcher, and a high-powered laser. Special units could be fitted with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, but those were only used for reprisal in kind. 
 FYI, the photo above is the frontispiece from my Easton Press copy of the novel so I thought it was the best representation of the RICU. However, before I found that I had already set aside the following pic and so I will go ahead and share rather than waste it because I thought it was pretty cool. 

Each soldierboy unit is controlled from 1000s of miles away by an engineer who is ""jacked-in"" to the machine via an advanced neurological link that can not be duplicated or hacked. War as VR video game...*shudder*...is it just me or do you just sense that something like this is right around the corner and it’s only a matter of time.  While jacked, all ten humans in the platoon share each others consciousness, memories and thoughts and Haldeman does a very good job of addressing the issues of gender, sexuality and intimacy that result from such a merging of male and female identities. Another unusual aspect that Haldeman brilliantly employs is that most of the humans “jacked” into the soldierboys are pacifists by nature. They are professors, doctors and scholars who hate what they are required to do and usually attempt to limit loss of life to the enemy...though they still kill boat loads the size of the titanic. The psychological effect of the war on these people is a central part of the story. The Have NotsThe other side of the conflict are the Ngumi: a loose confederation of 54 rebel groups comprised of (1) the majority populations of most of the underdeveloped nations, (2) strong minority factions within Alliance member states and (3) untethered revolutionaries fighting the resource distribution disparity. Not having the resources or the technology (see Societal description below), the Ngumi can't muster anywhere near the firepower of the Alliance. They are more like:

They are severely outgunned but highly motivated to the “cause.” This “cause” has nothing to do with ideology, religion or cultural differences, but rather is centered around wealth and the access to resources (specifically, the nano forges discussed below). Again...is it just me or is a version of a have vs haven’t conflict also slouching towards Bethlehem the near future to be born.  While not a central aspect of the conflict, Haldeman does introduce significant racial elements into the plot which I thought he handled well. The majority of the Alliance members are white, the majority of the Ngumi are not. Ironically, the main character, Julian, is African-American and confronts issues of discrimination and prejudice during the course of the novel. THE SOCIETY:The great divide between the Alliance and Ngumi stems from the Alliance’s possession of nano forges.These devices can manufacture just about anything with sand, water and trace chemicals (the exception to this being certain items like nuclear weapons which will still require components like uranium to be included). The nano forges have changed the Alliance into a proto post-scarcity society and the government has been reformed as a socialist state in which people are provided the necessities of life in exchange for 3 years military service. The nano forges allow for construction of all of the soldierboys needed to conduct the war and the only restraint on the numbers in the field are that only a small percentage of the population can successfully undergo the “jacking” procedure. The rest of the population gets to live vicariously through the soliders by turning on CNN and watching 24/7 coverage of laser guided bomb slamming video game-like into far away targets renting edited versions of the mental recordings made by soldierboys in the field. In addition to the central ""war story"" thread, the book also has another major plot thread involving a scientific experiment being taken on an orbital platform orbiting Jupiter that is designed to provide definitive answers to what happened at the “Big Bang”...if it doesn’t destroy the universe in the process. This story-line intersects with the main plot in a kind of Childhood’s End moment that sets the stage for where humanity goes next as a species. THE ALLEGORIES:If you have clued into it yet, let me say plainly that this novel is absolutely dripping with allegories and eerie parallels to our world. First, the Iraq War with its video game-like conflict shown on TV 24/7 and vicariously experienced (and enjoyed) by civilians safe at home. Second, 9/11 and the War on Terror in which a shocking terrorist attack (claimed by the other side to be the work of the Alliance itself) is used as the justification for a global war against the loose-never-entirely-defined enemy that is everywhere. Given that this book was written in 1997, the prescience of Haldeman’s foreshadowing is scary to the point of AHHHHHHHHHH!!!MY THOUGHTS:This story, while not a sequel to Haldeman’s classic The Forever War, is part of what Haldeman refers to as a triptych (the third piece being 1968 Co which I have not read yet). As Haldeman so eloquently puts it, the three novels define 
a surface as, in mathematics, three points define a surface. It’s a philisophical surface that everyone of our age has been concerned with all our intellectual lives: the problems of war and pacifism...Why has any of this happened?
.There are important matters being examined here and SF fans interested in these issues should check this out. There is much to make your brain swoon. The world that Haldeman envisions is fascinating. It’s both hopeful and yet extremely troubling. The obvious parallels to current events adds an even greater degree of hair-raising to the narrative. His ability to idea generate in impressive. His story-telling, in this instance, not so impressive. I am a fan of Haldeman and generally enjoy his plot deliveries. However, in this case, I found it merely okay and was periodically disengaged from the story by bouts of boredom with the scene choices or impatience with the pacing between events. It wasn’t horrible, but it was weaker than I would have liked and it decreased my enjoyment of a story that had oodles going for it. The worst flaw in my opinion was the poor characterization. While not caricatures, the players were too wooden and lifeless for me to engage with to any significant degree. This will usually kill a story for me as it makes scenes appear to go on for much longer than they actually do. When you don’t care what happens to person A, than person A talking about a bad thing happening doesn’t exactly keep you riveted to the page. This lack of character connection is even more troubling in this story because this novel is, at its core, a psychological examination of the human species and its propensity for aggression. Much of what occurs is reactive to the stresses placed on the soldiers by the requirement of their job. The reader needs to be able to connect with them and feel their internal struggle. Sadly, I didn’t. I understood it intellectually but was never vested in the personal well-being of the protagonists. As you might guess, this led to a less than enthusiastic reading experience . Despite all of the books story-telling flaws, this is a book I recommend to SF fans and fans of military fiction. There is so much win in the world-building and the ideas peppering the story that it makes the lack of a page-turning plot worth the trouble. Creative...original...important...a bit of a slog. 3 out of 4 isn’t too bad. 3.5 stars.

If you want the ending of Emilio's story, this might be worth a read (although be prepare for more sadness!).;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16948.Children_of_God
Field of Dishonor;David Weber;1994;1990;416;4.22;21522;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Military Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space'];"HONOR BETRAYEDThe People's Republic of Haven's sneak attack on the Kingdom of Manticore has failed. The Peeps are in disarray, their leaders fighting for power in bloody revolution, and the Royal Manticoran Navy stands victorious.But Manticore has domestic problems of its own, and success can be more treacherous than defeat for Honor Harrington. Now, trapped at the core of a political crisis she never sought, betrayed by an old and vicious enemy she'd thought vanquished forever, she stands alone.She must fight for justice on a battlefield she never trained for in a private war that offers just two choices: death . . . or a ''victory'' that can end only in dishonor and the loss of all she loves.About David Weber and the Honor Harrington series: “. . .everything you could want in a heroine….

Field of Dishonor
Flag in Exile Honor Among EnemiesIn Enemy Hands Echoes of Honor Ashes of Victory War of Honor The Shadow of Saganami At All Costs Storm from the Shadows Mission of Honor A Rising Thunder Shadow of Freedom";After reading this book I realized that The Short Victorious War was just a prelude to what Weber wanted to do here. While Harrington was barely a player in that novel, she is the center of this one. And while all the other novels of this series have indulged in a large amount of militaristic (as well as political) strategy , this focuses on the character development of Honor Harrington herself more than any other portion of the series I have read yet.It is a story of loss and dealing with that loss. Of controlling hatred and seeking justice instead of revenge. The previous books have displayed Harrington's military and tactical prowess, her innate ability to command and lead, but this book really reveals the cold killer that she can unleash from within as well.But don't let that deter you from reading it. It is really wonderfully written, with a rather relentless pace. Though the politics from the previous novels are still running in the background they take a backseat to the primary story. The war with Haven still looms, but it has yet to have been realized at this point.The book starts with the total disgracing of Pavel Young, who is virtually Honor's sworn enemy. He blames her for all his misfortune and disgrace and is almost insane with his need to destroy her. [slight SPOILER ahead...] He hires a professional dueler to instigate a duel with Paul Tankersley to kill him - because Pavel knows that will hurt Harrington. He also has hired the dueler to instigate a duel with Honor and kill her as well - but they all underestimate her. All Young really manages to do is awake her full wrath and bring it upon himselfI highly recommend this book, especially to those who love and enjoy any of the other Harrington novels. I would recommend reading The Short Victorious War, as it leads directly into this one. It actually sets up several plot lines which are not concluded until this novel.As a standalone science fiction novel it doesn't quite meet the standard of the genre - mainly that if you remove the science or technology there would be no story. No, I think this story could have been told in a historical narrative as well - but it would lack Harrington, and that makes all the difference in my mind. Weber has woven quite a driving tale full of intriguing characters once again, and it is definitely well worth the read.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/504369.Field_of_Dishonor
Specter of the Past;Timothy Zahn;1997;1990;386;4.02;21191;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];Hugo Award-winning author Timothy Zahn makes his triumphant return to the Star Wars(r) universe in this first of an epic new two-volume series in which the New Republic must face its most dangerous enemy yet--a dead Imperial warlord.The Empire stands at the brink of total collapse. But they have saved their most heinous plan for last. First a plot is hatched that could destroy the New Republic in a bloodbath of genocide and civil war. Then comes the shocking news that Grand Admiral Thrawn--the most cunning and ruthless warlord in history--has apparently returned from the dead to lead the Empire to a long-prophesied victory. Facing incredible odds, Han and Leia begin a desperate race against time to prevent the New Republic from unraveling in the face of two inexplicable threats--one from within and one from without. Meanwhile, Luke teams up with Mara Jade, using the Force to track down a mysterious pirate ship with a crew of clones. Yet, perhaps most dangerous of all, are those who lurk in the shadows, orchestrating a dark plan that will turn the New Republic and the Empire into their playthings.;Thank God for Timothy Zahn.I don’t say that lightly, either, or ironically, as in “Thank God for burritos” or “Thank God for Internet porn”. It’s not a simple throw-away praise to the heavens. It’s heartfelt. And this from someone who doesn’t necessarily believe in the heavens or God or all that stuff.I really mean it. Thank God for Timothy Zahn.Because I’m not going to lie: when I decided several weeks ago to read all of the Star Wars Expanded Universe novels (post-”Return of the Jedi”), I did not expect that it would become so, well, tasking.Not that the journey hasn’t been somewhat enjoyable. It’s been fun reading different authors’ interpretations and perspectives of the universe created in 1977 by George Lucas. He invented a vast playing field for some of the best science fiction and fantasy writers to run around in, and the results have been extraordinary.It has also taken an unforeseen toll on my mental state. I have, in some ways, become so immersed in the SWEU that I have begun having SWEU-inspired dreams. I walk around in SWEU-filled daymares, wishing that I could use the Force to make traffic move faster or a Jedi mind trick to convince my boss that I should go home three hours early. When dealing with annoying customers or co-workers, I wish that I could raise my hand and Force-strangle them with a memorable Darth Vader-like statement: “Your lack of faith disturbs me.” I have basically become intoxicated on “Star Wars”, and not in a good way.I also realize, however, that there are millions of fans out there who can relate to this feeling, and many of them, I’m sure, see absolutely nothing wrong with it.I feel like Morgan Spurlock did half-way through his one-month experiment to eat nothing but McDonald’s food in his movie “Supersize Me”. Like him, I am, at this point, fearing for my sanity and well-being, but I will carry on, knowing that there is an eventual light at the end of the tunnel. For me, it is simply 45 more books in the series. (Holy shit, did I read that right?..)Honestly, the last couple books in the series, while entertaining, were a wide range of mediocre to decent. Very few stood out for me as “above average” or even “excellent”. Kristine Kathryn Rusch’s “The New Rebellion” came damn close, and Roger MacBride Allen’s “Corellian Trilogy” had its moments, but I was beginning to feel the stirrings of something I never thought I’d feel while reading a Star Wars book: boredom.Which brings me to: Thank God for Timothy Zahn. I just finished reading (“devouring” is more appropriate) the first book in his “Hand of Thrawn” duology, “Specter of the Past”. (A duology, in case you didn’t know, is a two-book series, the way a three-book series is a trilogy. I know you probably knew this, smartypants, but I didn’t when I first picked the book up, and I love discovering new words.)This book carries on some of the narrative threads started in Zahn’s legendary “Thrawn” trilogy, published in 1991, an excellent series that had the distinction of jump-starting the entire Expanded Universe series.In this book, the villainous Admiral Thrawn, thought to have died in the third book, “The Last Command”, is rumored to have arisen from the dead and has plans to reunite the Empire, which is a shambles.Thrawn’s original second-in-command, Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, is a grizzled, old Imperial officer who has done his best to hold the remnants of the once-great Empire together. After a lifetime of war, however, Pellaeon has decided that the only solution to keeping the Empire alive in any form is through peace with the New Republic. There is almost unanimous---albeit reluctant---agreement among the other officers in his Imperial Fleet.One voice of dissent, however, comes from Moff Disra, who wants to continue the fighting and destroy the New Republic. Of course, he also has the lofty goal of becoming the new Emperor, eventually. In the meantime, he comes up with a pretty elaborate and clever scheme, along with the help of one of Emperor Palpatine’s elite Royal Guard, Grodin Tierce, and a con man named Flim.The scheme involves a plot to foment unrest and hatred between alien nations within the New Republic. Princess Leia Organa, the President of the NR, is overwhelmed with negotiations and settling disputes between the member nations of the NR. Things are getting worse. Pockets of violence have erupted, and there is the faint rumors of civil war.With the help of smuggler Talon Karrde and former Imperial assassin Mara Jade, the original “Star Wars” crew---Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, Chewie, C3-PO, and R2-D2---set out (in opposite directions, of course) to make things right. Along the way, Zahn introduces many new characters.To say that “Specter of the Past” is deftly-plotted, suspenseful, and fast-paced is, of course, a given with Zahn. It also helps that he writes with a butter-smooth prose style that fits perfectly with the genre and the Star Wars Expanded Universe. Zahn clearly knows “Star Wars”, and he also clearly knows the formulaic conventions of science fiction without his book seeming formulaic.Hands down, “Specter of the Past” is the best SWEU novel I have read thus far. And so far, book two,”Vision of the Future” is equally wonderful.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77787.Specter_of_the_Past

Miles and Cousin Ivan travel to Cetaganda to play the part of sprigs of nobility doing their diplomatic duty. But when the Empress of Cetaganda dies naturally, and her lifelong attendant dies unnaturally, Miles and Ivan finds themselves in the thick of it.;"this one hit a sweet spot that I didn't know I even had: incredibly beautiful, highly intelligent, aristocratic geneticists who prize elegance and subtlety, float around in their floating chairs while encased in pearly force fields, and never cut their hair! much like the protagonist Miles, I was immediately enchanted.unlike Miles, the reader is able to quickly discern that these remote and regal ladies actually control their empire. power lies not with the Emperor nor the warlike generals, and certainly not the various upper crust dandies who wander around creating scent-art; all bow to my newly-found sweet spot's authority. perhaps Miles was fooled by titles like ""Consort"" and ""Handmaiden"" - but still, it was a little surprising seeing that both Miles' mom and the love of his life are subtle, independent women who are completely in control. well I guess I can understand a little. Miles turns into a walking boner as soon as a ""Haut"" Lady (yes, that is what they are called, um) opens up her force bubble... and that state is not conducive to clear thinking.speaking of walking boners, Miles' cousin Ivan is very much a part of this novel and he is just as enjoyable as ever. dim, grouchy-sweet, unimaginative, loyal, lady-killin' Ivan, what's not to like. and speaking of what not to like, Miles actually refers to himself as a genius in this one. oh Miles. you and Kvothe, sweet Jesus, the egos on some of these kids. fortunately, Bujold is aware of Miles' flaws and they are happily skewered. she is also completely aware that a person's flaws are often intrinsically connected to their virtues; one can't exist without the other in Miles, and in so many others. ain't that the truth!the world-building was especially well-done in this one. not info-dump world-building, but rather slowly drawn-out Let's Figure Out This Mysterious Place Called Cetaganda type world-building. the empire of Cetaganda is a marvelous creation, layered and compelling and very carefully thought-out. brisk, fun, smart. entertaining!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76812.Cetaganda
The Neutronium Alchemist;Peter F.

Those who succumbed to it have acquired godlike powers, but now follow a far from divine gospel as they advance inexorably from world to world.On planets and asteroids, individuals battle for survival against the strange and brutal forces unleashed upon the universe. Governments teeter on the brink of anarchy, the Conferderation Navy is dangerously over-stretched, and a dark messiah prepares to invoke his own version of the final Night.In such desperate times the last thing the galaxy needs is a new and terrifyingly powerful weapon. Yet Dr Alkad Mzu is determined to retrieve the Alchemist - so she can complete her thirty-year vendetta to slay a star. Which means Joshua Calvert has to find Dr. Mzu and bring her back before the alchemist can be reactivated.But he's not alone in the chase, and there are people on both sides who have their own ideas about how to use the ultimate doomsday device.;So what are the secret ingredients and, even more important, the recipe Hamilton is using to create those amazing worlds? Ready to cook, let´s roll.Worldbuilding in a new, not too hard sci-fi, but still complex enough dimension and with extreme detail: I keep referring to Brandersons´ law of magic a lot nowadays and it could be called Hamiltons´ law instead too.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_an...From time to time, there might be the rare case of character exposition without something related to the world or preparing a setting or increasing suspense in the next chapter or novel, but as a rule, characters, world, and plot are one and the same, everything is always in interconnection with the other parts. It´s one of the reasons why King and Pratchett are so great too, because they made it their main goal to fuse absolutely everything together so that there is no way to escape the magic or horror world for just one moment, no boring yada yada, no descriptions that make no sense and don´t prepare the ground for the coming escalation.Fractions: Often, there are up to half a dozen of fractions in complex Sci-Fi, or at least 3 to 4, which leads to people avoiding the genre after such a subjective epic fail of having to kind of learn and remember too many constellations instead of having reading fun. But Hamilton finds a compromise between complexity and accessibility, no ultra-difficult to understand explanations of the happenings in the backgrounds, diplomatic interconnections, trade wars, everything smooth and always accelerating with exactly the balanced amount of opponents needed to tell a great story. It´s as cool as possible. Similarities to badass action movies may occur and the style of it compensates for the one or other coincidence or improbability. The extremely long fighting and description scenes are manifestations of what is one of Hamiltons´ greatest strengths, but makes him too time-consuming for some readers who don´t want to read a few thousand pages. Come on, what do you want to do instead, go outside the house or what, meet people and stuff, come on, don´t be ridiculous. He writes in detail, in very specific and wordy detail, and while this may be not so confusing in not so complex, interwoven, other genres, it could be difficult for readers of better manageable and not so long works. But it´s totally worth it once one is beamed into the universe. This wise, just joking, advice is added to all reviews of Hamiltons´series.One of the most fascinating aspects of Hamilton´s future vision is to see the technology and society developing in very detail over long periods of time, making a return to his universe something always stunning and inspiring. It also makes me wonder why he is the only author I know of who did this. One, who is new, lucky you, by the way, ought consider reading it in chronological order, although the series set closest to now, Salvation lost, is still unfinished, so better read before in the following order:Salvation year 2200Commonwealth year 2400The Night´s Dawn trilogy year 2700The Chronicle of the Fallers year 3400Void trilogy year 3600You can of course do as you wish, it´s just how I arrange my rereading to get the most out of it and slowly move further and further away from the boring present.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/479561.The_Neutronium_Alchemist

The campaign to liberate Mortonridge from the possessed degenerates into a horrendous land battle, the kind which hasn't been seen by humankind for six hundred years; then some of the protagonists escape in a very unexpected direction. Joshua Calvert and Syrinx fly their starships on a mission to find the Sleeping God - which an alien race believes holds the key to overthrowing the possessed.";Retrospectivality! What were the coolest elements of this amazing series Hamilton was able to reproduce, expand, prequel, sequel, write handbooks about,… that created the legend of the man space opera is irreversibly merged with forever. Peter, you are my hero!Immortality, other universes and dimensions, life extension, and the afterlife: Gaia, the tech, ships, medicine, fractions, everything in this universe has some elements of the most fundamental and elemental manifestation of life: avoiding and defeating death. Depending on in which epoch of what series one enters Hamiltons´ world creation, there are more primitive forms of life extension such as just adding a few hundred years, or already getting uploaded to a collective consciousness for a few thousand years until the last copies vanish, to the sophisticated versions of becoming immortal entities with technology of parallel universe quanta fantasy induced immortality. How the society and the protagonists react in the different stages of evolution is always of interest and has highest potential for endless plotting. Characters totally instrumentalized for the sake of the plot. Forget detailed and believable character descriptions, here it´s all about the ultimate fusion of world and protagonists, there will hardly be anything that doesn´t accelerate the telling engine. It´s quite the same as what I said about worldbuilding in another reviewhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_an...and this switching between some grains of characterization and backstory and full metal action in dialogues and happenings makes the telling dynamic, one is always waiting for a slower description scene, a cool argument, or an intergalactic space battle that may follow next.The aliens (in all of his series): They are so detailed, their evolution so stylish, that I could still endlessly blatter just about how the different antagonists evolved in Hamiltons´work, so avoid asking me about it for the sake of the conservation of your lifetime. Often, in sci-fi, the motivations and detailed descriptions of the alien races are minimal or even forgotten, they are not more than plot vehicles, used for action scenes, stereotypical too exotic or too human-like, too onesided evil or good, but here they are unique fractions with strange, but in itself logical and consistent motivations. Overanalyzing, one could go so far as to interpret many philosophical implications into the culture of the species.This wise, just joking, advice is added to all reviews of Hamiltons´series.One of the most fascinating aspects of Hamilton´s future vision is to see the technology and society developing in very detail over long periods of time, making a return to his universe something always stunning and inspiring.

Terry Brooks did an incredible job bringing the action and political intrigue to the page!Admittedly, I am slightly obsessed with the movie The Phantom Menace. Poke fun at me if you must.I've watched the movie a zillion times, so I figured I should probably check out the novelization. It was only then that I discovered it was adapted into book form by the renowned Fantasy author, Terry Brooks!?If you've seen the movie, there will be no great surprises here, but as with most book/movie combos, you can find a lot more information in the book.I feel like the book allows more space to build out some of my favorite characters in the entire universe, like Anakin and Qui-Gon.I think if you are a fan of Star Wars, this is definitely worth a read; consider it supplemental to the movie.I am definitely going to pick up the other novelizations in this prequel trilogy.

Simon Illyan, head of ImpSec and Miles’ former boss, is failing physically and mentally, and Miles sets out to find out why -- and who, if anyone, is behind Illyan’s rapid decline. Library Journal calls Miles “one of the genre’s most enterprising and engaging heroes”. A Hugo and Nebula Award finalist.;"a colleague asked me a series of questions while we were out drinking the other night, questions like So what's next for you? and Is this all you are planning on doing with your career? and Is your current job how you want to be defined and does that actually give you satisfaction? I found myself annoyed then defensive then offended. what gave her the right to question me, I've accomplished a lot in my job and in my life, yes I am content with my career and why the hell shouldn't I be, blah blah blah. in the end I realized that I shouldn't have been offended because I think she was asking me those questions because she was asking herself the same. and so I calmed down and we continued to get drunk while philosophizing on the choices we've made and the nature of our existence blah blah blah.I think some people like to live in boxes. I am such a person. I love my box, it's a safe and comfortable one and I've spent a lifetime constructing it. my box is one that gives me genuine satisfaction and the feeling that I am doing only what I want to be doing with my life. but I think other people resent and reject the idea of a box; they prefer to live in what can be called a ""liminal space"" - that space between, that place of ambiguity and movement and looking towards what comes next. you can look at your goals in life and try to come up with a plan or timeline to achieve those goals. or you can look at your goals and see them as constantly in flux, in movement depending on where you are, liminal. or you can look at yourself and realize that you are actually not a goal-oriented person. I think all of those are different kinds of boxes. I think my colleague may disagree.so this book, Memory, is about those sorts of things. despite opening with a character getting his legs shot off and ending with a high-stakes trap for a devious villain, this is far from an action novel. it is a thoughtful story about who we are, why we are, the boxes we construct, the identities we create for ourselves and the separate boxes those identities live in, how our identity/identities can become dominos or houses of cards falling if something or someone takes those boxes away. Miles Vorkosigan's dual identities of mercenary fleet commander and aristocratic peer of the realm have always been bubbling in the background throughout his stories; in this novel they finally come to a head. Bujold does a superb and moving job in delineating who Miles is, and was, and can be; she gives the mundane, all-too-common situations of making errors & trying to cover up your tracks, losing a job & so losing a part of your identity, a palpably emotional resonance. she does all of that and then she doubles down and gives us another ongoing character, Simon Illyan, going through a similar thing but in an entirely different manner. Miles is the sort of character who assertively rejects the idea of a box and who insists he lives in a liminal space - but who has actually been constructing two boxes to live in, and has actively not been living in the space between, in that liminal space. Simon is the sort of character who has constructed his own perfect box - one that makes his career equal his actual self - only to find that box dismantled and his sureness of purpose and self destroyed as he moves into a purely liminal space. it is fascinating comparing the two journeys.in sum, this is a wonderful novel about figuring out that who you are does not equal your job or your birth name or any specific, singular role or title; rather, it is the sum of all such things, and your experiences, and your internal workings, your actions and your potential, your ability to change or not change, and so much else. you = not easily summed up in one word.I love that this space opera is all about these 'mysteries' that every human experiences. I know when I pick up a Vorkosigan Saga novel that I will be enjoying some action and some intrigue and some political maneuvering and maybe even some romance. standard space opera pleasures. but I also know that I will be enjoying a human tale about actual human beings and the things that happen in life, to everyone. it is that last sentence, that particular quality, that makes this series so special.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61880.Memory

I would suggest only reading Inversions after having read a few other culture novels in close succession; it is very, very subtle but absolutely brilliant.Told from the perspective of two very different characters, one a personal account, the other an amalgamation comprised of a dramatization of events prior and a memoir, it is a story about the brutalities of man, war, sovereignty, and progress.If you're left scratching your head after finishing it, as I have been both times I read it, I highly recommend picking up the Culture Series of Iain M. Banks: A Critical Introduction by Simone Caroti. He brilliantly analyzes and clears up a lot of details in Inversions.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12017.Inversions
Vision of the Future;Timothy Zahn;1997;1990;520;4.1;18705;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo are thrust into the middle of an impending civil war - and discover the shocking truth behind the rumored resurrection of the dead Admiral Thrawn. For a beleaguered Empire, desperate times call for desperate measures. Sowing discord among the fragile coalition of The New Republic, remnants of the once powerful Empire make one last play for victory. Having implicated the Bothans in the genocide of the Caamasi, they now plan an attack on Han and Leia that is also to be blamed on the Bothans. If they are successful, the New Republic will be torn asunder. To prevent inevitable disaster, Luke, Leia, Han, and their friends must prove the Bothans innocent and reveal the Empire's treachery. But time is running out.;"A Quickie ReviewThough George Lucas' space opera is made up of many parts--romance, tragedy, triumph, humor, etc.--the main attractor of Star Wars for most fans is the action. Unfortunately, this last volume of a tie-in duology proved to be a bit light in that department. It still made for somewhat enjoyable reading, but it's not the lightsaber-dueling, interstellar dogfighting adventure that we got on the big screen.Content Concerns: There isn't all that much violence, but one scene does feature a few stabbings.

Honor Among Enemies;David Weber;1996;1990;544;4.27;18469;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Military Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space'];"Despite political foes, professional jealousies, and the scandal which drove her into exile, Capt. Honor Harrington has been offered a chance to reclaim her career as an officer of the Royal Manticoran Navy. But there's a catch. She must assume command of a ""squadron"" of jury-rigged armed merchantmen with crew drawn from the dregs of her service and somehow stop the pirates who have taken advantage of the Havenite War to plunder the Star Kingdom's commerce.";"I came very close for a while to dropping the score for this book even lower. I've enjoyed the series to this point but here..it became a bit of a strain to stay with it for a while.In my own opinion, you could pretty much skip the first third of this book, and miss little or nothing of value to the story. Rehashing and retelling, unneeded details that I suppose some relish. (After all, soap operas have thrived for generations now on details of private lives about this outrageous.) I got very tired of the history of planet systems telling of their colonization from pre-light speed ship Earth on to the present. The story of how a population descended from predominately Chinese ancestors ended up ruled by Bavarian style monarchs...the details of why their light ships work (and retelling me how they work every freaking time you speak of ships going somewhere.) And Oh yes, let's not forget the ""love lives"" of Tree Cats!To make matters worse...well, some people have applied a certain name to the Honor Harrington character I've refused to use. She came close but up till now never crossed the line... Well at least for a while in this book I was convinced that her full name might be Honor ""Mary Sue"" Harrington... Yes our hero. She never met a task she couldn't accomplish, a skill she couldn't master and everyone who meets her either becomes a ""worshiper"" (the author even used the phrase ""idolatry"") or her sworn bitter enemy..and sometimes bitter enemies are CONVERTED to admirers! Shall I go on? It seems the Admiralty can now tell when a Jr. Officer has served under Honor. They all idolize her soooooo much that they begin to model their careers after her.In short there is a huge, ""OH GOOD GRIEF"" factor here for a while.Thankfully somewhere between a third and half way through the book seems to shake itself, look around, blush, and turn back into a competent military science fiction/science fantasy read. I did enjoy the book (partly), and thanks to that recovery will probably move on with the series...hoping against hope that we don't have to go through all and into all the hero worship at the beginning of the next volume.In this one Honor is called back to the Manticarin Navy...as a captain rather than the Admiral she is on Grayson. Her enemies are still around (the ones she hasn't killed that is) and they think getting her back and sending her out on a converted cargo ship to hunt down ""space pirates"" might be a great way to get her killed... Yah right. The Manticarin Admiralty however think this may be a great way just to get ""Super Woman"" back in their Space Navy.Really... I mean I like military science fiction, but I have yet to read a good book (or for that matter see a good movie) about ""space pirates"". Everybody always seems to think it sounds like a good idea, it should be ""cool"". BUT it never seems to work out that way. I don't think it worked out really great here either. However, once we get back into space and the plot actually starts to shape up (we get a little more than the standard ""space pirate"" story)the book is readable and fairly enjoyable. So, from ""ugh"" to ""not bad"". I'll give 3 stars to this space opera for the last third or so.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77739.Honor_Among_Enemies
Shadows of the Empire;Steve Perry;1996;1990;385;3.83;18336;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels'];Here is the untold story of the events that took place between the movies The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi: a novel in which Darth Vader still lives--and battles a villain as powerful and evil as himself.SHADOWS OF THE EMPIREIt is a time of crisis. Han Solo, frozen in carbonite, is being taken to the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt. As Princess Leia mounts a rescue mission including Luke Skywalker, Lando Calrissian, and a brilliant young pilot, Darth Vader pits himself against a cunning and ruthless rival. Xizor is the leader of a powerful crime syndicate who seeks to supplant Vader for the favor of their mutual master, the dreaded Emperor. Their target: Luke Skywalker. Suddenly Luke finds himself the potential prize of the two most evil entities in the galaxy--one who wants him alive...and one who wants him dead.;I recall this book perfectly connected the times between Empire and Return of the Jedi. Boba Fett versus bounty hunters, the sinister Black Sun org, and Bothan spies! At last, all the classic characters set up for the big moment at Jabba's palace. So... is this still canon? Why not? I do understand that post-Disney most of the EU had to be thrown away if we are to have the new films, but why disregard the period before that...As far as I'm concerned, everything which predates that should remain canon. Then, after the Battle of Endor the timeline was split between two different New Republic era alternate realities.

The Rowan;Anne McCaffrey;1990;1990;336;4.05;17772;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Audiobook', 'Paranormal'];Told in the timeless style of Anne McCaffrey, The Rowan is the first installment in a wonderful trilogy. This is sci-fi at its best: a contemporary love story as well as an engrossing view of our world in the future.The kinetically gifted, trained in mind/machine gestalt, are the most valued citizens of the Nine Star League. Using mental powers alone, these few Prime Talents transport ships, cargo and people between Earth's Moon, Mars' Demos and Jupiter's Callisto.An orphaned young girl, simply called The Rowan, is discovered to have superior telepathic potential and is trained to become Prime Talent on Callisto. After years of self-sacrificing dedication to her position, The Rowan intercepts an urgent mental call from Jeff Raven, a young Prime Talent on distant Deneb. She convinces the other Primes to merge their powers with hers to help fight off an attack by invading aliens. Her growing relationship with Jeff gives her the courage to break her status-imposed isolation, and choose the more rewarding world of love and family.;"Look, I read a lot of McCaffrey when I was younger; I adored Pern, enjoyed Acorna, and even attempted Acorna's Children despite my deep fear of plagues and dislike of plague plots in fiction. I never got around to The Rowan, I think largely because it had Sexy Women on the front and I knew that, as a middle schooler, that was not the kind of book I should be carrying around. But nearly 10 years down the line here I am, having tracked this book down in a quest to whittle away at my To-Read shelf.And boy, am I glad I didn't read it as a kid. Feeling this disappointed with an author I had loved* is bad enough, but if I had loved the book? This would have been devastating.(*with full acknowledgement of all of the frankly fucked-up views Anne McCaffrey held, I still like some of her work and nearly cried when I heard she had passed away.)This book is just... bad. There's no other word for it. As other reviewers have commented, it's interesting for about the first third, but then rapidly degenerates - as if McCaffrey forgot what a book is, or that plot and character development and conflict are key parts of a story, in the frankly incomprehensible desire to push the character of Jeff Raven to center stage.Let's be real here: Jeff Raven ruined this entire story. You see that plot synopsis about how the Rowan was destined to be the greatest Talent? Bullshit. Jeff Raven is stronger than she is. Not only that, but he's got no weaknesses - the Rowan, in one of the few examples of conflict this book has to offer, fights to overcome a fear of space travel, but Jeff can already do it right off the bat! (As a super special bonus, he denigrates her for being afraid and struggling with that fear.) He's charming and attractive, despite being incredibly overbearing and patronizing! A single contact with his mind and the Rowan is in love, and everything interesting about her is thrown out the window. Before his arrival, she was powerful but flawed, prone to brattishness, fear, and insecurity; after she's mellowed and complacent and consistently plays second fiddle.This could have been a character study of its titular character: McCaffrey could have explored the very real effects of the trauma Rowan suffered as a child, her effective indentured servitude to FT&T (and the limits thereof, because it was never clear how much freedom a Prime had to say 'no'), the structure of a society with all of these mental abilities... but instead there's a ham-fisted 'romance' and an even more ham-fisted alien threat, both of which are resolved quickly and without any struggle at all. If this were a debut novel I'd ask if the writer had ever heard of a try-fail cycle, but Dragonflight came out over 20 years before this.There's no excuse. There's really not.Some thoughts on McCaffrey's bizarre attitudes towards sex below.Having read a lot of her work before I wasn't entirely unprepared, but goddamn does the way she treats sex and romance have deep-rooted issues. There's the casual brushing-off of women who aren't sexually active/sexy (Capella, Siglen) as somehow lesser and out of touch with their emotions, which I kind of expect from sci-fi writers of a certain age anyway, but then... pretty much as soon as Jeff and Rowan meet in person, they fall into bed. You could write this off as their mind-meld thing having already told them everything they needed to know about each other, but we don't really see that intimacy - it's just that they're suddenly in love, and then they're even more suddenly fucking, and the cherry on top of the cake is that they can basically engage in... mind-sex, or at least mind-foreplay, pretty much all the time.Which Jeff does. Whenever he feels like it. His behavior is basically... if he were physically present, he'd be feeling Rowan up at work, or outright fingering her. There's no conversation about consent - about whether he should be trying to get her turned on while she's at work, or whether she's okay with him having that kind of control over her body. It's honestly really creepy, especially since it feels like they don't really know each other at all, and because the Rowan generally becomes passive and pliant around him as the book progresses. Moreover, she never returns the favor, which creates this godawful setup in which the hero has constant sexual access to the heroine's body, and she's only allowed to express her sexuality when he's already initiated it. (it's a sharp contrast with the first portion of the book, in which she sets out to seduce an older man and succeeds - where did that Rowan go?)And then there's the retrieval of her memories. A lot of negative reviews have talked about this, but it's honestly so awful that I have to add my voice to the chorus: what the FUCK happened here? Bad enough that he shows up furious with her for trying to help his planet (what?), but that he then uses that as impetus to tear her brain apart just makes it so much worse. The whole paragraph is shockingly violent:Jeff's tone had abruptly altered and his eyes narrowed. He caught her by the shoulders then and before she guessed his intention, he had pierced through every layer of privacy in her mind. She cried out at the force of his mental penetration as he also broke through the block that had remained intact against every other invasion.It's... pretty clear from the way that this is written that, howevermuch McCaffrey writes about his 'tenderness' afterward, this was not a loving gesture. This was a brutish exercise of power, in which Jeff used his strength to try and fix her, but never bothered to ask if she wanted to be fixed, or if she was comfortable with the intrusion. Moreover, he never faces consequences for this, never has to apologize for his methods or his presumption. It's another manifestation of that entitlement McCaffrey gave him to the Rowan's mind and body, and it's honestly terrifying. (It's also an example of plot points being overcome without effort - there's no technical skill required, just raw force, and the Rowan barely struggles with the restoration of her memories. Why does no one have to work at anything in this damn book?)";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61938.The_Rowan

Once again I am going to sound like a fan-girl, but I can't help it! This series has stolen my heart. I know I have several series of books which I love and are a must read for me, but most of them are more because the story lines are not finished, and the worlds are marvelous, and the writing is great, and I really enjoy the characters... and so on. However, of all of those, The Vorkosigan Saga is the one that I have the most tenderness for. It makes me think, it makes me feel, and it makes me appreciate the more imperfect of the human emotions, the issues we are dealing with in one way or another on daily basis but disguised in a Sci-Fi form. On top of that, as the main protagonist we have Miles, a young man whom we have followed for several years and his evolution form a kid to an adult has been spellbinding... I fill like he is my kid, or more correctly, as if he is my sister's kid and I get to claim and be proud of him and his achievements even though I have been just an observer in his life... He is bigger than life, but packed in a small frame and vulnerable psyche. I love this character so much, he is quickly becoming one of my favorite of all time!

In orbit. the Oversoul realizes that it has lost access to some of its memory banks. and some of its power systems are failing. And on the planet. men are beginning to think about power. wealth. and conquest.;"Here's the biggest problem with this book: Card's a terrible world-builder. (Okay, the biggest problem might've been that whoever edited this book didn't feel comfortable telling Orson Scott Card that big chunks needed to be rewritten or scrapped, but I can't be too hard on our hypothetical editor: this book came out in 92, right when Card was big.) Sure, he's fine when telling us about his world - this is a book about a matriarchy, a city ruled by women, a city where women hold power, and no man can spend even one night inside the city's walls if he doesn't spend that night in a woman's house. Okay. Fair enough; a little ridiculous, but okay, I'll play Fantasy Matriarchy with you, Card. How do we play? Oh, well, it's a matriarchy, but every guard mentioned in the narrative is a man. Oh! Unmarried men cannot spend the night in the city unless they spend it in a woman's house...unless they're the men selling goods and services in the market, because those markets are open 24-7. Is there a curfew? Is there any way to enforce this particular rule, or are we on the honor system? Spoiler: throughout the book, hahaha nope, we are on the honor system. Oh! Uh, if we're talking construction, all of the construction workers are burly men, by the way. Oh! If we're talking politics: the protagonist's mom has some sway, politically speaking, but every other named character with any influence in the politics of the city is a man. So in this matriarchy, Card gives us one (1) woman with a speaking role who's shown to have political power, and three (3) men with political ambitions and power. Oh! Um, also every merchant selling goods or handling money is shown to be a man, and all the bankers and stewards mentioned in the book are men. (There's a couple of merchants explicitly identified as female who sell...poetry and history and pornography, but I trust I don't need to explain why this is Not the Matriarchy I'm looking for.) How is this a matriarchy? Good question! Men have 75% of the political power, and men are the guards and bankers and construction workers and explorers and tradesmen, and they can enter and leave the city with impunity, and women are singers and dancers and teachers and raise each other's kids, and a couple of them are scientists, and a couple of them are politicians, but mostly: they are actresses and teachers and homemakers. This is not a Matriarchy, you're scowling. Where are the men crushed under the stiletto of oppression? I knooooow, I tell you. Look, this is what Card thinks is a matriarchy: exactly the same as the US, circa mid 1980s, but only women are allowed to own residential property inside the city proper, there's a special religious lake that men aren't allowed to visit, and people sign marriage contracts with each other that only last one year. (ONLY HETERO MARRIAGE. So basically: no-fault divorce is legal, but marriage is still only one man, one women, and gays are still icky, and there is DEFINITELY only two natural genders - which, by the way, is presumably why every man in the book spends 80% of his time panicking about whether he is Manning the Right Way, haha, lil sarcasm for you there - and no one is ever transgender.) Oh oh! There are ""wilders"" - naked desert women who wander into Matriarchy City, where the women of Matriarchy City consider them holy and sacred, but ...it is so common for men to rape them in the street that there's slang phrases that have developed to describe the act. Your Evil Oppressive Matriarchy, folks! Tremble at all of this sexy Male Oppression, y'know? So there's that trainwreck. Look, just...it needs an EDITOR so badly. Like all of Card's work, our protagonist is a boy whose one weakness is that he is Too Smart, right? So when we're in his head, it is generally acknowledged that his observations and perceptions are correct. There's a line in this book where the protagonist seriously considers who is ""better,"" the ""brutal but rational men, or the irrational but gentle women,"" when he's comparing their styles of worship. SPOILERS: in this book, women worship by going down to their sacred lake, jumping in the water, and tripping balls. Their magic computer gives them hallucinations, but only in that lake. In this book, men worship by going into a fountain and tearing themselves up with barbed rings. Everyone bleeds into the same water. It is apparently considered pious to submerge your freshly-wounded body in this mix of god-knows-how-many-men's-blood and water*. Why? WHO THE FUCK KNOWS? The only rational explanation is ""because otherwise how will you be SURE that everyone has the same amount of hep C and HIV?"" but I don't...think that's what Card was going for. But remember! Men: brutal, rational, (ALL INFECTED WITH EVERY SINGLE DISEASE). Women: gentle, irrational, (AND YET NOT THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE POPULATION WITH A HARDY STRAIN OF SYPHILIS.) I could continue picking out the stupid bits - this is a city that doesn't have wagons because wheels are forbidden, and the city is not DIRECTLY on the coast, but somehow shark fights that take place in pools inside the side are big enough that they're a commonly accepted cultural practice. (No, really. These people carry their goods in caravans on camelback. Explain in detail how you would transport a shark from the ocean to the shark pool without a wagon or wheeled conveyance of some fucking kind.) The whole book is like this! Maddening, weird, nonsensical bits that don't fit with anything else that Card has told us about this world that he's building. It's a promising first draft from an aspiring writer who's not bad but needs a lot of technical guidance? But not really worth money, honestly. *this practice is first seen through the eyes of the (probably?) fourteen-year-old protagonist, while he's naked, waist deep in a ""swirling, thick mix"" of other men's blood and water"". there might be a way to interpret this that does not make you want to call Chris Hansen. good luck; i haven't found it.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92956.The_Memory_of_Earth

Thanks to an experimental drug that he received during his youth, Colin can see ""nodal points"" in the vast streams of data that make up the worldwide computer network. Nodal points are rare but significant events in history that forever change society, even though they might not be recognizable as such when they occur. Colin isn't quite sure what's going to happen when society reaches this latest nodal point, but he knows it's going to be big. And he knows it's going to occur on the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, which has been home to a sort of SoHo-esque shantytown since an earthquake rendered it structurally unsound to carry traffic.Although All Tomorrow's Parties includes characters from two of Gibson's earlier novels, it's not a direct sequel to either. It's a stand-alone book.--Craig E. Engler";The thing to remember when beginning and reading a William Gibson novel is to stay with it to the end.I’m a Gibson fan but even I know he can be difficult to follow, especially in the first few dozen pages, or the first third, or half …Anyway, Gibson’s 1999 summation of his Bridge trilogy, begun in Virtual Light and (sort of) continuing in Idoru, finds him winding things up nicely on the bridge in San Francisco in an alternate future where much of society has broken down and changed into an anarcho-capitalistic world building reminiscent of Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash.Actually, the Bridge trilogy is more closely held together than either of the Sprawl or Blue Ant trilogies (which were more or less stand alone novels tied in with the same world building.)Gibson’s great imagination and his succinctly descriptive writing is as good as ever.Recommended (but for this one a reader will really want to read the first two books in the Bridge series first.);https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22321.All_Tomorrow_s_Parties

Banks has something prophetic in mind in ""Against a Dark Background,"" but it may have been a bit too subtle for most of the critics to get.Banks isn't writing a cheesy adventure story; he's not creating a science fiction galaxy for entertainment purposes; he's not playing around at all. He's offering us a warning of what's to come if we keep moving the way we are. He presents a galaxy full of technological wonders where thermonuclear war is tactical and a part of regular business, a galaxy where religions and corporations take the place of countries and legislate their desires through a world court, a galaxy where all is part of an enlightened dark age where the amazing is terrible and the adventurous is appalling.""Against a Dark Background"" is vintage Banks -- much more than it seems and well worth the read.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/422452.Against_a_Dark_Background

Salvatore;1999;1990;416;3.84;16303;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels'];"Twenty-one years have passed since the heroes of the Rebel Alliance destroyed the Death Star, breaking the power of the Emperor. Since then, the New Republic has valiantly struggled to maintain peace and prosperity among the peoples of the galaxy. But unrest has begun to spread and threatens to destroy the Republic's tenuous reign.Into this volatile atmosphere comes Nom Anor, a charismatic firebrand who heats passions to the boiling point, sowing seeds of dissent for his own dark motives. And as the Jedi and the Republic focus on internal struggles, a new threat surfaces from beyond the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim--an enemy bearing weapons and technology unlike anything New Republic scientists have ever seen.Suddenly, Luke Skywalker; his wife, Mara; Han Solo; Leia Organa Solo; and Chewbacca--along with the Solo children--are thrust again into battle, to defend the freedom so many have fought and died for. But this time, the power of the Force itself may not be enough . . .";I have been hearing people rave about this series in the Star Wars universe and I am finally checking this out. I haven't read any Salvatore, so this was my first experience with the author. I simply can't believe how they brought something so new to the Star Wars universe that feels like a real threat. I was spoiled on a plot detail, so I knew what was coming. The movies should have done something like this. It could have taken bits and pieces of the series and made something special out of this series. It's fresh and new and the story line needed something different.I enjoyed how we had several different story points starting the story. We were on a planet of scientist, there was Han, Luke and Chewie and then Mara and Leia to start off with. The story had me engaged and I was enjoying being in the universe again with Jedi. I love seeing Han and Leia's kids. They have twins and then a single, 3 in all. They make up a great family and I enjoy seeing Luke married to Mara Jade. Just what I want. They all live on the edge of death all the time it seems. I would think that would get old, maybe it means I'm old.I thought all the elements of the Vong were great and really creepy. They have to be the best villains ever. The warriors come from outside the galaxy as an invading force and they don't use any technology. They even hate technology, like they are offended by it. They were easy to root against.Parts of Salvatore's writing were enjoyable, but I agree with others that he did sort of spoil what was going on. I also thought some of the characters thinking about other characters were strange. The way Luke talks about 3PO was so odd. He didn't say it out loud, but it almost felt like Shakespeare, oh noble 3PO can figure it out, kind of thing. Not exact words.I can't believe I didn't read these as they were coming out. I do plan on reading the rest of New Jedi Order. It feels like the force is once again rising. I enjoyed the philosophical arguments Jacen and Anakin were having about how to use the force. I did enjoy the movies, but I thought they really messed up killing off most of the Jedi. Star Wars is the Jedi, otherwise, it's not the Star Wars universe, at least not to me. I love how many Jedi were at work here and how the Vong were outside the force and with their own type of force. We simply need more Jedi and I could give a fig about Sith. Begone and stay gone, I say. There were some amazing ideas in this story and it's too bad Disney ignored them all. At least we have the books.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192214.Vector_Prime
Flashforward;Robert J. Sawyer;1999;1990;320;3.65;16238;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Thriller'];FLASHFORWARDTwo minutes and seventeen seconds that changed the worldSuddenly, without warning, all seven billion people on Earth black out for more than two minutes. Millions die as planes fall from the sky, people tumble down staircases, and cars plow into each other.But that’s the least of the survivors’ challenges. During the blackout, everyone experienced a glimpse of what his or her future holds—and the interlocking mosaic of these visions threatens to unravel the present.;"There are so many ways I could pay tribute to this book (audiobook), which was an awful piece of writing, but an entertaining way to spend ten hours in a car.Perhaps a drinking game (NOT in the car):RULE: Drink every time a character is identified by his or her hair color.*RULE:Drink every time someone uses the word ""indeed"" in an internal monologue.RULE: Drink every time someone answers their own question within an internal monologue a la ""Yes? Yes!"" or ""No? No!""RULE: Drink every time a character ruminates extensively to himself in between the numbers of a countdown.No? No. Maybe this would be better suited to a different list:Tips On Good Writing, the Robert J. Sawyer Way:1. Anything worth writing about is worth writing about in excrutiating detail. This includes bodily functions, routine tasks, and subway stations.2. The onomatopeia is your friend. Don't be afraid to let a bullet go ""KABLAM!"" 3. Any hackneyed action phrase worth using once is worth using once or twice more in the chapter. 4. Get creative! Why have a character simply smile when instead you can have someone ""feel his features stretch into a grin""? After all, you don't just smile with your mouth. 5. Everything has a sound, so make sure to get those details in there. Hair rustles if you shake your head while lying on a pillow (maybe I need a new conditioner?). Shoes slap against stairs (at least mine do; I got them at Bozo's Clown Warehouse).6. Character development is crucial, and again detail is key. That's why you can't just have a character remember that he once ran a marathon. He should remember that he once ran from Marathon to Athens, a trip of precisely 26.2 miles, in a recreation of the famous historical run which gave marathon running its name.7. Don't be sexist! Women can be smart, too. They can be engineers and physicists. They are also scared of all male strangers, and keep their eye on the exits when talking to one.8. The future will be very different from now. It's fun to speculate on the differences both in passing comments, like mentioning how blue jeans will be out of style, or in expositional paragraphs. Preferably lots of them. 9. If you get bored identifying characters by hair color, you can identify them by eye color instead. Get it in there as soon as possible, even if it means having one character see another's grey eyes in a darkened tunnel from a distance of 50 metres. 10. Every character should be from a different country. This is called diversity, and helps when you're trying to come up with hair colors and names.--Does the audiobook format make me more critical of an author's style, or do I always choose laughably terrible audiobooks? In either case, I was curious to read the book that inspired ABC's mediocre Lost-wannabe Flash Forward series, and figured it would help pass the time on a couple of roadtrips. It was a GREAT way to pass the time, since my sister and I spent the entire 10ish hours mocking it MST3K-style. *Bonus excerpt from the first chapter: ""Lloyd Simcoe, a Canadian-born researcher, sat at the injection console. He was forty-five, tall, and clean-shaven. His eyes were blue and his crewcut hair so dark brown that one could get away with calling it black - except at the temples, where about half of it had turned gray.""Two paragraphs later:""Seated on his right, in front of the detector console, was the master of the makeover herself, his fiancee, enginer Michiko Komura. Ten years Lloyd's junior at thirty five, Michiko had a small upturned nose and lustrous black hair that she had styled in the currently popular page boy cut.""Next paragraph:""Theo had curly, thick, dark hair, gray eyes, and a prominent, jutting jaw.""";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337132.Flashforward

But when Dicken finds what he’s looking for, the answer proves to be stranger—and far deadlier—than he ever could have imagined. Something that has slept in human DNA for millions of years is waking up.Molecular biologist Kaye Lang has spent her career tracing ancient retroviruses in the human genome. She believes these microscopic fossils can come to life again. But when Dicken’s discovery becomes public, Lang’s theory suddenly turns to chilling fact. As the outbreak of this terrifying disease threatens to become a deadly epidemic, Dicken and Lang must race against time to assemble the pieces of a puzzle only they are equipped to solve—an evolutionary puzzle that will determine the future of the human race . . . if a future exists at all.;"So I keep on reading Bear novels, feeling disappointed, waiting a while, then rinse and repeat.This time I've clarified why I am so ambivalent about this guy: he has fascinating ideas then writes dull books about them. The premise here is an extreme example. Our ""junk"" DNA turns out to be a collection of emergency rapid-response evolutionary accelerators - and the emergency response has just been triggered. Cue mysterious pregnancies, peculiar facial mutations and a really big scientific mystery that turns very political very fast. The detail is very convincing - Bear did a heap of research.But here's the problem: almost every event of a dramatic nature happens off-stage and the middle part of the book, between the initial scientific drama and the political nightmare at the end bogs down severely. Then, to add insult to injury, the book closes before the new generation of evolved humans reaches their teens, so the social consequences are not fully explored (but there is a sequel). It looks like things are heading into X-Men territory, but of course more seriously treated, or, more precisely, in the vein of Nancy Kress's Sleepless books.There is a theme of the disaster that occurs when science gets forced into the political arena; you only have to look at the climate change debate to know how that goes. It is very realistically handled but develops too slowly. I am reminded of Kim Stanley Robinson. Several of his works deal with science and internal and external politics and how real science is done and I can't help thinking a more interesting novel would have resulted if he had started with the same material.I acquired Darwin's Children without realising that it was a sequel and then picked up this book subsequently. I will probably read Darwin's Children at some point, since it is lying around and because it really ought to cut to the chase, with the background already painted in with excessive attention to detail but I shall try to resist the urge to buy any more Bear novels regardless of how interesting the premise sounds...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64923.Darwin_s_Radio

The war is about to enter a phase of unprecedented ferocity . . . and the Alliance is on the short end of the stick.But even as powerful Peep fleets hurtle towards their objectives, neither they nor the Alliance are aware of events occurring on a distant, isolated, inescapable prison planet called Hell. For what no one knows, not even State Security, is that Honor Harrington is not dead. She and a handful of her people are trapped on Hell, and determined to disprove the Peep boast that no one can ever escape it. Honor Harrington is going home, and taking her people with her... even if she has to conquer Hell to do it.;I remembered this book as being the perfect place to end the series. I was wrong, dammit. Too much is left hanging, but the ending is awesome. The basic story is awesome, but Weber's writing is beginning to get on my nerves. Info dumps - there are too many of them & he's expanding beyond the necessary - an ugly trend - adding in details & back story that I don't much care for. I just don't see where it helps the story beyond padding it. This includes drawn 'plans' for weapons in the front of the book instead of a star map. Please! Inconsistent rules - People are known by their names & their titles. Why mention 2 people by name & the third by his title? He does similar things with ship & missile accelerations. Why should I have to mentally convert back & forth? It's like telling me two cars are driving down the road, one at 66 mph & the other at 100 Kph in the same sentence. That's about the same speed, but it doesn't help the story to jump from one to another. It's just annoying.This was a 2 star book because of all the annoyances, but I'm giving it 3 because the basic story is excellent as is the ending.

I really should have. But child-me shipped Han and Leia before I knew what shipping was and I just wanted a fun, cute story about them, okay?? Instead we got this: (spoilers? Does anyone care?)Our story starts with Alien Micheal Bolton proposing to LeiaApparently his name is Isolder and he's a prince of this super fabulous and rich planet system. He saw her once and thought she was hot, so he brings her ships full of gold and proposes to her on some business meeting being live streamed to all of the New Republic(Why don't people ever see me once, decide they love me and bring me copious amounts of gold?)Jedi Luke is on some space roadtripFor literally the entire first 100 pages. I don't remember where he was going, I'm not sure he knew. He just kept talking to R2 and setting a new courseDespite being in a relationship with Han Solo, Leia seriously considers Alien Micheal's proposal(After she accepts the gold of course.) But she gives neither of them an answer and they have numerous allegorical dick-measuring contests and fight over her. 
""General Solo, what can you really offer Leia?""""She loves me and I love her. That's enough.""""If you love her, then leave her to me!""

 ""Well, lets see..."" Threepio said. ""Isolder is extremely wealthy, generous, well-mannered, and-- at least by human standards--attractive. So now all we have to do is see what you have to offer that he doesn't have."" Threepio searched his files for several moments, overheating his memory drives. ""Oh dear! I see your problem!""
Han gets insecure and decides to play some space card game to win enough money to impress LeiaHis winning hand consisted of ""the two of sabers, the Evil One and the Idiot"" He wins a planet. Because plot. After less than 30 pages, Leia decides she no longer loves Han and wants to marry Micheal Bolton Page 37: ""Look, I don't know why people would even think that I'd marry the prince. So don't listen to them. Listen to me. I love you for what you are--remember? A rebel, a scoundrel, a braggart. That won't ever change.""Page 53: Leia found herself crying, had never really imagined that she would let something like this happen. But at that moment, whatever attachment she had ever felt for Han suddenly seemed to become as insubstantial as fog, as a gentle white mist, and Isolder was the sun, burning it all away. With tears running down her cheeks she tangled her arms around Isolder and promised, ""I'll come with you!""Han doesn't react to this news well, and instead stuns Leia with his gun, locks her in the cargo bay of the Falcon and flies to the planet he won.  
""You used to love me. You believed it, and you made me believe it. I thought our love was something special, something I would gladly die for, and I'm not going to throw away our future just because some other prince comes along. 
Umm... where is the Han who calmly faced possible death with an ""I know"" and told Chewie to look after Leia? And was going to leave and let Luke and Leia be together (before he learned about that ancient plot twist in Ep. VI). This is all so out of character and creepy.Luke feels a disturbance, comes back from his roadtrip and teams up with Micheal BoltonMicheal turns into Menelaus after Helen runs off with Paris and vows to get ""his"" woman back. Luke goes with him, because Micheal has a scary empress mommy who wants to kill Han. Han and Leia crash land on 'his' planet and end up camping in the jungle for like 100 pagesAnd hiding from big scary creatures.
""Come on, come on, you guys!"" Han said. ""Let's have an organized retreat here."" ""Fine,"" Threepio said, ""you organize while I retreat."" 
(Did I mention Han takes Chewie and C3PO with him when he kidnaps Leia?? Because apparently to reignite the flame of romance, you need your Wookiee best friend and protocol droid) Of course, they become prisoners who are fought over by force-witches and some warlord.""We'll be very happy to pry those answers out of you-- along with your toenails--during your interrogation!""While looking for the prisoners, Luke decides Micheal is force-sensitiveThis leads to several chapters of Luke ""probing"" him about his past, making him cry and sing, and then ultimately being kidnapped by another group of ""force-witches"" Luke bonds with Teneniel, one of the witches, and they discover an old Jedi templeThis includes a montage where Luke is revealed to be so powerful he no longer sweats, can carry women miles in the woods, and heal most wounds. Teneniel also declares Michael Bolton her slave, and reports her society of witches are allowed to buy and sell men. Han sells his planet back to his kidnappers, in exchange for Leia's hand in marriage But the witches say they won't force her hand, and instead Threepio attempts to persuade her through song and dance. 
""He's got his own planetAlthough it's kind of wild.Wookiee's love him.Women love him.He's got a winning smile!Though he may seem cool and cocky, He's more sensitive than he seems,(Chorus sung in accompaniment with three women who all sound like Leia)Han Solo,What a man! Solo.He's every princess's dream!"" 
 (I swear I wish I was making this up)Then, as if realizing there's plot to resolve, the last 100 pages are confusing and rushed battle scenesI'm still not sure who was fighting who or what the tactics were, but our guys win so yay?(Somehow it involves Han strapping a detonator on himself and marching into some war meeting. Leia finds this all really mature and hot) Han and Leia decide they are in love again(Assault and kidnapping be damned!) 
""Han bent down and kissed her fiercely, passionately, and the blood thundered in her ears. Leia suddenly realized how much she had missed this, missed feeling such raw, elemental fervor for a man. 
 Alas, Alien Micheal Bolton, it was not meant to be. (But for real, the suicide bomber thing really turns her on) 
""I've got to say, you really look good with a bomb strapped to you.""
Side note: is it a good idea to make out while someone HAS A BOMB STRAPPED TO THEM? Because it seems like a FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED course of action. Don't feel too bad for Micheal, because he decides to marry the witch who claimed him as a slaveBecause he's into that, apparently. Han and Leia get married without ever having a real conversation the entire bookHan does yell out ""Kiss my Wookiee!"" in battle, and after that, are words really needed? In Conclusion:Idk man, this was more of a recap than a review because I'm still trying to process everything. Hands down one of the most poorly written, horribly constructed and ooc messes I've ever read-- but it was also one of the most fun and I laughed so hard??";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/161540.The_Courtship_of_Princess_Leia

And as Davy explores his new power he learns that the world is literally his for the taking. But there are consequences too, as Davy will learn.";I've wanted to read this ever since I watched the Jumper movie. Teleportation movies and books are always fun. The biggest surprise is that this book was nothing like the movie. The only thing they had in common was the teleporting main character. This was a surprisingly dark sci-fi that spent more time pondering moral dilemmas and exploring Davey's emotional reaction to the various mishaps that befell him than it did on action sequences. The action and the pace did pick up a bit towards the end. Davey was a tortured soul with a bit of bitterness about him, but for all his faults he was mostly likable. Overall this was an enjoyable sci-fi read worth a 4 star rating. I'll definitely read the rest of the books in the series at some point.Audio Note: The ever reliable Macleod Andrews gave a decent performance.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47970.Jumper

Heinlein, Poul Anderson, Bradbury, de Camp, H.G. Wells, Vonnegut, Twain, and Piers Anthony to name just a few. There seems to be as many approaches to the time travel conundrum as there are writers, but generally falling into one of two camps. There is the classic paradox scenario where a time traveller actually goes back in time and is a part of the action and so perhaps changes his own destiny. There is also the time traveller as voyeur, where the agent can only view and report. This is a little of both.Setting up a time travel process whereby scientists can “see” into the past, the sightseers make an astonishing discovery that perhaps they can be seen and influence those in the past. From here comes the next step of travel, and so Card is off.The subject is good ole Christopher Columbus and his world-changing voyage. Should he have gone east instead of west to influence the Crusades? What would that be like? Could travellers making influential changes create a worse result?

Anderson;1994;1990;368;3.64;15217;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Novels'];As the New Republic takes devastating losses in the ongoing war with the scattered remnants of the Empire, the galaxy's future depends on three small children–among them the Jedi twins—born to incredible powers and perils, as an extraordinary new Star Wars saga unfolds… While the New Republic struggles to decide what to do with the deadly Sun Crusher—a new doomsday weapon stolen from the Empire by Han Solo—the renegade Imperial Admiral Daala uses her fleet of Star Destroyers to conduct guerrilla warfare on peaceful planets. And now she threatens the watery homeworld of Admiral Ackbar. But as the battle for a planet rages, an even greater danger arises at Luke Skywalker's Jedi academy. A brilliant student delves dangerously into the dark side of the Force and unleashes the spirit of an ancient master of the evil order that warped Darth Vader himself. Working together, they may become an enemy greater than any the New Republic has ever fought… more powerful than even a Jedi Master can face.;"The Good: This second outing is just as much spacefaring fun as the first one. The ending makes me glad I have the next and final installment already on hand. I liked the writing as well.The Bad: Nothing, really; I just save the highest score for truly amazing works.Conclusion: The Star Wars Expanded Universe has been around so long that everyone has already formed an opinion on it.

Anderson;1994;1990;373;3.67;14402;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Novels'];Suspended helplessly between life and death, Luke Skywalker lies in state at the Jedi academy. But on the spirit plane, Luke fights desperately for survival, reaching out physically to the Jedi twins. At the same time, Leia is on a life-and-death mission of her own, a race against Imperial agents hoping to destroy a third Jedi child -- Leia and Han's baby Anakin -- hidden on the planet Anoth. Meanwhile, Luke's former proté gé Kyp Durron has pirated the deadly Sun Crusher on an apocalyptic mission of mass destruction, convinced he is fighting for a just cause. Hunting down the rogue warrior, Han must persuade Kyp to renounce his dark crusade and regain his lost honor. To do it, Kyp must take the Sun Crusher on a suicide mission against the awesome Death Star prototype -- a battle Han knows they may be unable to win... even with Luke Skywalker at their side!;"Never again with this series! If I ever, ever get the urge to re-read it again, somebody smack me in my face-ular area.In all seriousness, I can’t tell if this book was genuinely better than the last one or not, because I sped-read most of it, focused only on the parts that caught my attention, and skipped large chunks of it that seemed stupid or boring. Anyway, it didn’t fill me with rage.I’m not going to go into huge detail, or really any detail at all, in this review. I have already more than said my piece in my long and longer reviews of books one and two.This one has the task of cleaning up the mess from before. Luke is unconscious in a Jedi fashion after being attacked by Kyp Durron and his spiritual stowaway Exar Kun, and coincidentally Leia and Han’s two year old Jedi twins are the only ones who can see his spirit floating around. At one point they have to wield his lightsaber. Yeah, a two year old wields a lightsaber. I have no energy to mock it right now, so just know that I would like to and leave it at that. Meanwhile the remnant of the Empire that is after the baby Jedi because REASONS? (Seriouslly, what the eff makes them think that a baby will be a good asset for them?? As I said in one of my status updates:“He’s a BABY. What the what are you going to do with a BABY. Just because he has Jedi powers doesn’t mean you can make him your own Emperor. And what, he won’t even be an adult for twenty years! By then, the Empire will be gone. Great plan, asshole!""Then there’s this whole black hole thing that is a joke and Daala fucks shit up and there is a nearly hundred page battle I skipped entirely, which turned out to be a good idea because KJA summed it all up at the end anyway so I literally missed nothing.In summation, these are not good Star Wars books. They are not good books in the standard of books in general. You should not read them.[First read, February 2001]";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/513207.Champions_of_the_Force
Cordelia's Honor;Lois McMaster Bujold;1996;1990;596;4.33;14132;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space'];"This a previously-published edition of ISBN 9780671578282, newer one here.In her first trial by fire, Cordelia Naismith captained a throwaway ship of the Betan Expeditionary Force on a mission to destroy an enemy armada. Discovering deception within deception, treachery within treachery, she was forced into a separate peace with her chief opponent, Lord Aral Vorkosigan - he who was called ""The Butcher of Komarr"" - and would consequently become an outcast on her own planet and the Lady Vorkosigan on his. Sick of combat and betrayal, she was ready to settle down to a quiet life, interrupted only by the occasional ceremonial appearances required of the Lady Vorkosigan. But when the Emperor died, Aral suddenly became guardian of the infant heir to the imperial throne of Barrayar - and the target of high-tech assassins in a dynastic civil war that was reminiscent of earth's Middle Ages, but fought with up-to-the minute biowar technology. Neither Aral nor Cordelia guessed the part that their cell-damaged unborn son would play in Barrayar's bloody legacy. This edition includes an author's afterword, and a chronology of the events in the Vorkosigan Saga series. Cover art by Gary Ruddell.";"Shards of Honour - 3.5 Stars This was a fun start to an interesting series. The main characters were likeable and interesting (especially the gradual reveal of Vorkosigan's past) and the plot was fast-paced, filled with a series of exciting adventures. The world-building was solid but nowhere near as ambitious, intriguing and memorable as the first book in the other sci-fi series I have experience with (Hyperion). The secondary characters were for the most part also not particularly remarkable with the exception of the menacing and tormented Sergeant Bothari. I'm definitely interested to see where this series goes from here, especially in how the weird publication vs. reading vs. chronological order debate will effect the series' development.Aftermaths - 4.5 stars This was a short story that only had a tenuous connection to the events of the 2 main books. With the setting of 2 characters aboard a small space-ship on a mission to recover the bodies of those killed in a recent war the tone was suitably subdued and introspective. Overall I found this to be a somewhat creepy but deeply poignant story. Barrayar- 4 starsJumping around a bit in reading book 7 after book 1 in this series but it worked pretty well. This book started out brilliantly with some understated (well as understated as assassination attempts and high risk experimental surgeries can be) family turmoil, politics and character development taking center stage. While it wasn't particularly dramatic Bujold's masterful writing of interesting, nuanced characters kept me engaged. With the introduction of a much larger and more interesting supporting cast than in the first book it's become obvious that writing characters is Bujold's greatest strength: her world-building is pretty shallow and the plots are for the most part straightforward and over reliant on somewhat cliched adventures but Bujold has now written an impressive cast of colourful, nuanced characters. Especially interesting in this book were Droushnakovi the female bodyguard who defies the expectations of a warrior society where women aren't supposed to have anything to do with war, Princess Kareen who was convincingly written as a woman who had been forced into a series of horrific and difficult situations while struggling to survive and protect her young son, Count Piotr a decorated old officer whose old-fashioned values bring him into conflict with the main character and especially Sergeant Bothari who was a complex and compelling character in the last book and becomes even more so here as we learn more about his background and motivations.However about half-way through the book the focus turned into an isolated trek through the countryside that just seemed to drag on and on. And on. By the time the plot returned to the important points and characters I had grown to care about I was struggling to maintain my attention. Fortunately the conclusion was strong: exciting action and some really cool moments where we learned more about certain characters and their motivations (insights into Sergeant Bothari and how his messed up childhood led to the development of the demons that have plagued him throughout the series were especially compelling). Overall this was a good continuation to the series that has left me psyched to check out the rest of the series, especially as these first 2 books often felt like a prologue to the ""really start"" of the series with the appearance of Miles in book 2.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61900.Cordelia_s_Honor
Star Wars: The Truce at Bakura;Kathy Tyers;1994;1990;341;3.46;13563;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Media Tie In'];No sooner has Darth Vader's funeral pyre burned to ashes on Endor than the Alliance intercepts a call for help from a far-flung Imperial outpost. Bakura is on the edge of known space and the first to meet the Ssi-ruuk, cold-blooded reptilian invaders who, once allied with the now dead Emperor, are approaching Imperial space with only one goal: total domination. Princess Leia sees the mission as an opportunity to achieve a diplomatic victory for the Alliance. But it assumes even greater importance when a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi appears to Luke Skywalker with the message that he must go to Bakura—or risk losing everything the Rebels have fought so desperately to achieve. Even as the Alliance arrives, the aliens have almost overcome the Bakura Imperial garrison, whose desperate commander will accept help from any quarter—even Rebel—against an insidious foe that enslaves Human minds to pilot their invincible machines of war and destruction. While marshalling the tattered Imperial forces, Luke, Han Solo, and Princess Leia must win the trust and cooperation of the Bakurans. For although Imperial Governor Nereus has granted the Rebels temporary amnesty there is the possibility of treachery among those whose first allegiance lies with the Empire. On the eve of the final explosive onslaught, Rebel and Imperial forces must finally come to terms with each other…or lose the entire galaxy to the hideous servitude promised by a victorious alien enemy. Capturing the sweep and excitement of the original Star Wars saga, The Truce at Bakura plants a seed of hope for peace, sees the formation of a timeless love, and stands witness to a Jedi's undying sacrifice to defend Humanity against an alien nemesis.;"Han paused in midstep. ""What is this? I suppose you're going to ask my intentions toward your sister.""Luke smiled at Han. ""I know what your intentions are, friend. She needs you. Just don't let her down.""Han's crooked smiled shone like an asteroid beacon. ""Not on your life.""This book may be one of the best Star Wars books I have ever read. It takes place right after Return of the Jedi and demonstrates Luke, Leia, Han, and the rest of the Alliance dealing with the aftermath of having the Empire torn apart. What really impressed me however was that it also subtly dealt with smaller issues with the characters that I had always wondered about. Namely, the physical damage to Luke from the Emperor's lightning attacks and the anger/shock Leia feels while coping with the fact that Vader was her father. Also, there was brilliant and beautiful dialogue between everyone throughout the book, as well as a few really nice scenes between Han and Leia. Despite my everlasting love for the forbidden romance between Anakin and Padme, the relationship between Han and Leia will always be my favorite Star Wars couple. :) An all around wonderful book!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/302618.Star_Wars
Bellwether;Connie Willis;1996;1990;248;3.93;13174;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];Connie Willis has won more Hugo and Nebula awards than any other science fiction author. Now, with her trademark wit and inventiveness, she explores the intimate relationship between science, pop culture, and the arcane secrets of the heart.Sandra Foster studies fads - from Barbie dolls to the grunge look - how they start and what they mean. Bennett O'Reilly is a chaos theorist studying monkey group behavior. They both work for the HiTek corporation, strangers until a misdelivered package brings them together. It's a moment of synchronicity - if not serendipity - which leads them into a chaotic system of their own, complete with a million-dollar research grant, caffé latte, tattoos, and a series of unlucky coincidences that leaves Bennett monkeyless, fundless, and nearly jobless. Sandra intercedes with a flock of sheep and an idea for a joint project. (After all, what better animal to study both chaos theory and the herd mentality that so often characterizes human behavior?)But scientific discovery is rarely straightforward and never simple, and Sandra and Bennett have to endure a series of setbacks, heartbreaks, dead ends, and disasters before they find their ultimate answer...;"https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2017/...I owe bellwether a review.  Bellwether is a book that I inevitably turn to when I want something that is light, clever, literate and sweet.  Sandra Foster has been studying fads, specifically trying to identify what started the bobbed hair craze at some time in the 1920s.  The company administrative assistant, Flip, is pretty much the worst ever, and one day when she mis-delivers a 'perishable' (not 'fragile,' as Pip says) to Sandra, Sandra finds herself taking the package down to the Biology Department, where she meets Bennett O'Rielly, a chaos researcher who seems to be entirely immune to fashion fads.  What happens is a more than a bit of gradually escalating chaos as they each try to work on their respective projects, turn in the annual funding request to the Hi-Tek Corporation, dodge team-building meetings, and avoid Flip's oblivious tendencies towards destruction.Each chapter begins with a description of a fad, much like certain books begin chapters with aphorisms. I actually learned a little bit about a number of fun things, including hula hoops (1958-59), hair dioramas (1750-60) mah-jongg (1922-24). There are numerous references to scientific discoveries, fascinating if you know your scientific history. There's a mention of Fleming leaving a Petri dish cracked as he headed out to golf, and a researcher hiring a Polish woman named Marie Curie to help him with radiation research. It's one of the things that elevates this beyond your average rom-com. I'll also note there's a definite feel of verisimilitude about this; on this reading I noted Sandra referencing SPSS software, classic software that I've used myself in statistics class.  As in To Say Nothing of the Dog, there are a number of running gags, including corporate insensibility (""Tell them any number of scientific breakthroughs have been made by scientists working together. Crick and Watson, Penzias and Wilson, Gilbert and Sullivan--""), bigotry against smokers, personal ads, where rivers begin, and the unrelenting cheer of Browning's Pippa. In a nod to having a life outside of work, she weaves in her adventures at the local (trendy) cafe and her regular visits to the library.While I understand this isn't highbrow literature, it is one of those reads that make one feel delightfully entertained, resulting in a lingering feeling of happy once it's over. It's my go to read when I need something light and clever to cleanse my palate in between those nail-biters. How much do I love it? I own a hardcover... and a paperback for lending. In view of my recent review of The Trespasser, I absolutely give this five stars.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24985.Bellwether
Damia;Anne McCaffrey;1991;1990;380;4.04;13153;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Paranormal', 'Space Opera'];Of all the Rowan's children, Damia was the most brilliant and the one who inherited the Talent. It was obvious that she would be a Prime. As Damia grew up, her Talent became almost too strong to control, and the only solution was to send her to the planet of Deneb, to her strange grandmother.;"This is silly, this book isn't about Damia, it's about Afra. Which is probably the right choice as he's more interesting than she is, given he's 24 years older than she is and by the end of the book she's only 19. (Which has its own set of problems right there.)It's a middling book. But you know, I think I've realized why this series wears on me; it's quite boring to read about hyper-privileged aristocrats who are spoilt, moody, confident of their skills and power and who never interact with the riff-raff. It's palace intrigue without the actual intrigue, because no one's ever trying to kill each other off and there's no political opposition to (or check on) the FT&T monopoly. There's no struggle in their lives, only small flare-ups of drama between siblings. So the only things they expend effort on are flirting, pouting, and having children. It's maddening.The first half of the book's all Afra, the second half of the book's largely Damia, the Rowan lurks around being moody and pregnant and fussy, Raven flits in and out like the high school quarterback, adored by all. Boring! Boring boring boring. Romance novels in spaaaaaaaaace.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61959.Damia

Kevin Renner, Horace Bury, Rod Blaine and other characters introduced in THE MOTE IN GOD'S EYE must now find new ways to cope with the inevitable Motie expansion while trying to protect humanity. Sequel to the novel Robert A. Heinlein called ""Possibly the finest science fiction novel I have ever read.""";This sequel to The Mote in God's Eye is a two-time DNF for me. I like the first book so much and I kept thinking, even if the sequel's not as good, it has to be worth reading, and I really want to find out what happened with the Moties. And both times--several years apart--I got about half-way through, bogged down and quit. The storyline just got too slow and confusing and I completely lost interest.I was reasonably engaged with the first half of the story, which involves a mystery with a Mormon group on a planet that may have some clandestine dealings with the Moties, which is of grave concern to the authorities, since Moties reproduce incredibly quickly and Motie warriors = Death, walking. But somehow when the setting and conflict moved out into space it totally lost me. I like space opera and I'm usually good with space wars, so I never have figured this out. It still irks me.Maybe someday I'll give it a third shot.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218453.The_Gripping_Hand

Freedom's Landing;Anne McCaffrey;1995;1990;324;3.98;11885;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Aliens', 'Adventure'];Kristin Bjornsen lived a normal life, right up until the day the spaceships floated into view above Denver. As human slaves were herded into the maw of a massive vessel, Kristin realized her normal life was over and her fight for freedom was just beginning…The alien Catteni value strength and intelligence in their slaves—and Kristin has managed to survive her enslavement while hundreds of other humans have not. But her trial has just begun, for now she finds herself part of a massive experiment. The aliens have discovered a new world, and they have a simple way of finding out if it’s habitable: drop hundreds of slaves on the surface and see what happens.If they survive, colonization can begin. If not, there are always more slaves.;I bumped into this by accident in the library, and since McCaffrey died I’d been meaning to read something by her, and the blurb looked to be promising SF with a dash of romance I decided to take the entire series with me on Christmas break. I’m so glad I did, because I really liked this first book. It dives right in when Kris an escaped human slave on a strange planet, encounters Zainal, a Catteni (the aliens who invaded Earth and took a bunch of humans off-planet as slaves), who is on the run himself. Figuring that a common enemy makes them some sort of allies, she saves his hide, which gets her captured again and dropped on Botany, a planet version of penitary colony. Thus commences a tale of settling a new planet, organizing the humans and various kinds of other aliens, and figuring out who the original owners of the planet were.I like planet settling stories, and I’m definitely planning on reading more. There’s something about surviving under harsh circumstances that’s really interesting and intriguing. I really liked that we got to see the settling and organizing through the eyes of Kris, who isn’t a leader. She’s very capable and definitely an important member of the original droppers, but she doesn’t have a position of power.I liked how very unbigoted Kris was, and how ready to defend Zainal and the other non-humans. I loved that she kept chastising herself for her horniness. I liked the pace of the romance as well , and found it very fitting that it didn’t take the forefront for a long time.There were a lot of touches that seemed very realistic to me, like the dietary problems of the Deski’s, the few untasteful troublemakers, the threat of abuse towards women when there were only few of them. I did think that the settling seemed to go almost too easy, and that the few troubles they had didn’t seem all that unsettling. But then the fact that they are dropped with materials is part of the Catteni plot, and the fact that they aren’t the first settlers is part of the Botany plot, so at least the easiness of it all is explained.All in all I was pleasantly surprised, and definitely want to read the second installment right away. There’s about a million ways this can go, and currently all of them seem interesting.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61928.Freedom_s_Landing
Damia's Children;Anne McCaffrey;1993;1990;336;3.95;11242;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Paranormal', 'Space Opera', 'Romance'];Damia and Afra-Raven-Lyon had reared their children in a brilliant and unorthodox way. All their young had been 'paired' when six months old with the furry, one-eyed Mrdinis, the only other sentient beings in the Alliance, who could communicate with humans by their 'dream messages'. Together, Man and Mrdini worked to create prosperous worlds and guard against the terrible threat of the annihilating Hivers.And now, in the deeps of Space, Mrdini scouts had crossed the path of three Hive ships -- ships that were giant hulks of cell units, bearing the queens and workers out into space, to breed and multiply and destroy wherever they found a viable planet.It was the four elder children of Damia -- Laria, Thian, Rojer and Zara -- all uniquely talented in their various ways, who were to play their part, helped by their life-long Dini friends, in the conquering and investigation of the Alien threat of the Hivers.;A serious improvement over its predecessor.

Permutation City;Greg Egan;1994;1990;352;4.06;11229;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Philosophy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];The story of a man with a vision—immortality: for those who can afford it is found in cyberspace. Permutation City is the tale of a man with a vision—how to create immortality—and how that vision becomes something way beyond his control. Encompassing the lives and struggles of an artificial life junkie desperate to save her dying mother, a billionaire banker scarred by a terrible crime, the lovers for whom, in their timeless virtual world, love is not enough—and much more—Permutation City is filled with the sense of wonder.;Fractious FakesWhat happens when your virtual clone hates your guts? Well apparently “Panic. Regret. Analysis. Acceptance” in that order. “People reacted badly to waking up as Copies.” Well, yeah of course. It’s a bit like finding out your girlfriend is really a transgender biker - a mixture of fearful awe and fascinated interest. From a literary point of view, Egan has done something both awesome and interesting: he’s created a sort of reverse allegory. Instead of language taking on an alternative meaning from its literal referents, he has people taking on the literal qualities of language - vocabulary, grammar, and effects. You aren’t what you eat but what can be said about you, and programmed, in Permutation City.The key to Egan’s intention, I think, is in his protagonist’s muttering of a secret password, “Abulafia.” This is a reference to a medieval Kabbalist who, as Kabbalists are wont to do, turned everything into language in order to disorient those who use it -people in other words - and, paradoxically, thereby to free language-users from the insidious power of the language which is actually using them (See: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).The device of using a virtual reality ‘Copy’ within a virtual reality world - “urine and feces production optional” - is something Abulafia would have grasped immediately as obvious and necessary given the availability of the technology. This is Tohu, the Shattering of the Vessels through which the original unity of the universe is broken into fragments, both physical and spiritual. Tohu happens psychically as well for individuals. That is, bits of the Self are strewn about creation in a most unsatisfactory and unhappy state. These spiritual bits can become quite unruly in their condition of fragmented isolation. They are desperate to end their loneliness by re-integrating with the original whole. This is Tikkun, a sort of reconstruction of psychic pieces into a new entity. Paradoxically, of course, such a ‘rebirth’ also involves the ‘death’ of the fragmented Selves. If anything were to impede this process, an aberrant techno-savvy Kabbalist for example, there is an interesting story to be told.And Egan tells the story masterfully. I can only marvel at how he finds his inspiration for a high-tech tale in an ancient wisdom like Kabbalah, and then proceeds to out-Kabbalah even the Kabbalists with his creativity.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156784.Permutation_City

And it takes some concentration to read Bascule’s account of events. It’s not for the lazy reader. Banks’ ability to write awkwardly and unfamiliarly yet make it sound like a substantive, caring, and relatable person is pretty damn amazing. But like many of Banks’ novels there's more beneath the surface. Underlying Bascule’s phonetic writing is a point of much more substance, a commentary on the struggle we humans endure to communicate with one another and with the world. It’ll take me several steps to get there, so try to hang with me ... The world of Feersum Endjin contains too many details to paint them all, and the big picture itself is difficult to paint because you can’t stand back far enough to take it all in. Take, for example, the absurdly oversize castle called Serehfa in which much of the Earth’s population lives. We’re talking a castle built to scale for people who stand hundreds of meters tall. A castle with walls standing several kilometers high, the tops obscured by haze and the shear cliff-faces running to the horizon on your right and left. A central tower that tickles the underbelly of outer space. A structure set atop a three-kilometer tall mesa in one room that, seen from afar, looks like a chandelier lowered from the ceiling for spring cleaning. Seen up close, the chandelier is a city of elaborate, soaring, glass-paneled skyscrapers. A structure is set kilometers high in the corner of one room that, seen from afar, looks like a baroque decorative gargoyle. Seen up close the gargoyle is a residential complex where people enjoy the view from balconies in the eyes. The larger rooms have their own weather systems. One room contains a volcano. Others contain lakes and rivers and hills and valleys. The rooms in the higher levels—each level standing a couple kilometers tall—are perpetually cold, and one of them holds a year-round ski-resort. In what would be a castle’s dungeon, the somber port city of Oubliette (you heard that right) sits beside a black ocean that hasn’t seen sunlight in millennia. Now, stay with me here ...You can visualize parts of the castle Serehfa. Your imagination has painted pictures—perhaps even detailed pictures—of the corner of one room and the centerpiece in another, of one small piece of the horizon-spanning castle walls. Your mind is busily filling in random details plucked from your memory to create a room with a volcano, and a room with lakes and rivers, hills and valleys. You know what a ski resort looks like so your mind simply places it inside a vast interior space. But visualizing the whole castle? No. Definitely not. Just a few scattered pieces that contain sufficiently familiar elements for your mind to grab on to, like a good handhold on a cliff face. But pull back and urge your imagination to paint the entire monstrosity ... and you’re hand will miss a handhold, your foot slip from a niche, and you go tumbling right on down. Still with me? Even through the mixed metaphors? Good. Let’s take the next step ...What if the castle Serehfa was not just a physical setting for our young hero Bascule’s adventures? It’s a hell of a setting, to be sure, another example of Banks’ penchant for conceiving breathtaking, larger-than-life locales for his characters to roam. But what if Serehfa was, let’s say, a lens to focus the reader's thoughts and a pattern for those thoughts to follow ... an archetype, perhaps. Once you know how to picture Serehfa (by which I mean you’ve realized that you can’t picture Serehfa, you can only picture pieces of it), you can begin to picture how you exist in, and relate to, our contemporary human society. You're thinking that sounds ambitious, yes? A tenuous connection, maybe? Well, let’s see if I can make this idea stick ...The society in Feersum Endjin is too massive, complex, and even contradictory to pull together in a big picture that makes much sense. That society encompasses the living and the dead, the first-lifers and the reincarnated, the physical and the virtual, the human-basic and the chimeric. Those diverse brush strokes are weaved together in a multifaceted symphony of color that defies our ability to imagine. What Banks paints for us through the stories of Bascule and other individuals are the detailed sections--like the rooms in Serehfa--that our minds can conceive of. But focusing on the detailed sections prevents us from seeing the whole picture. So we try to step back. Unfortunately, stepping back causes us to lose sight of the comprehendable details, leaving a wash of generalities, and, worse, the stepping back is in vain because we never can step back far enough to take in the whole construction. Sounds like our archetype, doesn't it? Yes, you answer with a bored sigh. It's so faaaascinating, you say sarcastically as you snicker to one another. I know, I know, you’re attention span is getting shorter as this review gets longer. Don’t worry, there’s just one more step, I promise ...I maintain that our contemporary human society is not so different from the Serehfa archetype, nor from the fictional future society to which we've already applied the archetype. We may not have chimerics walking the sidewalks, or sentient AI's floating around our internets, or reincarnated people in our living rooms, but our world is no less strange or diverse in its own way; no less intricate or impossibly complex. We each can see and understand the detailed sections painted by our own stories and those around us, but when we step back, when we lose the context of the individual, we are prone to make sweeping generalities.Fine, you say between yawns, so what? What has this all got to do with Bascule and his learning disability? Okay, so there's one more step. I'm sorry about that, but here's where I try to bring it all together: The way Bascule writes is the way we relate to this world, to our ""Serehfa."" Our world is full of rules, oh so many rules, for fitting in. And like the rules of the English written language, some make sense and some don’t. Some are consistent while others are contradictory. Some rules have a logical basis while others are wholly arbitrary. So how do we survive in this vast, complex monstrosity of a world where we’ll never understand the whole picture but we can see little sections in detail and which imposes upon us multifarious rules that make no sense? We speak to it phonetically, willing people to understand us and praying people will forgive us for our lapses, trying like mad to concentrate on the phonetic mutterings emanating from our friends and loved ones so we can understand them. And all the while we’re hoping like hell that the insignificant section we paint leaves some meaning behind when we’re gone.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12015.Feersum_Endjinn

Brightness Reef;David Brin;1995;1990;661;3.91;10724;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Aliens', 'Speculative Fiction'];"Jijo es un planeta prohibido, un mundo que se recupera lentamente de un grave desastre ecológico y al que, un millón de años atrás, los Buyur condenaron a permanecer cerrado a la colonización y al contacto interestelar. Sin embargo diversos grupos de seres inteligentes, a menudo forajidos o extraviados, han aterrizado en Jijo pese a lo decretado por la civilización galáctica, y han roto de este modo su aislamiento.Jijo ha alcanzado pues en este periodo de exclusión una compleja paz social intercultural, basada en la tolerancia y el respeto mutuo entre las siete especies que lo han ido poblando: los misteriosos bípedos hoon; los qheuens, con forma de cangrejo y con cinco patas y pinzas; los urs parecidos a centauros; los g'kek, dotados de ruedas impulsadas biomagnéticamente; los traeki, con sus múltiples personalidades; los gláver, involucionados a un estado de presapiencia; y los humanos de la Tierra, de más reciente arribo, que aportan la tecnología que permite el florecimiento de una nueva civilización.Siempre bajo la amenaza del inevitable Día de Juicio, cuando las Cinco Galaxias descubran esa colonia ilegal y prohibida, acontece de repente lo imprevisto: una nave estelar aterriza cerca del lugar que los pobladores de Jijo consideran más sagrado. La mayor aventura a escala galáctica está servida.";This happens to be one of those books that is both brilliant and lacking at the same time. I will explain myself. The novel is actually quite as daunting and impressive as Startide Rising and The Uplift War in it's way, but it's mainly because Brin doesn't ever stint on world building. Ever. He goes all out and develops tons of alien races, tons of characters, and a great many implications for the amazingly complex alien culture among the 16 galaxies. Truly, I have nothing bad to say at all about the quality and depth of its development. It's actually rather staggering. Brin never rests on his laurels. He finds new avenues to drill down into and I should say that there are VERY few authors who do it as deep or consistently as he does.So what's lacking? Well that's a very complex creature, too. My primary go-to complaint is in the basic story, but it isn't because it's too simple or too complex. Rather, it's because I was constantly wondering why I should care about some far distant fallow world where a bunch of alien refugees including humans had tossed all their technology into the drink in order to hopefully devolve genetically, culturally, and intellectually. Why would they do it? Because while they're political and cultural dissidents to the rest of the galactic society, they're also adherents to a weird quasi-religious tenant that is diametrically opposed to Uplift in general. They want to return to innocence. (Of course, not everyone believes. Humans are a bit more complex and have their own reasons to buck this trend with their books and their skepticism of the galactic culture that either doesn't want to be bothered to help the upstarts, but that's a sub-plot.)I have no problem with the concept. In fact, if this was any other novel by any other author, I'd be touting it and the way it approaches the subject as honestly unique and fascinating. So what's my problem with it? I don't like book-burning. I'm in love with books. Of course, these guys take it all the way and sink their spaceships and all their tech, too, with a few human exceptions, but the core is the same.What we've got is a novel about aliens and humans interacting in very complex ways with the ever-present fear that the galactics will find them and punish them and their entire RACE for the crimes of despoiling a fallow planet that should have remained fallow and untouched by anyone for several billion more years. That's a steep punishment for a broken law. Notice, too, that the galactic culture with its many, many, many species is an establishment that has been around for a very, very long time. Nothing stays around that long without being a very robust system. Mostly it relies on just out-waiting problems. :) ...Including dissidents who are thinking in terms of devolving themselves to pre-sentience. :) Too bad that plan goes to seed. :)So what's my problem? Too slow, maybe? My expectations wanted more resolution on a huge scale instead of what amounts to a tiny backwater and backward hamlet in the middle of nowhere?Well that's my own damn problem, right? The novel is still a damn sight better than the majority of alien society novels out there by any yardstick. My problem is that I am judging it by his other brilliant Uplift novels instead of just focusing on what it does right. And it does a lot of things very right.Of course, it's also book one of a trilogy that really needs to be read together if you want any sense of closure, too, so there's that. :)And since I've read these before and I know that the end is practically a full 180 degrees from where we start now... I should have just kept faith from the start. :) So I will. I *was* of two minds about doing this re-read, but now that I've done this second read two decades after it was published, I'm now somewhat amazed and chastened that I should have worried. This is still a classic Brin.I just needed to manage my expectations. :);https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25059.Brightness_Reef
The Gap Into Conflict: The Real Story;Stephen R. Donaldson;1990;1990;241;3.71;10647;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Speculative Fiction'];"Angus Thermopyle was an ore pirate and a murderer; even the most disreputable asteroid pilots of Delta Sector stayed locked out of his way. Those who didn't ended up in the lockup - or dead. But when Thermopyle arrived at Mallory's Bar & Sleep with a gorgeous woman by his side the regulars had to take notice. Her name was Morn Hyland, and she had been a police officer - until she met up with Thermopyle.But one person in Mallorys Bar wasn't intimidated. Nick Succorso had his own reputation as a bold pirate and he had a sleek frigate fitted for deep space. Everyone knew that Thermopyle and Succorso were on a collision course. What nobody expected was how quickly it would be over - or how devastating victory would be. It was common enough example of rivalry and revenge - or so everyone thought. The REAL story was something entirely different.";This was my second attempt at reading a Stephen R. Donaldson novel. My first attempt was way back in my teens when I picked up Lord Foul's Bane. My read of the first Thomas Covenant book went so poorly that I never even finished the story. I had loved the concept and found Donaldson's writing to be fairly engaging, but I was too disgusted with the character of Thomas to continue reading his story. It was my hope that The Real Story would have more of what I liked and less of what I did not. Unfortunately that was a forlorn hope. The Real Story was incredibly dark and brutal and proved to be an uncomfortable read. Mostly due to all the abuse and rape depicted within the story. I'm actually convinced that Donaldson might have a bit of a rape fetish! The characters did not help matters as none of the three main characters were particularly likeable. The main character Angus Thermopyle was even more loathsome than Thomas Covenant. Despite a whole host of issues I did still find the actual story fairly intriguing and engaging. On the surface it is the tale of how the handsome swashbuckling pirate Nick Succorso outwits fellow pirate, and a man of dark reputation, Angus Thermopyle and in doing so saves the trapped beauty, Morn Hyland. The structure of the story was intriguing. We got the tale from the perspective of the casual observer, and then the tale from the perspective of the more discerning observer, before finally getting the real story from the POV of Angus himself. The story was one of rivalry, deception, and treachery. I found the story quite engaging. I'd likely have enjoyed the tale more if the characters had been more likeable and the content less disturbing. I'm not sure if I'll press on with the rest of the series. I can tolerate a bleak and depressing book when it is short like this one was, but the sequels are far larger in size. The slight glimmer of hope might be that the second half of the story focused less on the abuse of the captured Morn and more on the battle of wits between Angus, Nick, and Morn. Rating: 3.5 stars.Audio Note: This was narrated by Scott Brick. This story actually played to Brick's strengths as a narrator. The cast was tiny and the story was bleak so it suited Brick's wonderfully mournful sounding voice.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/427353.The_Gap_Into_Conflict
Foreigner;C.J. Cherryh;1994;1990;428;3.92;10437;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy', 'Aliens', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];The first book in C.J. Cherryh's eponymous series, Foreigner begins an epic tale of the survivors of a lost spacecraft who crash-land on a planet inhabited by a hostile, sentient alien race.From its beginnings as a human-alien story of first contact, the Foreigner series has become a true science fiction odyssey, following a civilization from the age of steam through early space flight to confrontations with other alien species in distant sectors of space. It is the masterwork of a truly remarkable author.;"Review contains fanart and images done by me. ^.^ 
Sci-fi...Let me tell you something about sci-fi books... they are scary! No, I'm not talking about movies or TV series, and yes, Astronomy was one of my favorite subject in school. But for some reason, sci-fi books are generally on a completely different level for me.I have ventured into sci-fi territory before ... And, occasionally, I would find something ""comprehensible"" enough for my fairies-and-dragons-obsessed brain.Buuuut, in most cases......I would be completely clueless of what's going on. Ahem....Anyways, one day I stumbled upon C.J.Cherryh's book – Foreigner and it appeared to be everything I ever wanted from any sci-fi OR fantasy book. The synopsis hinted at politics, intrigues, inter-racial relationship, adapting to new culture, space... stuff, overall – a potential for me to enjoy it as long as it wasn't too philosophical, too military orientated or too techno-terms heavy.~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*THE REVIEW (yep, finally)I was very cautious when I started Foreigner, but as I kept going I found myself falling in love with the potential of the series. Not only did it have great unique and fully-developed characters, an original setting, an intriguing new race with strange customs and behavior, it was just addictive. True, the first book was rather strange (I'll talk more about it later), but the possibilities were endless and I was curious to see where the characters will go!~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*SETTING AND RACES (aka. the prologue)The books starts with a quick recap of how the humans, whose ship was stranded in unknown space, ended up on their new alien planet. All you need to know is that the Humans were far more technologically advanced than the planet's inhabitants – the Atevi, who were rather perplexed to see some pale short strange-looking creatures obsessing over their flora and fauna and considering moving in.The initial amity between the newcomers and the locals didn't last for long and, a few years and MANY misunderstandings later, a war ensued between the two species. Humans, despite their superior weaponry, had no chance of winning against a race that specialized in warfare and assassination (and outnumbered them 1 to a few millions). Eventually, a peace treaty was signed by both races, allowing humans to live on the island of Mospheira on a few conditions:-Humans would share technological information with the Atevi (not too much at a time as to not cause disturbance among the more orthodox of the race)-And NO human would be allowed on the Atevi continent, except for one – the Paidhi (something like the ambassador of the human population and, most importantly, the translator).For full-resolution go HereThe ""Mospherians""were more than happy to agree and finally enjoy a peaceful and boring existence. Meanwhile, the human paidhi's role was to guarantee all demands are met and the peace treaty maintained. A task not as easy as you might think - you see, the Atevi are very strange. Assassination is legalized (in fact, the assassin's guild is one of the most respectable institution on the planet), words such as ""friend"" ""love"" ""feelings"" are absent from their vocabulary and they are also EASILY offended by the weirdest things such as 
NUMBERS!
Numbers are sacred with the Atevi – their sentences have to have felicitous (fortunate?) numbers such as 3,7 and so on, while 2, 8,etc. are Baaaaad! E.g. - if you suggest "" a pair of apples"" or your sentence has the dreaded 8 words in it, that would imply that you wish the Atevi you were speaking to bad luck or something worse. Considering how superstitious this race is, it's very likely they would kill you on the spot! That's why, the Paidhi's role is essentially DIFFICULT AS HELL!~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~PLOT (aka. the actual story)An assassination attempt is made on the life of the new young paidhi – Bren Cameron. Unlike his predecessors, he is far more open-minded and ambitious to build better relationship between the two races, which could lead to major shifts in power in Atevi society. Tabini-aiji, the leader of the biggest and most powerful association on the planet, decides Bren is useful enough to be protected, so he sends him away to his grandmother's fortress deep into the continent.Tabini's grandmother, Ilisidi, is VERY traditional and strong-minded person. She despises the human influence in the Atevi's way of life, so Bren has to be extra careful – one slip and the old lady would order his assassination in an instant. Why would Tabini send him from one dangerous place to another?As time passes by, Bren falls in love with the old-fashion way of the Atevi, but there's something troubling him...He feels like he's being tested and he has no idea why. He can't decide who is the enemy and whether any of the Atevi, or the Humans for that matter, mean him any good. And what was the purpose of the assassination attempt anyways?~*~*~*~*~My opinion I just finished book 6 at the moment, so this will be more of a general rant (without any spoilers!), but it will, hopefully, give you an idea of what the series is all about and whether it's worth investing your time. What I liked 1. The Foreigner series is easily accessible for non-hardcore sci-fi fans! You heard me right, there are no cryptic technical terms, no existential philosophy to put you to sleep, no military mumbo-jumbo and so forth. At least, not to an excessive extent.2. Characters are so well-developed that sometimes I forget they're fictional! Bren is likable and not that interesting at first, but as the series progresses, he keeps changing and evolving. His two guards, Banichi and Jago, are just as intriguing, complex and sometimes even hilarious when they try to understand human logic. A new cast of character is added as you go and they're perfect in their imperfection- just like real people.3. World-development It's quite good in the first book, but it gets massively awesome by book 6! Can't say why, or I'll spoil the series for you.4. Atevi culture There are cases where their superstitions regarding numbers is completely impractical (such as rooms that have one main entrance and two emergency fire exits, because having 3 doors is luckier number than 2) But most importantly, the Atevi are 90% unique in their ways, you can barely understand their logic at first. They're huge and violent, yet appear calm and collected, they value interior design and clothing with delicate lace, they're obsessed with etiquette and politeness and would gladly share a decorative cup of (poisonous for humans) tea with you. It's just a great original culture with its own perks that enriches C.J.Cherryh's world and I love it!5. PLOT TWIIIIIISTS GOD, there are some AMAZING, mind-blowing plot twists and especially massive ones towards the last 10% of EACH book! A couple of times I could see the twist coming, yet, the way it was presented STILL managed to blow me away!What I dislikedDespite ""Foreigner"" being in my top 10 favorite series of all time, there are still elements that do not agree with me and it's only fair that I share them as well.1. First book is the weakest. Yes, many of us have heard this before. Overall, the first book serves as a semi-introduction to C.J.Cherryh's world and politics and it can be slightly underwhelming, with barely anything important happening for a long period of time. Especially if you're expecting space battles and so on (oh, they're coming, just not in book 1)2. The pacing varies, some times it's brilliant, fast, exciting, while other times it can be slow and repetitive.  Spending a good amount of time in Bren's head and listening to him over-analyzing and going through a situation for 10 times until he comes up with an awesome idea can be slightly boring. Nevertheless, these moments don't last for long! (except maybe in the first book...sorry)3. There's a definite lack of great young female human characters(20-40 years old). Yes, the old ladies are awesome, the Atevi female characters are even more awesome, but when it comes to the young female characters ... 4. And lastly, the majority of the humans very often behave like a very ignorant nation without any culture or appreciation for history (at least up to book 6 so far). Some times, they even feel more alien than the Atevi (*says a person who spent a whole summer in the Louvre, starring at vases, mummies and paintings of semi-naked people*). Also, the humans in the book can be VERY self-centered and politically illiterate. Their general stupidity annoys me, which makes it kind of hard to root for them ^___^ConclusionWill I recommend this book to friends? If you're looking for a light, jolly book with juicy romance and predictable plot – look elsewhere, I'm afraid. Foreigner is a sci-fi series that's just ... unique in its own way: 1.it's not action-packed at first, although the battles get more and more epic as you go!2.it's not filled with existential questions that will make you contemplate life, but it does explore human nature and our ability to adapt and accept diversity and challenges as they come.3.it's not an easy series to get into, but it's damn right worth trying... :3";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57043.Foreigner
Diaspora;Greg Egan;1997;1990;443;4.11;9927;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Novels'];"By the end of the 30th century humanity has the capability to travel the universe, to journey beyond earth and beyond the confines of the vulnerable human frame.The descendants of centuries of scientific, cultural and physical development divide into fleshers — true Homo sapiens; Gleisner robots — embodying human minds within machines that interact with the physical world; and polises — supercomputers teeming with intelligent software, containing the direct copies of billions of human personalities now existing only in the virtual reality of the polis.Diaspora is the story of Yatima — a polis being created from random mutations of the Konishi polis base mind seed — and of humankind, Of an astrophysical accident that spurs the thousandfold cloning of the polises. Of the discovery of an alien race and of a kink in time that means humanity — whatever form it takes — will never again be threatened by acts of God.";The Revised Book of GenesisAs is usual with everything by Egan, Diaspora is so densely packed with ideas that all summaries are inadequate. Only one comparison seems even remotely appropriate - to the biblical Book of Genesis.Diaspora is a history of the re-creation of the universe, one in which there is no need for divine power to either start it off or continue its development. In fact, this is a history of how the defects and design flaws of the original creation story are corrected by hard experience. One of those flaws, perhaps the most destructive, is the vulnerability of the universe to arbitrary and uninformed divine intervention.Egan lays out a blueprint for how a very different form of life than has been previously known comes into existence. Moving from the self-referential algorithms necessary to produce consciousness, to the algorithms of transformational topology necessary to impose that consciousness on the world coherently, he provides step by step instructions for the evolution of primitive pyschoblasts, embryonic minds as pure bits of energy, into citizens of the polis, an entirely electronic civilisation.Such citizens are free to explore the Truth Mines containing not just the records of human experience, but the mathematical implications of that experience ‘experienced’ by its fellow-citizens. Through collective reasoning the polis has recognised that reliance on pure deduction is dangerous. It can lead to disaster, particularly that of exponential growth, as previous generations of the original creation had discovered on numerous occasions.In other words there are limits to strictly mathematical reasoning: “The only way to grasp a mathematical concept was to see it in a multitude of different contexts, think through dozens of specific examples, and find at least two or three metaphors to power intuitive speculations... Understanding an idea meant entangling it so thoroughly with all the other symbols in your mind that it changed the way you thought about everything.” This is the function of art. Not just as a means of tempering mathematical logic, but as a way to find undiscovered truths - about ourselves as well as the rest of the universe.The new creation of the polis has also learned how to interact with the old creation of flesh and blood. It can embody itself in robotic form and engage in productive discussion and planning with those unfortunate beings, us, who are the result of the original botched creation-attempt. Although Egan doesn’t claim it explicitly, this is functionally a new religion, one of the self-creation of the world and our total responsibility for it. A remarkable new theology generated from primordial circuitry.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156785.Diaspora

His journey is a mission to find Curious Yellow, the ultimate, perhaps even mythical Vurt feather. As the most powerful narcotic of all, Scribble must be prepared to leave his current reality behind. This edition also includes three additional short stories by Noon.;Getting what one desperately needs has hardly ever been such a mind boggling, confusing, psychedelic trip.Drugs are amazing plot devices and how Noon plays with the idea in a minimalistic setting, just using strange protagonists with weird ideologies keen on getting hooked on as hard and extreme as possible, possibly reflecting about stuff I don´t know or care about, and generally creating a disturbing and somewhat meta work that has no similar literary equivalent, it´s just so strange that one doesn´t really know what to think about this piece after finishing it.Did one miss something, shouldn´t there be much more explanation with exposition and worldbuilding, is this just high brow blown up entertainment or something really deep? I don´t know, I can´t say, because it´s written in a way that makes it impossible to make certain and definitive evaluations of the quality, I just can´t judge if I don´t know and that hardly ever happens. Cough arrogant Austrian cough It´s definitively not that beat poet, beatnik generation road trip garbage, far better, because one notices the competence of the author who is, if his biography is correct, more high on literature than mind altering hallucinogens, but again, what is it? I guess everyone has to find out on her/his own and it would interest me if the bad rating of some of his other works are because of the complexity of what he writes or because he finally came too close to fantastic realism and poisoned his art like many before him.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17401136-vurt

Now, as faster-than-light drive opens the stars to exploration, humans are finding other relics of the race they call the Monument-Makers - each different, and each heartbreakingly beautiful. But except for a set of footprints on Jupiter's moon Iapetus, there is no trace of the enigmatic race that has left them behind. Then a team of scientists working on a dead world discover an ominous new image of the Monument-Makers. Somehow it all fits with other lost civilizations, and possibly with Earth's own future. And distant past. But Earth itself is on the brink of ecological disaster - there is no time to search for answers. Even to a question that may hold the key to survival for the entire human race...;McDevitt’s first Priscilla Hutchins novel is a sturdy, nicely paced archeological mystery. Scattered throughout the galaxy are alien relics left behind by beings known only as the Monument Makers, and the secret of their origin may herald a terrifying future disaster for mankind.Personal relationships are not McDevitt’s forte, as his clumsy handling of Priscilla’s romantic life can attest.

Puis le récit évoque la période qui a précédé, avec les oppositions, les conflits, les difficultés du recrutement des membres de la future expédition...Alliant les références rigoureuses sur la planète – l'auteur est conseiller de la NASA – à une psychologie des personnages soignée (on s'attache à suivre le parcours de Jamie, le géologue navajo, qui joue un rôle majeur), Bova parvient à donner un effet de réel qui constitue une bonne part de l'intérêt du récit.Roman classique, voire traditionnel, Mars plaira à tous ceux que l'exploration spatiale passionne et qui apprécient qu'on leur raconte avec efficacité une bonne histoire.;"Bullet Review:What an utter disappointment. Childhood Me is sitting in a corner, sobbing. Adult Me is just totally amused at how such an interesting concept can go so wrong in so many different ways.For people who think all scifi sucks, that it's just a bunch of robots wandering around technobabbling and being hideously racist and sexist, this is not going to make any new believers.2 stars, and all those stars are for the scenes on Mars that deal with MARS not the automatons masquerading as explorers.You better'd BELIEVE this will have a full review - I've owned the paperback copy for over 4 years and have dreamed of landing on Mars for over a decade.Full Review: Jaime Waterman is half-Navajo and full renowned geologist heading as one of a dozen explorers to Mars. The international team lands on Mars, explores, makes way for Jaime ""Marty Stu"" to call all the shots, comes down with a STUPID disease, and then gets stuck in a crater - perfect for Jaime Stu to come and save the day. My childhood dream was to go to Mars. I dreamed that I would be an engineer on a first Mars mission (I think my goal was to have landed THIS YEAR). I came up with my first words for my first landing, imagined who my teammates would be, planned out what foreign language I would learn (Russian, of course)...And then I grew up and realized that things change when you grow up. There is a part of me that would still LOVE to be the first to step foot on Mars, but given the decimation of the US Space Program, that dream is even further into the future. This is what I used to dream. So as a last vestige of the wide-eyed, imaginative girl that I once was, I bought this book. A friend recommended it as well, so I bumped it up the list. And then I nabbed an audiobook at the library and squeezed it into my packed reading schedule. Let's imagine this graphically, shall we? I have compiled a TOTALLY LEGIT and SCIENTIFICALLY OBJECTIVE graph for this experiment:  Let T= Percentage through Book, R=Embarrassing Racism, X=Sexualization of every female, and S=Stupidity. Then if f(T)=E=Excitement for book, the formula is approximately: f(T)=E=2*Pi*(2R+X+S)^(2T)+T Or in words: ""I hate Crystal Starr Light and want her to lose her effing mind!"" This book embraces most of the stereotypes people get when they think of science fiction in general, hard science fiction specifically. Racism? Check.Sexist characters? Check.Robot characters? Check.Male character who can do no wrong and always gets his way? Check.Science and technology for science and technology's state? Check.Politicians are BAD, science is GOOD? Check.Strawmen politicians and reporters for the scientists to show how science is good? Check. About the only thing it is missing is Little Green Men parading into the picture - but this is HARD scifi, not that wimpy soft stuff that has woowoo science and humanoid aliens. I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this book. And I DID love it when Bova shut up about his awful, stupid characters, their awful, stupid drama and looked at the science and world of Mars. GREAT stuff, completely captivating. But if to get to that stuff it means I have to spend even an HOUR listening to Jaime call himself a ""Red Man"" or laugh about the ""privilege"" being a Native American gives him or comment on how childish Joanna looks all the while wanting to seriously bone her - UMKAY, I'm getting OFF this bus KTHXBAI. Where Bova fails is the characters. They are weak, badly written, and dull. From Jaime Waterman to Ilona to Tony Reed to the Russian astronauts with difficult to spell last names (SORRY PEEPS, I listened on audiobook and have no ear for spelling out American names, much less Russian ones), all the characters are about as interesting as...hmmm, I would say a Martian rock, but those suckers are fascinating. How about coffee grounds? They have one note, one character and that's it. And what's worse, when Bova attempts to create diversity, much headbanging ensues. I would applaud his non-white characters, his attempt to include women if they weren't SO BLAND! If they actually FELT like non-white, non-American characters, instead of whiteboards painted with green and yellow and orange paint! If the women weren't all grouped into whores or madonnas. And Jaime - God, I hate Jaime. He's our protagonist, which means everything he does is perfect and wonderful. He thinks there is something to be discovered in the Grand Canyon of Mars? The WHOLE MISSION PLAN must be changed so they can investigate - who cares if Patel has other plans that he has spent DECADES on, nope, gotta follow Jaime's intuition! Jaime can sleep with Ilona, but Eddie sleeping around, even though they aren't in a committed relationship? WHORE! The other grating part of the story is the ludicrous ""Mars virus"" that the crew catches.HINT: It's not a virus.Another hint: The meteor shower that happens earlier in the book is the cause of this ""virus"" - a twist that MIGHT have been clever had the disease NOT been one that takes at least 3 months to actually show signs! And even then, it's nowhere near as deathly as is shown in the book! As for the plot: well, it's dated. A bunch of late 80's/early 90's politics crammed into a scifi book. It was mildly amusing in places, but not very believable or well-done. After awhile, I just wanted it to be OVER. And of course, the only female high-ranking official is a cutthroat b!tch. (I wouldn't have a problem with this if there was more than one female politician - women can be b!tches too after all!) This was narrated by Stefan Rudnicki, who had read the ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" that I was greatly underwhelmed with. The good news is that he didn't completely bore me with this book as he had with the previous (Obviously I don't care for Bradbury in audiobook form). The bad news is, his accents are silly, and in one case, he gives a character a Russian accent when the text EXPLICITLY STATES that that character had no discernible accent. FAIL. Still, he does have a soothing voice, and it's not completely grating to listen to. What is most disappointing is just how mediocre this book is. From a science standpoint, everything is sound and very probable. (Now politically, I sincerely doubt the crew would look this multi-national, but that's just me.) The subject is fascinating. It's the characters and plot that just flounder and flail. Boring. Racist. Sexist. Badly written. I will not be returning to Mars or any other planetary location with Ben Bova anytime in the future.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/267282.Mars

In the year 2110 technology has cured most of our worries. But even as humankind enters a new golden age, an amateur astronomer points his telescope at just the right corner of the night sky and sees disaster hurtling toward Earth: a chunk of rock that could annihilate civilization. While a few fanatics welcome the apocalyptic destruction as a sign from God, the greatest scientific minds of Earth desperately search for a way to avoid the inevitable.

Clarke – one of the “BIG THREE” golden era hard science fiction writers, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Isaac Asimov – was still writing fresh and relevant, and scientifically exciting books in the 90s, almost 50 years after he began writing stories.The Hammer of God, first published in 1993 (following the publication of a short story setting out the essential framework of the idea) demonstrates Clarke’s far ranging scientific vision for the genre. While the idea that an asteroid or a comet could slam into the Earth and cause catastrophe had been explored before (Larry Niven’s Lucifer's Hammer had been published in 1977) Clarke developed the idea that a team of Earth’s scientists and engineers could do something about it.Set in the future, life on Earth had approached utopia with the advent of scientific and technological breakthroughs that solved most of our Childhood problems. But when astronomers discovered a relatively small asteroid – given the name Kali – that was on a destruction course for Earth, plans were set into motion to save our planet.Stephen Spielberg bought the film rights to this book and with some significant changes, that production led to the 1998 film Deep Impact. Coincidentally, or interesting depending on Hollywood insider standards, The Michael Bay film Armageddon also came out in 1998.Never content to just deal in the grand idea, Clarke also explores social, political and theological changes that have occurred in this future and how those settings further impact the plot.Characterization is an element of a Clarke novel that never seems to get sufficient lift off and this trend continues here, but on the flip side, Clarke has no problem jumping millennia, centuries or decades to connect the dots and that is fun too.Good reading.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35813.The_Hammer_of_God
Infinity's Shore;David Brin;1996;1990;644;3.98;8723;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Aliens', 'Speculative Fiction'];For the fugitive settlers of Jijo, it is truly the beginning of the end. As starships fill the skies, the threat of genocide hangs over the planet that once peacefully sheltered six bands of sapient beings. Now the human settlers of Jijo and their alien neighbors must make heroic—and terrifying—choices. A scientist must turn against the benefactors she's been trained to love. A heretic must rally believers for a cause he never shared. And four youngsters find that what started as a simple adventure—imitating exploits in Earthling books by Verne and Twain—leads them to the dark abyss of mystery. Meanwhile, the Streaker, with her fugitive dolphin crew, arrives at last on Jijo in a desperate search for refuge. Yet what the crew finds instead is a secret hidden since the galaxies first spawned intelligence—a secret that could mean salvation for the planet and its inhabitants … or their ultimate annihilation.;"All that might have impressed him once – the idea of vessels millions of years old. But now he knew a truth about these ancient hulks.You want old. I’ve seen old.I’ve seen ships that make most stars seem young.There’s considerable heft to Brin’s Uplift Universe, especially in a genre consisting of big concepts and hypothetical histories. Concepts surrounding the Galactics and the protocols for Uplift feel very concrete, or substantial. It doesn’t necessary feel like you are reading Science Fiction here (even though it obviously is exactly that); a paradox that is difficult to put words to. Is it because of the intimacy of his novels? The focus isn’t always on the big event, but rather on characters who may, or may not, know what their contributions are in the bigger scheme of unfolding events. Even so, this is pretty much high concept Science Fiction, and Brin doesn’t quite let you forget that the stakes are enormously high, and that the universe is enormously large.Time would barely touch them until this fallow galaxy and its myriad star systems were awarded to new legal tenants, and the spiral arms once more teemed with commerce.Infinity’s Shore features a bewildering array of point-of-view characters. In addition to characters carried over from Brightness Reef there are also characters carried over from Startide Rising. There is a convergence of storylines at this point, tying the Uplift Storm trilogy to the earlier Uplift novels, as we edge closer to Heaven's Reach which is the final Uplift novel.No one can doubt that mysterious forces do exist – ancient, aloof, influential. Might we have crossed fates with some cryptic power, here in an abandoned galaxy, far from home?What will be the final fate of Earthclan? I don’t want to go into the whole rigmarole of Uplift, patrons and wolflings at this point, suffice to say that Earthclan appears to be only surviving by craftiness, determination and pure luck so far. Juxtaposed against this, the hubris of the Galactics.It seems that chance, or fate, or more pertinently Lady Luck, favours Earthclan. We are caught in the slowly grinding gears of a machine more vast than we imagined.[]Sometimes I think humanity would have been better off just staying in bed.It’s almost impossible to review Infinity’s Shore in isolation. It’s a wonderful book, but a big part of that is context. The Uplift series is a stone cold classic for good reason. High drama on both galactic and intimate scale. The concept of Uplift in itself also lends itself to some philosophical waxing that never seems out of place.His mind filled with an image of poignant, awful beauty. A tapestry spanning thousands of years – human history seen from afar. A tale of frightened orphans, floundering in ignorance. Of creatures smart enough to stare in wonder at the stars, asking questions of a night that never answered, except with terrifying silence.Yet again, an easy five stars. The only criticism I could level at Infinity’s Shore is that it ends on a doozy of a cliffhanger. A good thing then that I already have a copy of Heaven’s Reach.Yet he found his heart torn by the tragic story of Homo Sapiens, the self-taught wolflings of Terra. It was a bittersweet tale, pulling from his reluctant eyes trickles of tart brine that tasted like the sea.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96475.Infinity_s_Shore
Beggars in Spain;Nancy Kress;1993;1990;400;3.93;8591;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];In this future, some people need no sleep at all. Leisha Camden was genetically modified at birth to require no sleep, and her normal twin Alice is the control. Problems and envy between the sisters mirror those in the larger world, as society struggles to adjust to a growing pool of people who not only have 30 percent more time to work and study than normal humans, but are also highly intelligent and in perfect health. The Sleepless gradually outgrow their welcome on Earth, and their children escape to an orbiting space station to set up their own society. But Leisha and a few others remain behind, preaching acceptance for all humans, Sleepless and Sleeper alike. With the conspiracy and revenge that unwinds, the world needs a little preaching on tolerance.;"I love to sleep. I prefer at least eight, preferably nine hours of sleep each night. Going to bed at midnight and waking up at nine in the morning is a perk of my madcap, Bohemian university student lifestyle that I will have to abandon once I become a stern, starched-collar high school teacher. For now, however, I like my sleep, and I will defend to the death my right to snore it. But if I did not need to sleep—had, in fact, grown up without ever knowing sleep—would I miss it? How would I be different? What if I weren't alone?Beggars in Spain has a simple premise—that certain children have been genetically-engineered so that they do not sleep—with enormous implications (such as the Sleepless not aging). Once again, Nancy Kress uses genetic engineering to explore what it means to be human and how our society treats those who are different. I recognize her familiar themes from 
Nothing Human
 and ""Act One"". Kress is an awesome author of serious gene-manipulation fiction, by which I mean she doesn't use genetic engineering just as a science-fiction plot device or a background phenomenon, as one might see in other books where other motifs are more important. Whether she is altering the entire human genome, as in Nothing Human, or tweaking just a single trait, as she did here and in ""Act One,"" Kress considers the implications of her changes in how these altered humans think and behave. More importantly, she considers how the un-altered will react. And Kress is writing posthuman fiction set not in the far-off future but in the present and in the near-future; she is writing about what our lives might be like in a decade or three.So why did I have so much trouble with Beggars in Spain? I was constantly aware of how far through the book I was, and I never had that urge to continue reading like I do with books that really grip me. To be fair, I think I had a similar reaction to Nothing Human. Kress' writing style and my reading habits do not exist in perfect harmony, and sometimes that happens, even with authors whose work I admire on an intellectual or literary level. There must be more to it than that. Otherwise, I would feel comfortable giving this book five stars.Beggars in Spain has an excellent premise, but its plot is unsustainable. The tragedy is that the overall story makes a lot of sense, and it should work: the Sleepless outperform the Sleepers, who channel their fear of difference into hatred and bigotry. So far, so good: none of this requires suspension of disbelief, at all, because it's a true story that has been repeated far too often in our history. It's still happening today. Groups fear those who are different, and then the fear turns to hate, people get stupid, and individuals die. I don't begrudge Kress the parallels. Intention is one thing, however, and execution is quite another.The first part of the book, essentially what got published as a novella (and won both the Hugo and Nebula for it!), is great. I have few complaints about it. The supporting characters are somewhat thin, and the family situation is somewhat clichéd. Aside from that, however, Kress nicely portrays an American society struggling to deal with the rising population of Sleepless among them. The nascent internal divisions among the network of Sleepless is intriguing, and Kress follows up on this in the rest of the book.There are two problems with the rest of the book, and their names are Leisha Cambden and Jennifer Sharifi. Leisha is the main character, theoretically the protagonist, though she does not do much protagonizing. Although seeing the world through Leisha's Sleepless yet compassionate eyes is interesting, Leisha as a person is rather dull and credulous. She talks a lot about Yagaiism and contracts and eponymous Spanish beggars, and once in a while she kidnaps abused Sleepless children. Most of her actions, however, like the creation of the Susan Bell Foundation, take place offstage. Plenty of characters around Leisha—Richard, Alice, Jordan, Drew—are doing things; Leisha just seems to sit around lamenting the fact that people are short-sighted and judgemental. She's a bit of a downer.Jennifer Sharifi, on the other hand, is much more interesting but, again, doesn't quite work as a character. One of the two characters who come as close to antagonists as this book has, Jennifer is an ultra-cool Sleepless who pursues rationality and pragmatism to the point of irrationality. She is convinced the only route for Sleepless survival is voluntary exile: first to an orbital habitat, then out into space completely. All her energy is directed toward these efforts, laying the groundwork for the secession of the Sleepless Sanctuary from the United States. She continues to tinker with the genes of Sanctuary's children, creating a new generation of ""Supers,"" Sleepless whose neurological functions are hyper-accelerated—at the price of a loss of motor control that manifests as twitches and stuttering. Oh, and she stacks Sanctuary's ruling council with her own family members and viciously suppresses any dissent.Jennifer is a caricature of an ultra-reactionary leader of the persecuted. She's too bad, closer to a moustached villain than a devious leader fighting for the survival of the Sleepless. There's never a question of whether she has crossed a line; she has crossed it, and for that she receives no sympathy for me. I don't view her as a credible threat or challenge, because the other characters will always have the moral high ground over her. If she had been more ambiguous, or at least more formidable, I might have enjoyed her role as an antagonist more.The other antagonist comes rather late to the party. He frames Sleepless for attacks on Sleepers, including a Sleeper scientist who approaches Leisha to have develop a way of turning Sleepers into Sleepless. He's a much less important figure than Jennifer, of course, so accordingly he has less depth. Still, his involvement in the scientist's murder wasn't exactly my favourite revelation of the book. I don't really hold it against him, but he does highlight a vacancy in the roster: Leisha et al needed a true ally, a powerful Sleeper who nevertheless championed the cause of the Sleepless.I quite liked the Supers, and Miri, and their struggle as a faction within the Sanctuary faction. The whole Other-within-the-Other motif is appealing, and Miri is one of the easiest characters with whom I could sympathize. Watching her struggle with her feelings for Tony, her own brother, and reconcile the knowledge that her mother could not look upon her with love, was close to heartbreaking. And of course, Miri and the Supers are exactly Jennifer's mistake: she tries to create an ultra-superhuman being, something beyond even her own generation of Sleepless, but she haughtily thinks she can somehow control them. While the Supers' sundering of their Sanctuary shackles was predictable, it was also the most entertaining and riveting part of the book.Beggars in Spain isn't bad, but it is heavyhanded almost across the board: characters, philosophy, and plot could all have done with a much lighter touch. Just thinking of all the times the characters referred to ""beggars"" or ""beggars in Spain,"" as if Kress was not confident we would make the connection between the philosophy and the book's title, makes me wince. I appreciate subtlety, and I notice its absence. While seldom enough to ruin a book for me—especially one as admittedly thoughtful and intriguing as this—it does detract from my enjoyment. Books are my drug of choice, and Beggars in Spain left me unsatisfied.My Reviews of the Sleepless trilogy:Beggars and Choosers →";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68333.Beggars_in_Spain
Earth;David Brin;1990;1990;704;3.92;7982;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Environment', 'Near Future', 'Fantasy'];TIME IS RUNNING OUT Decades from now, an artificial black hole has fallen into the Earth's core. As scientists frantically work to prevent the ultimate disaster, they discover that the entire planet could be destroyed within a year. But while they look for an answer, some claim that the only way to save Earth is to let its human inhabitants become extinct: to reset the evolutionary clock and start over.;"This is not an easy read in spite of the well written, accessible prose, some good characterization, and some exciting scenes. The difficulty is due to the ambitious scope of the book which seems to necessitate numerous plot strands, myriad characters, and frequent expositions and infodumps. Personally I am not wired for reading nonfiction, I am always grateful to novelists who manage to impart some new knowledge to me packaged in their fiction. Indeed, I am also grateful to David Brin for the bits of knowledge I picked up from this book about astronomy, homeostasis, biology and such. Unfortunately during the first half of this book I had the feeling that entertainment is not a priority for Brin in the composition of this book, I am not even sure it is of secondary importance. Halfway through the book I was frankly a little bored and took a break to read some other books and I resumed reading it a week later. I did not want to abandon it all together because the major plot strand is very interesting (and I paid full price for the book!). I am glad I persevered because the second half of the book makes it all worthwhile.Set in 2038 (written in 1990) the basic plot of Earth is about a man-made tiny little black hole that is accidentally dropped into the Earth and begins to devour the planet from the inside atom by atom; left unchecked there would eventually be nothing left of our planet. A team of scientists go after this little runaway black hole and make some startling discoveries in the process. The lost little black hole is an attempt to create a cheap new source of energy, as human civilization is in a state of general dystopia approaching the point of apocalyptic collapse. The maximum sustainable human population has been passed and food is scarce, and the cities are polluted. This is a world Brin is cautioning us away from.While the book grew on me, exponentially in the second half, I think it could have benefited from being about 200 pages shorter. I feel that it would have been much tighter and better paced and easier to read. More often than not my eyes start to glaze over when I read the exposition passages, but in all fairness to Brin I think he explains the science better than most sci-fi writers that I have read, unfortunately, there is just a little too much of it here for me. Brin clearly cares very much about the environmental issues he raised in this book, almost to the detriment of the story. However, he is a gifted storyteller, and he does write good prose and dialogue. The central characters in the book are quite well developed and believable, but there are just too many of them. The narrative is based on multiple viewpoints as expected, but it caused the early part of the novel to feel fragmented, particularly as some of the point of view characters do not seem to be of much consequence in the grand scheme of things. Brin does bring most of the strands together by the end though, and the explosive (not to mention implosive) climax is quite thrilling. While I don't believe that it is the job of science fiction to predict the future, Earth is successfully prophetic on several counts; the advent of the worldwide web, e-mails, spams, web forums, citizen reporters, global warming and rising sea levels etc. Hopefully, the imminent collapse of the planet's environment won't be one of them, but then that is Brin's main motivation for writing the book I think.At the end of the day, I would just about rate this book at 4 stars, probably something like 3.8 or some similarly silly decimals. Worth a read if you have the time and patience. My next Brin book will be from his famed Uplift saga.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96471.Earth

If you are a fan of the Forever War, definitely don't read this book. The plot of the last 30 pages comes out of nowhere, explains nothing, and is absolutely terrible. There was no reason to set it in the universe of The Forever War, and as far as I am concerned, this book was so bad it retroactively made The Forever War worse.There is no reason to bother.

Time;Stephen Baxter;1999;1990;480;3.79;7779;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Space'];The year is 2010. More than a century of ecological damage, industrial and technological expansion, and unchecked population growth has left the Earth on the brink of devastation. As the world’s governments turn inward, one man dares to envision a bolder, brighter future. That man, Reid Malenfant, has a very different solution to the problems plaguing the planet: the exploration and colonization of space. Now Malenfant gambles the very existence of time on a single desperate throw of the dice. Battling national sabotage and international outcry, as apocalyptic riots sweep the globe, he builds a spacecraft and launches it into deep space. The odds are a trillion to one against him. Or are they?;"Squuuuiiiidddsss innnnnn sppppaaacceeeee….I enjoyed attending Stephen Baxter's class…wait, this was a novel?? Manifold: Time is the epitome of a Baxter three-star effort: some mind-bending ideas about the cosmos, a plot, some classroom lessons, some bad exposition of facts and some cardboard characters. That being said, I have enjoyed three of the four Baxter novels I've read to date, including this one.In true Baxter style, Manifold is a canvas for awesome cosmological theories and implications. I re-read passages to understand the scope. It was very cool in that respect. However, the characters are forgettable and are basically mouthpieces for the physics lessons. Also, and unfortunately, most of Baxter's books are lessons in how not to handle exposition in a story. Good exposition gives us information in the flow of the story. We don't even know it's being done. We're just being introduced to the author's world and ideas…naturally. Baxter kind of gives up and just uses a smart character to explain things to a less smart character, who is a proxy for the likely even less smart reader. Manifold: Time covers the Doomsday argument, Fermi paradox, genetic engineering, and humanity's extinction. I occasionally read non-fiction that discusses these types of ideas, and I'm sure I could perhaps find better sources to base myself on, but I have a day job and I like fiction. So, as a rule, and to a limited extent, I forgive Mr. Baxter's failure to use good exposition and characterization. Whatever, it's fun. The fact that a ragtag plot holds some of the information together is fine. Just be prepared to read with your eyes constantly rolling due to how you're being fed the information. In this first book in the Manifold series, entrepreneur Reid Malenfant has an idea to exploit an asteroid for space travel when he's convinced by a weirdo to communicate with future humans to figure out how to outsmart humanity's doomed destiny. There's Big Dumb Objects, statistics, time travel, black hole energy harvesting, and squids. In space.A particular beef: this book introduced me to the concept of the ""Carter catastrophe"". In looking it up during and after the book, I'm pretty sure that Baxter could have described it a little better. When I read the probabilistic doomsday prediction in Manifold, it felt very flawed to me, and I couldn't let that go. I'm no mathlete but it was kind of the lynchpin to the whole story and I wasn't buying it. I also did not buy how quickly Malenfant accepts the theory wholesale.I love being exposed to these kinds of ideas, so I will continue to read Baxter. In particular, I am fascinated by the Fermi paradox (the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for, or contact with, such civilizations) and its solutions. I understand this is dealt with more in the sequel, Manifold: Space. I'll read that…and likely give it three stars and copy, paste, and only mildly edit this current review.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63742.Time
Moving Mars;Greg Bear;1993;1990;448;3.85;7648;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Cyberpunk'];"Moving Mars is a story of human courage and love set within the greater saga of a planetary liberation movement. Mars is a colonial world, governed by corporate interests on Earth. The citizens of Mars are hardworking, but held back by their lack of access to the best education, and the desire of the Earthly powers to keep the best new inventions for themselves. The young Martians -- the second and third generations born on Mars -- have little loyalty to Earth, and a strong belief that their planet can be independent. The revolution begins slowly, but will grow in power over decades of political struggle until it becomes irresistible.
 
Told through the eyes of an extraordinary character, Casseia Majumdar, a daughter of one of Mars' oldest, most conservative Binding Multiples, Moving Mars is Greg Bear's brilliant conception of the human colonization of the red planet, with lovingly painted details and a grand historical sweep, embellishing an audacious scientific speculation.";I kind of can't believe this book was nominated for a Hugo. I mean, Greg Bear is often a very good writer, and I've enjoyed previous books of his. Not this one, though.

Heaven's Reach;David Brin;1998;1990;557;3.97;7066;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Aliens'];Winner of the Nebula and Hugo Awards, David Brin brings his bestselling Uplift series to a magnificent conclusion with his most imaginative and powerful novel to date--the shattering epic of a universe poised on the brink of revelation...or annihilation.The brutal enemy that has relentlessly pursued them for centuries has arrived. Now the fugitive settlers of Jijo--both human and alien--brace for a final confrontation. The Jijoans' only hope is the Earthship Streaker, crewed by uplifted dolphins and commanded by an untested human.Yet more than just the fate of Jijo hangs in the balance. For Streaker carries a cargo of ancient artifacts that may unlock the secret of those who first brought intelligent life to the Galaxies. Many believe a dire prophecy has come to pass: an age of terrifying changes that could end Galactic civilization.As dozens of white dwarf stars stand ready to explode, the survival of sentient life in the universe rests on the most improbable dream of all--that age-old antagonists of different races can at last recognize the unity of all consciousness.;"(In my best Majel Barrett voice.) Last time, on my review of the Uplift Storm Trilogy…… Alvin et al were rescued from their wrecked diving bell by none other than the submerged crew of the Streaker.… a Jophur starship landed on Jijo, capturing the Rothen ship and promising a slow, painful annihilation if the Jijoans did not divulge the location of the Streaker (if they did, the Jophur promised a swift annihilation).… to combat the Jophur threat and make good its escape, Streaker embarks on what appears to be a suicide mission to get to the hyperspace transfer point beyond Jijo's sun.Fortunately, something unexpected occurs: Zang (hydrogen-breathing life forms) and machine harvesters show up to grab carbon from Jijo's sun, and this provides the distraction Streaker needs. Thanks to the glavers Gillian took aboard from Jijo, they have a rudimentary means of flagging down the Zang and hitching a ride under the Zang's dubious protection. When they emerge from hyperspace, the Jophur ship in hot pursuit, they find themselves back at the Fractal World, a sort of ""retirement home"" for galactic species that no longer want to engage with wider civilization. Oh, and it's where Emerson got his brain cut up and where Hannes Suessi became a cyborg. Good times.And now, the conclusion.Heaven's Reach is simultaneously the best and worst book of the Uplift series, no question about it. Few authors have managed to frustrate and elate me at the same time as David Brin. This book continues the drama and tension that pervaded Infinity's Shore, and always it is building toward what will hopefully be a final, awesome climax. And though ""final"" and ""awesome"" both have a place in this climax, it's just not quite what I wanted from this series. Moreover, with Heaven's Reach, Brin seems to fall back into his old bad habits (or else those same habits were present in Infinity's Shore, but the story was good enough to blind me to them).Once again, we have a myriad of perspectives from all these different characters, and it can be difficult to grow attached to any one of them. In particular, Dwer and Rety's story as refugee sooners was fascinating but given such little time to develop. Rety, who struck me as an annoying but deep character, is little more than a petulant child in this book; Dwer gets to be a babysitter. I was anxious to hear how Streaker fared, but I was always thinking about these two as well. Still, Brin does give them the honour of being the only Jijoans who actually get to return home, so that's something.No, what really frustrates me is that after teasing us for five books and spreading the mystery so thinly, Brin concludes with a book that packs in enough exposition for an entirely new trilogy. Suddenly, concepts that had never really mattered before (e.g., the various orders of life, the levels of hyperspace) took front and centre stage, fast enough to make one's head spin. Wait, hyperspace is tearing? Wait, the Transcendent order of life is manipulating everything? These are all great revelations, great plot points, but there is just so much in Heaven's Reach. I feel like a parched man who was trapped in the desert for five books and has suddenly been thrust into the ocean, without a life preserver. We've gone from too little to too much.Amid these revelations, the one mystery that kept me reading never does get resolved. We don't learn if humans are truly wolflings or if they indeed have a lost patron. The way I interpret the resolution, it sounds like we are wolflings, but that's never made explicit. So for me, personally, this ending was a little disappointing, since it did not reveal what I wanted to know.In all fairness, however, that's my problem. Brin never promised he was going to tell us the answer to that question, and the answers he does provide (to questions that were unasked, at least by me) are pretty damn epic. It turns out that the corpse Streaker carries from the graveyard of ships belongs to a member of a species active back when the galaxies numbered seventeen, not five. That's right: the number of galaxies accessible through hyperspace have slowly been decreasing. Apparently this is due to the expanding universe and its corresponding metric causing ""tears"" in hyperspace, although Sarah the sooner mathematician begs to differ. Honestly, any explanation for something involving hyperspace is going to be technobabble and witchcraft, so let's not dwell on that part.The implications to this revelation are huge, of course. It speaks of manipulation on a massive scale, with the Galactic Library's records being altered to prevent mention of the last time this happened, 150 million years ago. And there is tragedy too, since it means anyone left in the galaxy or galaxies that get severed from the hyperspace routes are cut off from all galactic civilization, effectively forever. This is apparently why the Transcendents manipulated events, including much of the Streaker's journey, so they could eventually send a whole bunch of ships into a far-flung galaxy in an attempt to say ""hi"" to anyone left alive there.Brin does a nice job spelling it all out for us, and I guess it makes sense, but it all feels like it's coming out of left field. I wish he had included more foreshadowing in previous books—more than the vague references to ""a time of changes"" coming upon us. And he falls into a trap common for authors who postulate a chessmaster: suddenly the protagonists don't feel like they have much free will any more. Streaker spends most of the book waiting for things to happen and reacting, which isn't very exciting. It isn't until the final, post-climactic confrontation between Streaker and the fleet surrounding Earth that Gillian and her crew ever get a chance to do anything clever.When it comes to the new character introduced in this book, Harry Harms, I have to admit a soft-spot for talking chimpanzees. So he gets a pass from me, even though like Streaker, his role is more as an exposition trigger than anything else. He spends a lot of the time being gruff and incorrigible, as chimps ought to be, and that's just fine by me.More importantly, he allows Brin to explore an interesting motif about species-wide versus individual ""salvation."" The emphasis in galactic civilization is all about one's species. A client improves patron species over generations, and those species act ""for the good of the clan."" In the end, millions of years down the line, those species go on to retire, seek the Embrace of Tides, and hopefully Transcend. This is markedly different from the individualist attitudes championed by the wolfling Earthlings, and it is amusing to see such attitudes gaining a cult following on Tanith.This speaks to some of the deeper issues Brin has raised with his Uplift series. As we learn the truth about the Fractal World, about the white dwarf, the Transcendents, etc., we get a glimpse of the long, long game. Already, Brin had us thinking in terms of millions of years, and now he asks us to think about life in the universe by the billions of years. Maybe black holes are just a recycling unit, a way to get the older species out of the way so that new ones can emerge. Maybe they are a gateway to something beyond. Either way, it is a sobering reminder that, eventually, all things, all species, meet their end.I love the premise behind Uplift, and I love the way Brin uses it to explore the relationships among galactic species. As an astrophysicist, Brin at least knows when he's diverging from the science and into the realm of fiction—but as a writer, Brin's skills are … frustratingly inconsistent at best. I am about ready to take a good, long break from David Brin, but I still think this series is worth reading. It is some of the best science fiction I've read, for its careful balancing of space opera with posthumanism and ecological themes. Though Heaven's Reach did not deliver exactly what I expected, it was an interesting journey nonetheless.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101890.Heaven_s_Reach
The Positronic Man;Isaac Asimov;1992;1990;290;4.12;6922;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Robots', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Novels'];Powerful and haunting, The Positronic Man is an unforgettable novel that redefines Isaac Asimov's and Robert Silverberg's place among the greatest science fiction authors of all time.In the twenty-first century the creation of the positronic brain leads to the development of robot laborers and revolutionizes life on Earth. But to the Martin family, their household robot NDR-113 is more than a trusted friend, a confidant, a member of the family. For through some unknown manufacturing glitch, Andrew has been blessed with a capacity for love and a drive toward self-awareness and devlopment that are almost...human.But almost is not enough. Andrew's dream is to become fully human. Facing human prejudice, the laws of robotics, and his own mechanical limitations, Andrew will use science and law in his quest for the impossible, arriving at last at a terrifying choice: to make his dream a reality, he must pay the ultimate price.;"Like the most I read the short story ""Bicentennial Man"" first and quite recently too. This still hasn't diminished my enjoyment of the book. Asimov himself declared this his penultimate and favorite robot story and I find that it is mine too. Now, one can say that Silverberg just bloated up the story up to a full book which is basically true. But it also enriched the experience, primarily he given all the characters more depth in a way that Asimov never could. Now we must all begrudgingly agree that Asimov isn't a particularly good writer. I remember when I first started reading the Foundation series I was surprised by the simplicity of his characters especially when it came to presenting their inner thoughts. To me this was particularly obvious because previously I read the Ender series and I couldn't simply ignore his writing. But Asimov was a great SF writer, he brought to our minds some of the greatest ideas and concepts that captivate us to this day and put those first. Near the end of his career his writing did improve and he managed to write his most beautiful and touching robot story. And just like the first time I read the short story I was truly moved again after reading it in this form.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/651964.The_Positronic_Man
Ammonite;Nicola Griffith;1992;1990;416;3.9;6508;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Fantasy', 'Feminism', 'Lesbian'];Change or die. These are the only options available on the planet Jeep. Centuries earlier, a deadly virus shattered the original colony, killing the men and forever altering the few surviving women. Now, generations after the colony has lost touch with the rest of humanity, a company arrives to exploit Jeep–and its forces find themselves fighting for their lives. Terrified of spreading the virus, the company abandons its employees, leaving them afraid and isolated from the natives. In the face of this crisis, anthropologist Marghe Taishan arrives to test a new vaccine. As she risks death to uncover the women’s biological secret, she finds that she, too, is changing–and realizes that not only has she found a home on Jeep, but that she alone carries the seeds of its destruction. . . . Ammonite is an unforgettable novel that questions the very meanings of gender and humanity. As readers share in Marghe’s journey through an alien world, they too embark on a parallel journey of fascinating self-exploration.;"What a wonderful book! I’m having trouble collecting my thoughts on this one, so thought I’d let the author speak for herself. The following quotations are from a wise and funny interview Nicola Griffith gave shortly after the novel's release, back in the 90s:On the absence of men:“I do think the book had to struggle against the perception that it would be some kind of awful Womyn's Utopia peopled by seven feet tall, wise, kind, vegetarian amazons who burned men in effigy at the full moon. And there were probably many who wished it was one of those gals-as-one-of-the-boys books, where the woman drinks anything that pours, pilots anything that flies and fucks everything that moves. Instead, it's a book about people, every variety of people—smart and stupid, kind and venal, indifferent and vicious, etc.—who all happen to be women. This seems to upset some readers, who persist in seeing a book about women as a man-hating or man-fearing novel, when—if the book is defined in terms of men at all, which I find irritating—it is more accurately a man-less novel.”On how she feels about comparisons between Ammonite and Left Hand of Darkness:“Mixed: pleased, that my work is considered to be in the same class as Le Guin's; irritated, because I want my work to be sui generis. 'Darkness' is a marvellous piece of work. I borrowed from it quite consciously the idea of Marghe as a lone ambassador.”On trial-by-ice:“The snow and ice stuff seems to be a motif quite common to feminist work: Shelley's Frankenstein, Russ, Lessing, Slonczewski, Bryant, Charnas, Piercy etc. all use the trial-by-ice, Demeter myth in some form or another.”On the industrial revolution:“Not all matriarchies need be pastoral. Most women love technology: it saves our lives on a daily basis; it makes for speedy travel; it produces tampax, knives that stay eternally sharp, and agricultural machinery that takes the sweat out of growing potatoes and milking cows. It makes typing easier, hot movies possible, and twelve gauge shotguns affordable to all. Who doesn't like technology, really? There's nothing wrong with science and machines, but the Industrial Revolution changed us and our culture. It's time our values changed to match.”On the point of the book:“The point of the book is that gender, and biological sex, and sexual orientation don't matter, not really. What matters is how generous you are, or how willing to learn; how adaptable you can be, or how steadfast.”Source:https://web.archive.org/web/200805151...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180270.Ammonite
Remnant Population;Elizabeth Moon;1996;1990;325;4.1;6342;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Aliens', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction'];For forty years, Colony 3245.12 has been Ofelia’s home. On this planet far away in space and time from the world of her youth, she has lived and loved, weathered the death of her husband, raised her one surviving child, lovingly tended her garden, and grown placidly old. And it is here that she fully expects to finish out her days–until the shifting corporate fortunes of the Sims Bancorp Company dictates that Colony 3245.12 is to be disbanded, its residents shipped off, deep in cryo-sleep, to somewhere new and strange and not of their choosing. But while her fellow colonists grudgingly anticipate a difficult readjustment on some distant world, Ofelia savors the promise of a golden opportunity. Not starting over in the hurly-burly of a new community... but closing out her life in blissful solitude, in the place she has no intention of leaving. A population of one.With everything she needs to sustain her, and her independent spirit to buoy her, Ofelia actually does start life over–for the first time on her own terms: free of the demands, the judgments, and the petty tyrannies of others. But when a reconnaissance ship returns to her idyllic domain, and its crew is mysteriously slaughtered, Ofelia realizes she is not the sole inhabitant of her paradise after all. And, when the inevitable time of first contact finally arrives, she will find her life changed yet again–in ways she could never have imagined...;"old woman, tired of people, tired of the way people treat her, decides to stay behind when the rest of her fellow colonists are uprooted by their corporate bosses and sent to another planet. old woman, once surrounded by demanding and unloving voices, finds she loves being alone, no more annoying voices bossing her around, the only voices the ones in her head, now she has all the time in the world to garden and do beadwork and just do what she wants to do, alone. finally alone! but it turns out she's not alone on this world after all. I loved all the things this novel did with its protagonist. Ofelia is cantankerous and moody, she has to deal with her aching joints and a little loss of memory and having to use the bathroom all of the time; she has a couple voices in her head (the old her and the new, braver her) but she's far from crazy. Remnant Population doesn't downplay all of the physical and mental things she has to deal with but it also shows how she is just as resourceful and clever as anyone else - she's more than an equal to the men who have made demands on her all of her life and to those younger than her who would dismiss her knowledge as no longer relevant, practically useless. Ofelia cherishes her crafts and her vegetables and wearing or not wearing what she wants. I love how the novel spends so much time on the things she loves, on the beadwork and the sewing and the gardening and cooking and the freedom of bare skin in the sun. it was enchanting reading about Ofelia going through her daily life on her own, focusing on her tasks and ruminating on the past and considering her future. a truly enjoyable and unusual protagonist.the story brings humans back into her life, and of course the aliens. great aliens! vaguely like bipedal, mammalian owls. genuinely different, carefully crafted, surprisingly adorable aliens. those alien babies were the cutest.I like how Remnant Population is a feminist novel that critiques the roles women are often placed into by men (as well as the elderly by the young) but still embraces traits and activities that are considered stereotypically feminine. I hate either/or binaries and this novel doesn't have that. Ofelia is a three-dimensional character: strong and kind, unsentimental and maternal, resourceful and forgetful, sharp-tongued and grouchy and impatient, generous and open-hearted and patient.I like how Remnant Population illustrates the importance of freedom and time alone, but also recognizes that a fulfilling life will be one where a person is a part of some kind of a community - a place where the individual can be independent and true to themselves, but still be a useful part of a world and connected to the people in it. lovely message; lovely novel. and fun!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96284.Remnant_Population
The Time Ships;Stephen Baxter;1995;1990;520;3.95;6187;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Steampunk', 'Adventure', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"There is a secret passage through time...and it leads all the way to the end of Eternity. But the journey has a terrible cost. It alters not only the future but the ""present"" in which we live.A century after the publication of H. G. Wells' immortal The Time Machine, Stephen Baxter, today's most acclaimed new ""hard SF"" author, and the acknowledged Clarke, returns to the distant conflict between the Eloi and the Morlocks in a story that is at once an exciting expansion, and a radical departure based on the astonishing new understandings of quantum physics.";"In 1995, a hundred years after H.G. Wells's novel ""The Time Machine"", the Wells' estate authorised an official sequel by Stephen Baxter. The Time Ships went on to win several prestigious SF awards, including the British Science Fiction award for that year. It is an ambitious project and an exciting read in its own right.The novel starts where the original left off, in 1891, with ""the Time Traveller"" preparing to return to the year 802,701 to save Weena, the young female Eloi who died in the fire with the Morlocks, a fact for which he had felt guilty and responsible ever since.We learn that the time machine had been constructed from quartz, and fuelled by a radioactive substance called ""Plattnerite"", which had been given to the traveller by an unknown and mysterious benefactor, twenty years earlier. Incidentally, Stephen Baxter has coined this word using the name of a character in one of Wells's short stories entitled ""The Plattner Story"". Published in a collection in 1897, the story is about a school teacher, ""Gottfried Plattner"" who chemically analyses a green powder of uncertain origin which had been given him by his students. When lit, the powder violently launches him into a mysterious parallel dimension, where he is observed by mute ""Watchers of the Living"". There are further references to these beings later in this novel.With the aid of the Plattnerite, the Time Traveller sets off into the future and stops in 657,208 , when the daytime sky has gone permanently dark. At this point there is an unexpected twist in the tale, as the traveller is horrifed to find himself seized and abducted by a gang of Morlocks. However, these Morlocks turn out to be far more more culturally advanced than the ones he met before. The traveller feels the same repugnance for the Morlocks that he did before, but gradually comes to realise that it is the Morlocks who have inherited the world's knowledge and civilisation, and not the Eloi.Stephen Baxter introduces the second main character at this point - the Morlock Nebogipfel. Here he has appropriated a name which H. G. Wells used in an earlier short story - also about a time machine - called ""The Chronic Argonauts"". The Time Traveller assumes that Nebogipfel is a vastly important being in this society. He is sadly disillusioned to find that, on the contrary, Nebogipfel is a teacher, and not considered very knowledgable at all. Because the Morlock has an unusual interest in ancient times and cultures, he was given the task of caring for the Time Traveller. After hearing the Time Traveller's own story Nebogipfel explains that the conflict between Eloi and Morlocks never occurred, because of ""the Writer"" (ie. H. G. Wells)'s publication of the story which became ""The Time Machine"". A neat little joke there on the current author's part! But it therefore followed that Weena would be impossible to locate, because the timeline he sought to go to was now inaccessible. There are a lot of definitions and explanations relating to quantum physics, which the reader assumes to be either theoretical or even pseudoscience. It is tempting to wonder whether H. G. Wells himself would have written this sort of hard SF, had he had access to the scientific advancements of the next hunded years. It is certainly consistent with the style of his SF novels and stories. Another example of this is the ""Dyson sphere"" which from Nebogipfel's description, the Morlocks in the present timeline have evidently constructed around the inner solar system. They use the sun's energy to power it. (A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical colossal spherical structure, constructed around a star, completely surrounding it, thereby capturing most or all of its power output.) The Time Traveller is told that descendants of the humans he expected to see do exist, but they live on the sunlit inner surface of the Sphere, while the Morlocks live on the outer shell. Eventually the Time Traveller manages to capitalise on Nebogipfel's interest and desire to learn about him, and tricks the Morlock into taking him back to his Time machine, ostensibly so that he can show Nebogipfel how it works. The reader is identifying with the Time Traveller by this point, so has a good idea of what will happen next. Sure enough, as soon as he can, the Time Traveller reactivates his machine and travels to 1873 to persuade his younger self to stop his research on Plattnerite. He had tried to escape alone, but as soon as Nebogipfel realised what he was doing, and much to the Time Traveller's disgust incidentally, he grabbed hold of him to follow him there. There follows the sort of scene much beloved by all SF readers, an apparent impossibility due to diverging timelines, where the Time Traveller meets his younger self. The author and the viewpoint character call this younger self ""Moses"", which is the original Time Traveller's name in H. G. Wells's book. The Time Traveller attempts to persuade his younger self to stop his research by using Nebogipfel's appearance as proof that reality is changed by time travel. This part of the book is full of wit and gentle humour. It is very much in keeping with Wells's writing style, and the stiffness and pomposity of Edwardian characters is well conveyed, amusing both the viewpoint character, reverting backwards from his point in time, and the readers, from ours. The Time Traveller is stupefied to see an enormous tank pull into Moses's yard, and equally so when the commanding officer on board is not a man but a young woman, Hilary Bond. She is accompanied by the Time Traveller's friend Filby, now much older. They all seem to know more about what is happening than either the Time traveller or Moses, and take both of them, plus Nebogipfel, forward to their 1938, where World War I is still continuing. Much subdued, the Time Traveller is told that this is partly due to the discovery of time travel, which had been influenced by his work. Britain's major cities are all encased in domes, and they are still at war with Germany. Baxter's inclusion of domes here is reminiscent of the post world war ""Bombproofs"" mentioned as existing in London after the second world war in H. G. Wells' novel ""The Shape of Things to Come."" As well as referencing Wells, Baxter also introduces an actual person from history here, an Austrian expatriate Kurt Gödel, who was considered to be one of the most significant logicians in history. In real life, Gödel made an immense impact upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century. In this novel, the British government hoped to win the war by making use of Gödel's experiments, to alter Germany's history.Nebogipfel realises and explains to both the Time Traveller and the reader that this is yet another future, resulting from their actions when they met Moses. During a bombing raid on London by the Germans, Gödel shows the travellers that not only does he have a vial of Plattnerite, but also the prototype of a Time-Car. The Time Traveller and Nebogipfel manage to escape, but Moses is killed in an explosion when he tries to save Gödel. In this section of the book, Gödel comes across almost as a mouthpiece for H. G. Wells, as Baxter makes him a prescient character describing what society would be like after the war. This is a very bleak and pessimistic view, which seems to be similar to Wells's own. With no clear plan, the Time Traveller and Nebogipfel are thrust back to the Paleocene, where the time machine is wrecked on a tree. They barely survive, and adapt to their new lives in the Paleocene, which seems now to be permanent. At one point, the Time Traveller nearly dies because of a bacterial infection, as his body is not adapted to the environment. This reminds the reader very much of the ending of H. G. Wells's novel, ""The War of the Worlds"" when it is the Martians who succumb.Eventually a scouting party from the ""Chronic Expeditionary Force"" in 1944 discovers them. It is commanded by Hilary Bond, who had investigated human archaeological remains in her time, and deduced from their discrepancy in the fossil record, where the Time Traveller and Nebogipfel would be likely to have arrived. Ironically, it transpires that a German Messerschmitt plane has followed them, and it drops a ""Carolinum"" bomb, on the site, leaving virtually nothing but devastation.This is another example of Baxter's theorising and literary references. In our world the bomb would be an atomic bomb, with its nuclear energy produced by uranium. In this novel the science is slightly different. The suggestion is that the universe of the Time Traveller is not ours, but a slightly different one, consistent with H. G. Wells's novels. In Wells's world, nuclear energy is produced from a material called carolinum, which allows Plattnerite to be produced relatively easily. These Carolinum bombs, contrary to A-bombs, continue to detonate for years with an eerie purple glow. The name ""carolinum"", and the reference to continuous detonation are both based on Wells's novel, which he called ""The World Set Free"". Prophetically, he wrote it in 1913, and in it H. G. Wells predicted nuclear weapons of a more destructive and uncontrollable sort than the world has yet seen.Nebogipfel and the Time Traveller return to the devastated campsite, and over the next year and a half, a handful of maimed surviving soldiers including Hilary Bond start a colony which they call ""First London."" Nebogipfel insists on repairing the Time-Car although the Time Traveller is irritated by what he sees as a useless waste of time. As one would expect in a good SF story however, shavings of Plattnerite were somehow acquired to power it on a journey through time. The Time Traveller and Nebogipfel travel through fifty million years, seeing ""First London"" expand and develop colonies on the moon and in Earth's orbit. They also witness extensive human destruction of the Earth's environment, rendering the planet uninhabitable.Eventually they run out of Plattnerite fuel, and wake up to find they are being looked after by a ""Universal Constructor"", which Nabogipfel has worked out must be a colony of life forms based on nanotechnology. Few stars are left in the night sky, because Dyson Spheres have been constructed around many host stars to provide colonies. None of the beings who have descended from humans are at all recognisable as life forms to either Nabofgipfel or the Time Traveller, being far distant in time from either. The Universal Constructor's goal is to harvest the energy of the sun, using the Plattnerite to build time-travel vehicles to travel to the beginning of the universe. Nebogipfel, who has been partly enhanced with nanotechnology, works out that this goal will take a million years, a time period which does not seem to signify to either him or the Universal Constructor.The Time Traveller however, sees that it is not necessary to wait for a million years. They acquire enough Plattnerite from the Constructors to travel forward a million years in their time machine, to when the Constructors will have finished building their time ships. Once there, reality seems to change, and there is clearly a grand plan with different beings or a consciousness which replaces the Universal Constructor. Although it is unseeable and virtually unknowable, Nebogipfel and the Time Traveller deduce that the new consciousness seems to have more understanding than the Universal Constructor whom it replaces. As a consequence, the Time Traveller and Nebogipfel are relocated to 1871, in the Time Traveller's original history. Gratifyingly, as the reader suspects, the Time Traveller himself had been the mysterious stranger with the Plattnerite sample. Under the alias ""Gottfried Plattner"", he had given the sample to his younger self. Because of this, the timelines are consistent, and the history which ends up creating the Constructors and their successors proceeds. Nebogipfel, always eager for knowledge and new experiences, leaves the Time Traveller behind to travel with the successors of the Constructors. But the story would not satisfy unless it concluded with an attempt to save Weena. The Time Traveller makes one final journey forward to a slightly earlier point in 802,701, and in a very exciting episode just manages to save Weena from the death she suffered before. But since the timeline must not be changed again, the Time Traveller has to destroy the machine. He stays with the Eloi, encouraging them to learn how to farm and to gradually reduce their dependence on the Morlocks for food and clothing, so that they will one day be separate. The Time Traveller writes an account of his adventures sealing it within some Plattnerite, in the hope that it would be found at some point in the future. He finally records that he plans to go into the world of the Morlocks again, so that he could add an appendix to the story. The last sentence of the novel says that no appendix was found.Stephen Baxter has written a hugely ambitious sequel, which succeeds on just about every level. It captures the voice and style of H.G. Wells, as well as being an absorbing and exciting read on its own. The characters are engaging throughout, and the development of the Morlocks provide a very neat twist on the original. References to Wells's other works, mean that the novel is even more enjoyable.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62992.The_Time_Ships

Greg Egan, how do you plead?- Not guilty, your honour.- Mr Egan, what is your profession?- I am a science-fiction writer, your honour.- What kind of science-fiction writer?- An Australian science-fiction writer, your honour.- Your country of origin is immaterial, Mr Egan. We wish to ascertain what sort of science-fiction you claim to produce.- Some people quite like it, your honour.- Mr Egan, I see I shall have to phrase my questions more precisely. Are you what is generally known as a ""hard"" science-fiction writer?- I have been called that, your honour.- Do you accept this description? Is it one you consciously attempt to live up to?- It's hard to say what's conscious and what's unconscious, your honour. I'm just trying to tell a story.- Mr Egan, please restrain your feeble attempts at humour. You generally manage to do that in your published works. Would you care to explain to the court, in your own words, what you consider differentiates ""hard"" science-fiction from other kinds of science-fiction?- Well your honour, I would say that it involves making a serious attempt to get the science right.- Thank you, Mr Egan. Now, you have been referred to at various times as ""the king of hard science-fiction"". You are presumably aware of that?- I have seen the expression, your honour.- Have you seen it often, Mr Egan?- Quite often, your honour.- When did you see it last, Mr Egan? We are trying to establish what ""quite often"" means.- Your honour, about a minute and a half ago I received a mail from someone called nrrrdgrrrls4eva who used that phrase.- Since you appear to have this document to hand, Mr Egan, would you perhaps read it out to the court?- Yes your honour. It starts like this. Greg, you are the king of hard science-fiction. I am now rereading Orthogonal again, I just wanted to you to know that every time I get to the bit about the quaternions and the spinors it makes me so wet that I--- Thank you Mr Egan, that will be sufficient.- Yes, your honour.- Mr Egan, does quantum mechanics play an important part in your novel Quarantine?- It does, your honour.- In what way would you say that you treated the subject of quantum mechanics in that work?- In a non-standard way, your honour.- Mr Egan, do you know anything about quantum mechanics?- I like to think I do, your honour.- In that case, can you tell us how you believe other experts on quantum mechanics would view its treatment in your book?- It would depend on the person in question, your honour.- Do you imagine that most of them would consider your treatment credible?- Probably not, your honour.- Would they, perhaps, consider it implausible in the extreme?- They might, your honour.- Would they go so far as to call it complete and utter nonsense?- I can't rule that out, your honour.- Yet you sell your books as ""hard science fiction"". Do you consider that you are treating your readers in a fair and ethical manner, Mr Egan?- Your honour, I have very limited influence on my publisher's marketing department.- Mr Egan, we want to know why you did this.- With all respect, your honour, the notion of ""motivation"" is philosophically slippery. And when creating literary works, the reasons behind an author's artistic choices may be particularly hard to reconstruct. Plato, in The Republic--- Mr Egan, I shall have to ask you to keep to the point. Plato is not on trial here. And he was not a science-fiction writer.- Your honour, the late Mr Kingsley Amis argued, I think quite convincingly, that Plato's Critias is perhaps the first clear example of--- Mr Egan, I find it tedious to repeat myself on such elementary matters, but Plato wrote philosophy, not science-fiction. I do not suppose that you consider your novel to be a piece of philosophy?- As a matter of fact, your honour--- Thank you. I am sure we would all enjoy continuing this discussion, but unfortunately we have a schedule to keep. Have the members of the jury reached a verdict?- We have, your honour. We unanimously find the defendant guilty on all counts.- Sentencing will be postponed until next week. I need to think of something sufficiently cruel and unusual.- Yes, your honour.- That brings this session of the Court of Public Opinion to a close.

China Mountain Zhang;Maureen F. McHugh;1992;1990;313;3.95;4827;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Dystopia', 'Queer', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"With this groundbreaking novel, Maureen F. McHugh established herself as one of the decade's best science fiction writers. In its pages, we enter a post-revolution America, moving from the hyper-urbanized eastern seaboard to the Arctic bleakness of Baffin Island; from the new Imperial City to an agricultural commune on Mars. The overlapping lives of cyber-kite fliers, lonely colonists, illicit neural-pressball players, and organic engineers blend into a powerful, taut story of a young man's journey of discovery. This is a macroscopic world of microscopic intensity, one of the most brilliant visions of modern SF.";"China Mountain Zhang is an impressive work, well deserving of its Hugo and Nebula nominations and its Tiptree and Lambda awards. Thoughtful, precise writing and Zhang’s fully developed characterization make this a stand-out read, with only overall structure and the subject of one point of view preventing me from awarding a full five stars.Setting is thoughtfully built; information about society is shared indirectly through character experience. China appears to be the dominant world power after the economic collapse of America and a subsequent socialist revolution. Naturally, a change in social order accompanies the shift, and China-born Chinese are at the top, followed by the ABCs (American-Born Chinese), and then the non-Chinese. In this distant future, bio-engineering has progressed enough that people can go in for genetic re-engineering. Everyone has an implanted machine interface/implant that not only provides personal information on demand but allows people to link their nervous system into computer systems. Mars has been colonized, overcrowding is a serious issue, and like many visions of future bureaucracies, getting a job or housing is almost impossible without connections or money.One of the strengths of the book is fabulous characterization. Interestingly, in the beginning, I found the character China Mountain Zhang hard to like. A bit immature, he spends most of his time at work, with a friend, Peter, or at the flier races. Zhang is of mixed race, Hispanic and Chinese, but since his parents paid for genetic engineering when he was young, he appears to be full-blood Chinese. Born in Brooklyn, he has remained a New Yorker even after his father has left for California and his mother for Pennsylvania. His first challenge comes from his Chinese boss, who wants to introduce Zhang to his unmarriageable daughter. Issues of respect, his boss’ economic power over him and a Chinese emphasis on ethnic purity are a delicate dance to negotiate, particularly because Zhang is gay. Although New York gay culture is lively, being ‘bent’ is technically forbidden, and in China is likely to merit the firing squad. I found Zhang’s management of the his boss and the daughter somewhat immature, but appreciated it later as contrast for his personal development.Zhang wrestles with emotional issues on a ‘date’ with malformed San-xiang:This is a night she will remember all her life, the night when she went to the kite races. How many nights do I remember? How many special nights have I had in my life? Is it so much to give up a night?‘Let’s get something to eat and then see how late it is, maybe stop in for a drink,’ I say. She smiles up at me. Oh, the dangers of pity.The writing shines. McHugh negotiates the world through her characters, and the clean prose captures Zhang’s voice well, along with the voices of the colonists. Sophisticated philosophical and emotional truths are communicated in Zen-like essence. San-xiang, the boss’ daughter, shares a personal insight and the emotional core of the book:“‘I used to think I was unhappy because my father was in trouble and we had to come here, but now I don’t think it makes any difference. If you’re a certain kind of person, you’ll be unhappy wherever you are.’I have no doubt she considers herself that certain kind of person…It doesn’t make any difference if you did or you didn’t,’ [go to China] she says, ‘because you would still be you. And if you were unhappy here, you’d be unhappy there.”Zhang at dinner with his mother encapsulates years of history in one short meal:“‘It’s a lie,’ I say, ‘and you always told me that a lie always creates complications.’ But my face is a lie as well, and she condoned that. I am sure she hears the accusation, but we never talk about my mother’s contradictions.She does not touch me, although for a moment I think she is going to cover my hand with hers and I am afraid.”My trouble with the structure of China Mountain Zhang is not the writing, nor the characters. In her post on Tor, writer Jo Walton calls the style of China Mountain Zhang a ‘mosaic novel,’ and goes on to call it one of the best mosaic novels ever written. After doing a little research on the term, I’d have to disagree with her; interestingly, my difficulties with the book are same reasons it doesn’t quite work as a mosaic. The term ‘mosaic novel’ refers to a collection of stories “with the aim of telling a linear story from beginning to end” despite each individual chapter reflecting multiple viewpoints or styles (sadly, at least according to academia, I’m quoting Wikipedia here). Much like it’s visual art equivalent, intention is to create an uniform whole out of individual pieces.However, the undeniable focus of the book is Zhang, both in title and subject. In a linear timeline about a decade long, we follow Zhang through a significant emotional and professional development. Out of a multitude of chapters, there are only four where he is on the periphery, guest appearance only: a story about a cyber-kite flier, Angel; one centering on an ‘ugly’ Chinese woman, San-xiang, who seeks genetic modification; and two set on Mars, one focused on each member of a farming collective couple, Martine and Alexi. The flier’s story is interesting, but thematically peripheral. The Martian couple’s story collective story gives insight into the new society and is satisfactorily self-contained. San-xiang’s explores issues attractiveness post-genetic modification. Given that the title is the main character’s name, and the bulk of the collection is focused on Zhangs’s viewpoint, growth and experience, as a book it doesn’t quite achieve the goal of the mosaic, but also falls strangely short of linear narrative.My one other concern isSan-Xiang’s point of view. After her genetic modification, she has to learn a new way to interact with the world in terms of her sexuality. To absolutely no female reader’s surprise, it results in rape. Given the prevalence of the female rape scene in literature, I found it disappointing that McHugh used one of the rare non-Zhang viewpoints in such a standard way. I’m not sure of her message, but I wonder if McHugh is actually trying to give voice to the Chinese women now who are assaulted as they negotiate their own independence from their families. My feeling was that given our intimacy with Zhang’s viewpoint, positioning the issue within the gay community (especially when assault could not have been reported without risk) would have been more powerful.However, those are rather small issues given the excellent characterization and well-thought out vision of the future. Highly recommended for fans of dystopias as well as anyone who loves a good story.http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/1...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/836964.China_Mountain_Zhang
The Hunger Games;Suzanne Collins;2008;2000;374;4.34;8928449;yes;['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Teen', 'Post Apocalyptic'];Could you survive on your own in the wild, with every one out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.;"Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.  
Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
“But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.  And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 

 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue... Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose death scene brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------
EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness. I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games
Catching Fire;Suzanne Collins;2009;2000;391;4.33;3695344;yes;['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Audiobook', 'Teen'];Sparks are igniting.Flames are spreading.And the Capitol wants revenge. Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol—a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create. Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest that she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.In Catching Fire, the second novel of the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before . . . and surprising readers at every turn.;I went to see Inglourious Basterds a couple of times this past month, and there is that scene where Eli Roth and Omar Doom are in the theater, and they dress themselves up to look like waiters and then whip around the corner and kill the two Nazi guards to some funny Ennio Morriconi(ish?), spaghetti-western sounding music. And everybody in the theater laughs, and then the film cuts to Hitler laughing, watching a movie of a Nazi soldier killing Americans. It’s one of those great story-telling moments where I’m nice and comfortable and morally superior, until I realize that actually I’m exactly the same as someone I think is Evil. There was a moment when I first saw Merchant of Venice that was like that, and I was depressed for a month after I read Notes from the Underground because of the same type of experience. I don’t know where you get that brand of story-telling ability, but Suzanne Collins has it coming out of her ears, in the sort of young adult variety. Catching Fire was maybe not as striking as the first book in this series, The Hunger Games, in making me disturbed about myself, but it definitely had its moments. Also, I was in my second week of law school and had just gotten back from an exhausting wedding when I read it, so I might not have had the capacity to self-reflect that I normally do. If you don’t know already, even though you should know, the premise of this series is a that in the future, post-apocalyptic world of the super-badass Katniss Everdeen, one rich city controls twelve poor-to-starving cities that produce all of the goods for the rich city. In order to keep the poor cities in fear, the rich city requires each of the poor cities to send one teenage boy and one teenage girl as tributes to play the Hunger Games. In the Hunger Games the kids have to kill each other until there is one survivor, who gets to party for the rest of his/her life but never really feels like partying because everything’s so fucked up. Usually they go crazy, if they didn’t start out that way. It’s very Lord of the Flies, and yes it is the same premise as Battle Royale, but not as determinedly nasty as those two books. Also, girl action hero! Anyway, a couple of days after I finished this book, I was spacing off instead of briefing cases, and I started thinking about the description of the capital city that controls the other cities. There is a part where Katniss and another character have to go to a party at the capital, and there are as many amazing foods as they can imagine. It’s a big party, and they’re celebrities, and everyone loves them. They have one bite of every kind of food, so that they can taste everything, but unfortunately they get full. One of their entourage explains to them that there are puke closets, so that everyone can keep eating for the whole night, and our two characters suddenly step back from the party and remember their families and neighbors, who are starving while the capital lives in decadence. I was thinking about that and how the shallow people in the capital city were just as culpable for the evil in their society as the military that imposed starvation on the cities, and then, suddenly, I realized, duh, she’s talking about me. This story is really about the global economy, and (passive, consumption-driven U.S. citizen that I am) I’m not the hero. So, that’s about three times this month that I’ve been on the side of terrorists. I don’t know whether that means story-tellers are gettin’ pretty tricky, or if it just means I think there’s a problem with the way stuff is. Or that, like, I’m becoming a rager, or something. (FBI, if you’re reading this, JK about this whole paragraph. LOL!)When I was working my 8-5 job last year, I started listening to some iTunesU classes while I was doing my work so that my brain wouldn’t die. One of them was given by Carolyn Marvin at Stanford, and it was called “True Colors: Myth, Magic, and the American Flag.” The premise, to summarize very briefly, was that for any culture to stay together, the culture requires a blood sacrifice. This article goes into more detail about nationalism and blood sacrifice. She really convincingly pointed out how, civilized though we think we are, blood sacrifice in modern Western culture is not really significantly different than tribal human sacrifices. It’s a seriously creepy theory, but I’m not kidding when I say that she’s right. Really, listen to the lecture. So, I’ve spent a lot of time in the past couple of weeks doing a mental compare/contrast of the U.S. with this futuristic dystopia. We don’t come off looking too good, guys. Obviously these are really complicated topics, but nothing seems as simple as “violence is not the answer” or, on the other side of the argument, “destroy civilization.” I’m not positive what the right answer is, but I’d like to find out. I think Suzanne Collins’s books should be taught in high school social studies classes, so maybe we could get some young brains working on this problem. How do we effectively refuse to benefit from universally destructive and dehumanizing trade practices, but still live healthy and productive lives?So, go read everything Suzanne Collins ever wrote (including the episodes of Clarissa Explains It All because that show is awesome) and reflect on international trade and the global economy. I don’t know if you’ll be a better person for it, but I think so. Maybe after you do all that reading you can help me figure out some way for us not to be Evil.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6148028-catching-fire
The Time Traveler’s Wife;Audrey Niffenegger;2003;2000;537;4.0;1805830;no;['Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Adult'];This is the extraordinary love story of Clare and Henry, who met when Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-two and Henry was thirty. Impossible but true, because Henry suffers from a rare condition where his genetic clock periodically resets and he finds himself pulled suddenly into his past or future. In the face of this force they can neither prevent nor control, Henry and Clare’s struggle to lead normal lives is both intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.;"I'm only adding this book because it annoys me that it popped up on the ""most popular reads."" People, this book is terrible. Do yourself a favor and pretend you'd never heard of it. My short answer is that it's just no good, the long version is in the following list, which I call ""The Problems I Have With The Time-Traveler's Wife.""1. The author is indecisive. Rather than accepting that this is a science-fiction novel, she tries to write a social commentary, romance, and art and music novel all rolled into one. There is so much name-dropping that it's distracting—classical music, entomology, poetry, romance languages, library science, the American punk scene, constructivist painters, you get the idea—they're all continually cropping up at the most inane times. What should give us a better understanding of the characters actually paints them as shells of people, identified only by superficialities. There is one completely pointless mention of a Moholy-Nagy poster that really annoyed me. I had five years of design school and while I know who Laszlo Moholy-Nagy is and how to correctly pronounce his name, I couldn't pick one of his paintings out of a lineup of his contemporaries, so I didn't even buy that this dude who has spent half of his life in limbo was some kind of expert.2. The title character's entire life and family are so difficult to relate to that I immediately hated her. She grew up in a house that has books written about it (irritating architecture reference) and everyone must ""dress"" for dinner at her parents' house, as if this were a Brontë novel.3. Her family employ five black servants. In a Christmas scene, for which the servants are unchained from the stove and allowed into the dining room, the cook actually toasts to ""Miz Abshire.""This book was written in 2004! How can the ""Mammy"" have any place here? She isn't even the only racially stereotyped character in this book. The traveler's childhood downstairs neighbor, a grandmotherly woman he refers to as Kimmy, speaks in a broken English which could have been stolen directly from a hateful gold rush-era cartoon.4. The book skips back and forth between the point-of-view of the title character and the time-traveler himself, but there is absolutely no difference in their voices. I think I actually got confused a few times about who was speaking. 5. The phrase, “she was pale under her makeup” was used three times.6. The chapters dealing with infertility were completely unoriginal, boring, and emotionally flat.7. Not only are conversations unnecessarily long, but they are often followed by page after page of internal dialogue as the characters rehash and analyze every point of said conversation.Sorry this was so long, but this might be the worst book I've ever read and I'm really confused by all the good reviews.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18619684-the-time-traveler-s-wife
The Maze Runner;James Dashner;2009;2000;384;4.05;1564250;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Post Apocalyptic'];There are alternate cover editions for this ASIN here and here.If you ain’t scared, you ain’t human. When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his name. He’s surrounded by strangers—boys whose memories are also gone. Nice to meet ya, shank. Welcome to the Glade. Outside the towering stone walls that surround the Glade is a limitless, ever-changing maze. It’s the only way out—and no one’s ever made it through alive. Everything is going to change. Then a girl arrives. The first girl ever. And the message she delivers is terrifying. Remember. Survive. Run.;"You know how sometimes you're running really fast from a horrible creature and, in a moment of panic, you turn around to see how close it is only to run straight into a brick wall?No?I don't know what that's like either. But that inattention to detail would probably totally screw you over because a.) now you're knocked unconscious and b.) the creature is going to devour you. Good job.I guess this is kind of like Lot's wife looking back on Sodom only to be turned into a pillar of salt. And it is also kind of like reading The Maze Runner. Stick with me. The first half of James Dashner's The Maze Runner maintains a superbly frantic pace. Thomas, our empty-shell-of-a-protagonist is thrust, via the Box, into a curious and unfriendly world populated by dozens of teenage boys. He remembers nothing, and the boys are uncooperative, refusing to reveal any details regarding their home, the Glade. The Glade is surrounded by stupendously tall walls, outside of which lays the Maze. During the day, the Maze is (kinda sorta) safe. But at night, the Grievers emerge. These are half slug/half woodshop tools that enjoy slicing and dicing apart anyone unfortunate to encounter them. They can also sting you, which causes much mayhem and requires the administering of Grief Serum, which triggers the Changing. SIDEBAR!What Is It With Authors Of Dystopian Novels Capitalizing Really Important Words? It's Annoying. Find A New Stylistic Approach That I Can Later Become Exasperated With.Anyway, Thomas' situation is bleak, made bleaker when a number of unfortunate coincidences causes him to bear witness to some truly awful acts of violence. Let's just say one untrustworthy soul is unwittingly tossed into the Maze at night and then a girl (not a boy!!!!!!!!) suspiciously arrives the day after Thomas. All of this, despite the Unnecessary Capitalization and the boys using completely pointless terminology like klunk and shuckface, is totally kitty fantastico. The constant psychological mystery keeps nagging doubts at bay and the variety of personalities that populate the Glade is totally believable. They talk like teenagers, they (generally) act like teenagers, and they form cliques and factions the way teenagers would. (From here on I'm covering up ""spoilers"", even though I think they're total nonsense and hilariously awful. And because I advise you not to read this book, you should click them. Just keeping the haters at bay.)Then Thomas spends a night in the Maze.And the book falls apart. For those of you paying attention, here's where the running into a brick wall metaphor arrives full gale.Dashner, whose prose has heretofore been mediocre but serviceable, completely fails his audience. He writes himself into a corner. He knows it, we know it. Thomas, who has always been slightly unlikeable and jerky becomes even more unlikeable and jerky, and the plot holes start opening up like the really bad similes peppered throughout the narrative. How does Dashner patch them up? Telepathy! Seriously. Telepathy! Yup. The girl who mysteriously appeared communicates with Thomas with her mind and tells him all sorts of shit that's supposed to clear everything up. It doesn't. It just creates a frustrating deus ex machina that could have been avoided, but isn't.As Thomas's character stumbles upon more and more unbelievable clues, like the moving walls of the maze actually form patterns of letters (that Thomas will eventually and conveniently know what to do with after experiencing the Changing himself), the book loses its momentum significantly. In fact, despite tearing through the first half of the book, I had to put it down. Afterwards, every time I looked at that stupid green cover, I found myself filled with dread - knowing full well that what remained would irritate me. And it did.Sometimes when the first book of a trilogy ends on a cliffhanger, I feel compelled to continue. I don't care what happens to Thomas and the rest of the characters. Maybe they'll smoke lots of pot, form a commune, and grow daisies. Maybe they'll turn into Grievers. Maybe they'll run into Katniss and Peeta and become BFFs. But I will let you, gentle reader, find that out for yourself.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6186357-the-maze-runner
The Host;Stephenie Meyer;2008;2000;624;3.86;1018044;no;['Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Paranormal'];"Melanie Stryder refuses to fade away. The earth has been invaded by a species that take over the minds of human hosts while leaving their bodies intact. Wanderer, the invading ""soul"" who has been given Melanie's body, didn't expect to find its former tenant refusing to relinquish possession of her mind.As Melanie fills Wanderer's thoughts with visions of Jared, a human who still lives in hiding, Wanderer begins to yearn for a man she's never met. Reluctant allies, Wanderer and Melanie set off to search for the man they both love.Also see: Alternate Cover Editions for this ISBN [ACE]

ACE #2";"I originally had not planned on even reading this book because the Twilight series instills much rage within my soul, but I was in a dry spell for reading, so I decided to give it a try. I have to say I really enjoyed it much more than the Twilight series. I have seen a lot of people complain about how slow the beginning was, but I didn’t really notice. It sucked me in pretty quickly. It was very clearly a Stephenie Meyer book, though, which did lead to certain amounts of anger and eyes rolling nearly out of my head.---My biggest complaint with Stephenie Meyer is her romantic plots. I feel like I’ve accidentally picked up a Harlequin romance. It is super cheesy and super melodramatic. It makes my brain hurt. Here’s an example: “I stared into Jared’s eyes, and the strangest thing happened. All the melting, melding, welding that I had just been through was shoved aside, into the smallest part of my body, the little corner that I took up physically. The rest of me yearned toward Jared with the same desperate, half-crazed hunger I’d felt since the first time I’d seen him here. This body barely belonged to me or to Mel—it belonged to him” (595, ARC). WHAT! First, horribly cheesy. Second, nobody but you owns your body, and if you find it romantic to think otherwise, that is unhealthy. Let’s learn some emotional and physical independence!What the hell is up with underage characters and older men?! Why could the females not be slightly older? This is supposedly being marketed as an adult book, so maybe it’s a bit alienating to make your main character(s) 16 when she first meets Jared who was 26, then 17 when she was starting in a new body (which they thought was younger!) when Ian is in his mid-20’s (I am guessing).I’m just glad the romantic interests were not supposed to be seen as perfect. They had similar flaws as Edward & Jacob, but we were not reminded every 20 seconds how easily they dazzled everyone. Jared can barely stand Wanderer for most of the book. He would kill her easily if it weren’t Mel’s body. He is cruel and violent towards her. Ian is the first to physically assault her. And then in the end he does it again, while also being a bit violent toward Sunny & Jared. Of course, Ian ends up pretty near perfect with his perfect understanding and perfect kindness and perfect love. But I will accept this because I think that his perfect personality fits with the gentle, loving, peaceful personality of Wanderer.---While still cheesy, there were bits that were not romance-based that were emotionally compelling. I felt Wanderer’s fear about what she had to do in the end. In the tunnel on the way to Doc for the last time, when she asked Jared where everyone slept when it rained, my heart ached for her. I thought that was a lovely way of noting how much she still really wanted to find out about this world and how much she was going to miss and that life was going to go on without her. I know, I know, we are being emotionally manipulated, because if you don’t know how it’s going to end before you even pick it up, you haven’t read enough in life. But if you put yourself in the character��s place when she has a very clear idea of what is going to happen, it’s pretty sad.---The thing that made me love this is that it is not a romance. It is a story about humanity with romance thrown in. I like looking at humanity through alien eyes. I like learning what it means to be human with Wanderer. I like the interactions between Mel and Wanderer. I like that Wanderer picked up sarcasm from Mel. I love how absolutely confused she initially is by humans. She views humans as violent, hateful creatures. She is confused when they feed and protect her. This completely goes against her view of humanity.I like how we perceive the humans through her eyes, how we get an idea of their motives from her which she is normally wrong about, and then we slowly see the change. This is seen especially with Doc. I enjoyed seeing how Wanderer reacted to humans and how her perception of them changed. She goes from being terrified of humans to constantly surprised and confused by how good they end up being to loving them and embracing her own humanity. But throughout it she is ashamed of betraying her kind and feels like a traitor. She constantly second guesses herself, whether it’s in favor of the humans or the souls. It’s not until the end when she really accepts that maybe what she does is wrong, but if it brings about good then it’s the best thing for her to do.---I like the question of how much of yourself comes from some ethereal personality/soul and how much comes from your physical body. What makes us human? What parts of us do people fall in love with? Are we more physical, spiritual, emotional? It’s a bit cheesy (have I said that enough?), but I like the idea portrayed when Ian says, “It’s not the face, but the expressions on it. It’s not the voice, but what you say. It’s not how you look in that body, but the things you do with it” (p. 397, ARC). And then we get to see Wanderer in two different bodies which change her a bit. We have weak v. strong, etc. When in Mel’s body, Wanderer feels a physical longing for Jared but an emotional one for Ian. After she is put in a new body, she still loves Jared. Melanie occasionally seems overly familiar with Ian before remembering who she is. Jared stares searchingly and confusedly at Wanderer. What makes someone who they are? What part of a person do others connect with?---There are a lot of small touches that really pleased me. I love how people act and react in this book.I thought it was hilarious when Wes (?) said, “You may have taken the planet, but you’re losing this game,” when they were playing soccer. That's just funny to me. If you can't use humor to cope with the apocalypse, you'll never make it.A reaction that rings completely true is when, after Wanderer walks in on the dissections and is absolutely horrified, the guys are confused about why she is so upset when they were sure to cover the bodies so she couldn’t have seen anything. However, they only covered the human bodies. They still see the souls as alien and other which negates understanding and compassion.I love what happens in the following bit: “’Ah,’ the seeker’s familiar voice moaned from the human body. ‘Ah.’ / The room went utterly silent. Everyone looked at me, as if I were the expert on humans” (p. 553, ARC). Of course that is how they would react when she is the one who knows how to bring the humans back!---One theme of the book is belonging. What makes one belong? Wanderer does not think she belongs in the cave because she is not human. Many of the humans agree. But she becomes part of the community, and her friends, who have gotten to know her and thus care about her, believe she belongs. Jeb never calls her ‘it’, and as the others get to know her they stop doing this. Lacey is instantly accepted by many of the humans because she is human (or becomes human again). But she has a hateful personality, and most of the main characters do not like her. Jeb refers to her as ‘that creature’. So what makes us belong somewhere?---I think the characterization is actually not terrible.Ian, for instance, initially comes off as cruel and violent (he tries to kill her), but he’s just reacting to his world being taken over by beings who want to basically kill all humans. We see that he has the capacity to be kind, to gain perspective, to learn to understand. Granted, it seemed a bit incongruous to go from Killer to Most Compassionate & Loving Person Alive Ever in such a short time, but I'll take what I can get from Meyer.Even Kyle is developed, though it mostly comes up in the end. Initially, he is just the villain of the story, but once Sunny is brought in we see that, yeah, he is rash and selfish and arrogant and angry, but he can be gentle and kind. And we don’t see this 180 done on his character where all of a sudden, out of the blue, he is capable of love. We know he had a girlfriend before this all started. Someone, at some point, must have seen some good stuff in him. And his grief at losing his world is manifest through anger and violence towards those who destroyed it. Sunny looks at him as her protector, but he doesn’t jump into a relationship with Sunny. He wants Jodi back. But through his interactions with Sunny, he gains understanding. He is confused by her reaction to initially meeting him and is surprised he can be so kind to her. He is compassionate when she realizes what is going to happen and is terrified, he didn’t realize it would be that hard. Once Jodi doesn’t come back, he has Sunny put back in her body, and he takes care of her. But he’s confused by it all; he doesn’t know what he’s doing or how to have a relationship with her. As shocked as I am by this, Meyer is able to create a character that grows but still remains himself.---I did have a problem with the ending. It’s just too neat and happy. While I was amused and pleased that Jared held a knife to Doc to get him to save Wanderer, it’s way too pat of an ending. Of course, you knew it would happen from the beginning, but I have to wonder whether it would be a better ending to just let her die. She’s lived, she’s learned, it’s her time to go. Life and love go on even in the face of death, as Meyer reminds us numerous times. Show us how the humans cope, how they do on their own once she’s gone. Of course, she is the main character of the book, so maybe allowing her to continue learning how to be human is not such a bad thing. And we know how Meyer hates making her characters suffer any type of consequence...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1656001.The_Host
The Road;Cormac McCarthy;2006;2000;241;3.99;933973;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Horror', 'Literature', 'Novels'];"A searing, postapocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece.A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, “each the other’s world entire,” are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.";"The Road is unsteady and repetitive--now aping Melville, now Hemingway--but it is less a seamless blend than a reanimated corpse: sewn together from dead parts into a lumbering, incongruous whole, then jolted to ignoble half-life by McCarthy’s grand reputation with Hollywood Filmmakers and incestuous award committees.In '96, NYU Professor Alan Sokal submitted a paper for publication to several scientific journals. He made it so complex and full of jargon the average person wouldn't be able to make heads or tails of it. He wrote a conclusion that would deliberately flatter the preconceptions of the journals he submitted it to. As he predicted, it was accepted and published, despite the fact that it was all complete nonsense.The Sokal Affair showed the utter incompetence of these trusted judges. They were unable to recognize good (or bad) arguments and were mostly motivated by politics. The accolades showered upon works like The Road have convinced me that the judges of literature are just as incompetent (and I’m not the only one who thinks so). Unlike Sokol, McCarthy didn't do it purposefully, he just writes in an ostentatiously empty style which is safe and convenient to praise.Many have lauded his straightforward prose, and though I am not the most devoted fan of Hemingway, I can admire the precision and economy of a deliberate, economical use of words. Yet that was not what I got from The Road:
""He took out the plastic bottle of water and unscrewed the cap and held it out and the boy came and took it and stood drinking. He lowered the bottle and got his breath and he sat in the road and crossed his legs and drank again. Then he handed the bottle back and the man drank and screwed the cap back on and rummaged through the pack. The ate a can of white beans, passing it between them, and he threw the empty tin into the woods.Then they set out down the road again.""
Simple? Yes. Precise and purposeful? Hrdlt. The Road is as elegant as a laundry list (if not as well punctuated). Compiling a long and redundant series of unnecessary descriptions is not straightforward, but needlessly complicated.We're supposed to find this simplicity profound--that old postmodern game of defamiliarization, making the old seem new, showing the importance of everyday events--but McCarthy isn't actually changing the context, he's just restating. There is no personality in it, no relationship to the plot, no revealing of the characters. Perhaps it is meant to show their weariness: they cannot even muster enough energy to participate in their own lives, but is the best way to demonstrate boredom to write paragraphs that bore the reader? A good writer can make the mundane seem remarkable, but The Road is too bare to be beautiful, and too pointless to be poignant.Once we have been lulled by long redundancy, McCarthy abruptly switches gears, moving from the plainness of Hemingway to the florid, overwrought figurative language of Melville:
""The man thought he seemed some sad and solitary changeling child announcing the arrival of a traveling spectacle in shire and village who does not know that behind him the players have all been carried off by wolves.""
There is no attempt to bridge the two styles, they are forced to cohabitate, without rhyme or reason to unite them. In another sentence he describes 'dead ivy', 'dead grass' and 'dead trees' with unerring monotony, and then as if adding a punchline, declares them 'shrouded in a carbon fog'--which sounds like the world's blandest cyberpunk anthology.Another example:
""It's snowing, the boy said. A single gray flake sifting down. He caught it in his hand and watched it expire like the last host of christendom.""
McCarthy seems to be trying to reproduce the morbid religious symbolism of Melville when he plays the tattered prophet in Moby Dick. But while Melville's theology is terribly sublime and pervasive, McCarthy's is ostentatious and diminutive, like a carved molding in an otherwise unadorned room. Nowhere does he produce the staggeringly surreal otherworldliness Melville achieves in a line like ""There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within"".Often, McCarthy's gilded metaphors are piled, one atop the other, in what must be an attempt to develop an original voice, but which usually sounds more like the contents of a ‘Team Edward’ notebook, left behind after poetry class:
"". . . Query: How does the never to be differ from what never was?Dark of the invisible moon. The nights now only slightly less black. By day the banished sun circles the earth like a grieving mother with a lamp.People sitting on the sidewalk in the dawn half immolate and smoking in their clothes. Like failed sectarian suicides. . . .""
I love how he prefaces that like an Asimov robot. Sardonic Observation: I'd almost believe he was one, since he has no understanding of beauty or human emotion. Biting Quip: However, he violates Asimov's first law, since his awkward prose harms human ears.Sometimes, smack in the middle of a detailed description of scraping paint with a screwdriver, we suddenly get a complex jargon term which few readers would understand. These terms are neither part of the world, nor are they aspects of specialized character knowledge, so I cannot assign them any meaning in the text.One of the basic lessons for any beginning writer is 'don't just add big words because you can', it's self-indulgent and doesn't really help the story. It would be one thing if it were a part of some stylistic structure instead of bits of out-of-place jargon that conflict with the overall style of the book--more textual flotsam for us to wade through.The longer I read, the more mirthlessly dire it became, and the less I found I could take it seriously. Every little cluster of sentences left on its own as a standalone chapter, every little two-word incomplete sentence trying to demand importance because it actually had punctuation (a rare commodity), every undifferentiated monosyllabic piece of non-dialogue like a hobo talking to himself--it all made the book overblown and nonsensical.It just stared me down, like a huge drunk guy in a bar daring me to laugh at his misspelled tattoo. And I did. I don't know if my coworkers or the people on the bus knew what 'The Road' was about (it was years before the movie), but they had to assume it was one hilarious road, with a busfull of nuns hiding a convict in disguise on the run from a bumbling southern sheriff and his deputy; a donkey is involved.Without mentioning specifics, I will say the notorious ending of the book is completely tacked on, in no way fits with or concludes any of the emotional build of the book, but instead wraps up, neat and tight. It certainly bears out McCarthy's admission on Oprah that he ""had no idea where it was going"" when he wrote it. We can tell, Cormac.As you may have noticed from the quotes, another notorious issue is the way the book is punctuated, which is to say, it isn't. The most complex mark is the a rare comma. It's not like McCarthy is only using simple, straightforward sentences, either---he fills up on conjoined clauses and partial sentence fragments, he just doesn't bother to mark any of them.He also doesn't use any quotes in the books, and rarely attributes statements to characters, so we must first try to figure out if someone is talking, or if it's just another snatch of 'poetic license', and then determine who is talking. Sure, Melville did away with quotes in one chapter in Moby Dick, but he did it in stylistic reference to Shakespeare, and he also seemed to be aware that it was a silly affectation best suited to a ridiculous scene.It's not only the structure, grammar, figurative language, and basic descriptions which are so absurdly lacking: the characters are likewise flat, dull, and repetitive. Almost every conversation between the father and son is the same:
Father: Do it now.Son: I'm scared.Father: Just do it.Son: Are we going to die?Father: No.Son: Are you sure?Father: Yes.
Remember, you won't get little tags so you know who's speaking, it'll all just be strung out in a line without differentiation. Then they wander around for a bit or run from crazy people, and we finally get the cap to the conversation:
Son: Why did (terrible thing) just happen?Father: (Stares off in silence)Son: Why did (terrible thing) just happen?Father: (More silence)
And that’s it, the whole relationship; it never changes or grows. Nor does it seem to make much sense. The characters are always together, each the other's sole companion: father and son, and yet they are constantly distant and at odds, like a suburban parent and child who rarely see each other and have little in common. McCarthy never demonstrates how such a disconnect arose between two people who are constantly intimate and reliant on one another.But then, McCarthy confided to Oprah that the is book about his relationship with his own son, so it makes sense why the emotional content is completely at odds with the setting. Perhaps he just sat down one say and thought “I’m an award-winning author and screenwriter who has a somewhat distant relationship with my son. You know what that’s like? That’s like the unendurable physical suffering of people in the third world who are trying to find food and escape crazed, murderous mobs.” So then he wrote a book equating the two, which is about the most callous, egotistical act of privileged self-pity a writer can indulge in.At least now I know why the characters and their reactions don’t make much sense. The boy is constantly terrified, and his chief role involves pointing at things and screaming, punctuating every conflict in the book, like a bad horror film. Cannibals and dead infants are an okay (if cliche) place to start when it comes to unsettling the reader, but just having the characters react histrionically does not build tension, especially when the characters are too flat to be sympathetic in the first place. Another Creative Writing 101 lesson: if you have to resort to over-the-top character reactions to let the audience know how they are supposed to feel, then your 'emotional moment' isn't working. It's the literary equivalent of a laugh track.You know what’s more unsettling than a child screaming when he finds a dead infant? A child not screaming when he finds a dead infant. And really, that’s the more likely outcome. The young boy has never known another world--his world is death and horror. Anyone who has seen a picture of a Rwandan boy with an AK can see how children adapt to what’s around them. And you know what would make a great book? A father who remembers the old world trying to prevent his son from becoming a callous monster because of the new one.But no, we get a child who inexplicably reacts as if he’s used to the good life in suburbia and all this death and killing is completely new to him, even though we’ve watched him go through it half a dozen times already. The characters never grow numb to it, they never seem to suffer PTSD, their reactions are more akin to angst.Every time there is a problem, the characters just fold in on themselves and give up. People really only do that when they have the luxury of sitting about and ruminating on what troubles them. When there is a sudden danger before us, we might run, or freeze, but there’s hardly time to feel sorry for ourselves.There is no joy or hope in this book--not even the fleeting, false kind. Everything is constantly bleak. Yet human beings in stressful, dangerous situations always find ways to carry on: small victories, justifications, or even lies and delusions. The closest this book gets is ‘The Fire’, which is the father’s term for why they must carry on through all these difficulties. But replace ‘The Fire’ with ‘The Plot’ and you’ll see what effect is achieved: it’s not character psychology, but authorial convenience. Apparently, McCarthy cannot even think of a plausible reason why human beings would want to survive.There is nothing engaging about a world sterilized of all possibility. People always create a way out, even when there is none. What is tragic is not a lack of hope, but misplaced hope. I could perhaps appreciate a completely empty world as a writing exercise, but as McCarthy is constantly trying to provoke emotional reactions, he cannot have been going for utter bleakness. The Road is a canvas painted black, so it doesn't mater how many more black strokes he layers on top: they will not stand out because there is no contrast, there is no depth, no breaking or building of tension, just a constant addition of featureless details to a featureless whole. Some people seem to think that an emotionally manipulative book that makes people cry is better than one that makes people horny--but at least people don’t get self-righteous about what turns them on.This is tragedy porn. Suburban malaise is equated with the most remote and terrible examples of human pain. So, dull housewives can read it and think ‘yes, my ennui is just like a child who stumbles across a corpse’, and perhaps she will cry, and feel justified in doing so. Or a man might read it and think ‘yes, my father was distant, and it makes me feel like I live alone in a hostile world I don’t care to understand’; he will not cry, but he will say that he did.And so the privileged can read about how their pain is the same as the pain of those starving children they mute during commercial breaks. In the perversity of modern, invisible colonialism--where a slave does not wash your clothes, but builds the machine that washes them--these self-absorbed people who have never starved or had their lives imperiled can think of themselves as worldly, as ‘one with humanity’, as good, caring people.They recycle. They turn the water off when they brush their teeth. They buy organic. They even thought about joining the Peace Corps. Their guilt is assuaged. They are free to bask in their own radiant anguish.And it all depresses me--which makes me a shit, because I’m no more entitled to it than any other well-fed, educated winner of the genetic lottery. So when I read this book, I couldn’t sympathize with that angst and think it justified, just like I couldn’t with Holden’s. I know my little existential crisis isn’t comparable to someone who has really lost control of their life, who might actually lose life.But this kind of egotistical detachment has become typical of American thought, and of American authors, whose little, personal, insular explorations don't even pretend to look at the larger world. Indeed, there is a self-satisfied notion that trying to look at the world sullies the pure artist.And that 'emotionally pure, isolated author' is what we get from the Oprah interview. Sure, she's asking asinine questions, but McCarthy shows no capacity to discuss either craft or ideas, refusing to take open-ended questions and discuss writing, he instead laughs condescendingly and shrugs. Then again, he may honestly not have much insight on the topic.Looked at in this way, it's not surprising he won the Pulitzer. Awards committees run on politics, and choosing McCarthy is a political decision--an attempt to declare that insular, American arrogance is somehow still relevant. But the world seems content to move ahead without America and its literature, which is why no one expects McCarthy--or any American author--to win a Nobel any time soon.This book is a paean to the obliviousness of American self-importance in our increasingly global, undifferentiated world. One way or the other, it will stand as a testament to the last gasp of a dying philosophy: either we will collapse under our own in-fighting and short-sightedness, or we will be forced to evolve into something new and competitive--a bloated reputation will carry you only so far.But then, the Pulitzer committee is renowned for picking unadventurous winners--usually an unremarkable late entry by an author past their prime. As William Gass put it:
""the prize is simply not given to work of the first rank, rarely even to the second; and if you believed yourself to be a writer of that eminence, you are now assured of being over the hill""
To any genre reader, this book will have a familiar and unpleasant taste, the same one LeGuin has often lamented: that of the big name author slumming. They pop into fantasy or sci fi with their lit fic credentials to show us little folk 'how it's really done'--but know nothing about the genre or its history, and just end up reinventing the wheel, producing a book that would have been tired and dated thirty years ago. Luckily for such writers, none of their lit fic critics know anything about other genres--any sort of bland rehash will feel fresh to them, as long as you have the name-recognition to get them to look in the first place.So, McCarthy gets two stars for a passable (if cliche) script for a sci fi adventure movie, minus one star for unconscionable denigration of human suffering. I couldn't say if McCarthy's other books are any good; I will probably try another, just to see if any part of his reputation is deserved, but this one certainly didn't help. All I see is another author who got too big for his editors and, finding himself free to write whatever he wanted--only proved that he no longer has anything worth saying.
""Look, if the contemporary condition is hopelessly shitty, insipid, materialistic, emotionally retarded, sadomasochistic, and stupid, then I (or any writer) can get away with slapping together stories with characters who are stupid, vapid, emotionally retarded, which is easy, because these sorts of characters require no development. With descriptions that are merely lists ... Where stupid people say insipid stuff to each other. If what's always distinguished bad writing--flat characters, a narrative world that's ... not recognizably human, etc.--is also a description of today's world, then bad writing becomes an ingenious mimesis of a bad world ... most of us agree that these are dark times, and stupid ones, but do we need fiction that does nothing but dramatize how dark and stupid everything is?""-David Foster Wallace";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6288.The_Road
Never Let Me Go;Kazuo Ishiguro;2005;2000;288;3.85;728804;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Romance', 'Classics'];Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.;"Let me start by saying that my review might contain some plot spoilers. However I personally don't think that knowing the plot in advance will in any way diminish the enjoyment of this story. The beauty of this book is not in the plot, but in its execution.Another friendly warning: Never Let Me Go is for some reason often classified as science fiction. This is why so many readers end up disappointed I think. This novel is literary fiction at its finest. So if you look down on literary fiction and consider books written by authors like Ian McEwan, Margaret Atwood, and Jose Saramago pretentious, this is not a story for you.Now to the novel itself. Kathy, now 31, is a former student of an English boarding school Hailsham. Hailsham is a school for kids with special purpose. All education in this school is geared towards conditioning its student to accept their ""special"" destiny as a given. As Kathy is getting ready to make her first donation while being a carer for other donors, she recounts her life in Hailsham and on her own, mostly in a form of anecdotes about herself and her best friends Ruth and Tommy, their rivalries, jealousies, and affection for each other. There is nothing particularly shocking, gruesome, or intense about Kathy's story, and yet it leaves you with a sense of being a part of a nightmare.After reading quite a few reviews of the book, I can say that I loved the aspects of it that many abhorred. What other readers say about Kathy - her detachment, her lack of fire and rebellion, about broke my heart. What can be more heartbreaking than witnessing human lives wasted? Let me tell you - witnessing lives taken away from people who do not even realize what is being taken away from them, people who do not understand the value of their existence, people who do not know they have a right for more. There is of course, much more to the story. The novel explores the futility of human life, its un-bargainable eventual ""completion"" and how we all choose to deal with the inevitable end. But for me personally the pain of Kathy's quiet resignation to her fate was what stood out and touched me the most.In many ways Never Let Me Go reminded me of The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood. Only Kathy is a step further from Offred. If Offred knows what horrors she is subjected to, but has no strength or will to change her circumstances, Kathy doesn't even know that her life ""purpose,"" her destiny is inhumane. This work is also, to me, very reminiscent of Ian McEwan's Atonement. McEwan is a master of subtle build-up to an almost unbearable, life-shattering moment, but Ishiguro is a master of subtle telling without telling, foreshadowing, and emphasizing the gravity of the unsaid. What else can I say about this novel? Never Let Me Go is a masterfully written work of fiction which raises questions of what it is to be human, what you choose to do in the face of an impending death and what happens when science is not accompanied by ethics. Subtle, eerie, chilling, and poignant. One of the best books I have read this year.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6334.Never_Let_Me_Go
Deception Point;Dan       Brown;2001;2000;556;3.76;677112;no;['Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Suspense', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Adventure', 'Science Fiction'];A shocking scientific discovery.

Uglies;Scott Westerfeld;2005;2000;425;3.85;674555;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Teen'];Tally is about to turn sixteen, and she can't wait. In just a few weeks she'll have the operation that will turn her from a repellent ugly into a stunning pretty. And as a pretty, she'll be catapulted into a high-tech paradise where her only job is to have fun.But Tally's new friend Shay isn't sure she wants to become a pretty. When Shay runs away, Tally learns about a whole new side of the pretty world—and it isn't very pretty. The authorities offer Tally a choice: find her friend and turn her in, or never turn pretty at all. Tally's choice will change her world forever....;"I need to never run into Scott Westerfeld down a dark alley, or during a Civil War reenactment, or at Charlton Heston's house, or wherever. My deep desire not to be arrested for murder would have an epic battle with my need to reach for a weapon when I see his stupid face. In all fairness, as you see, I coughed up three stars for this book, so I will clarify that my empty threatening is really directed toward Pretties and Specials (books two and three in this series). I'm posting this review on the link for the first book in the hopes that it will inspire people to put this book on their list of books never to read. If you read this book there is the danger that you may want to continue with the series, but trust me, you 
really
 don't.In listing what I don't like about this series, I'll start with EVERYTHING from the characters to the plot to the worldview that I imagine would inspire a story of this kind of depth and breadth of ambivalence. The premise of Uglies is that in the future when kids reach puberty, they all have mandatory plastic surgery to turn their bodies into a perfect standard of beauty based on human brain reactions to visual stimulus. Unfortunately (and this is a slight spoiler, so my apologies, but it really is an element that is pretty obvious from page one, though not clearly stated until later), when the kids are having the surgeries to make them pretty, the surgeons change their brains, too, to determine their decision-making abilities, capacity for independent thought, and even sense response. Basically, the pretty surgery makes most people stupid, unless the occupation that the government determines for them requires intelligence. So far so good - it's your basic government-takeover dystopia. Yes, kids, if you let the government give you free health care checkups, it's only a small step to the day they start chopping up your brain.Luckily, said ugly teens (particularly our protagonist, Tally, through her bff, Shay) discover that if they flee to the wilderness, they will be able to live a life of freedom and romance. Oh, what's that? Did I say ""romance""? Thanks again Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ralph Waldo Emerson, et al. Sometimes when characters go out into the wilderness . . . I don't even know. Does the phrase ""it's been done"" even begin to cover my feelings on that topic? Thus begins the cat-fight between Tally and Shay that is the uniting thread of this entire series. You see, there is a wilderness boy (imagine my surprise), who is quite a catch even though he's ""ugly"", and there's some jealousy and betrayal and kick-ass hoverboarding. You get the idea.Let me clarify the problems I have listed so far:1. Suspicion of the city, using a retreat to the wild as the solution to social ills. It's a tired premise.2. Cattiness of the female protagonist and portraying the central female character as mostly driven by her current crush and competition with other women. That is a huge pet peeve of mine.Those, however, are small, forgivable wrongs compared to the basic disingenuousness of the moral arguments Westerfeld makes. While he on one level criticizes the idea of basing society on a hierarchy of physical looks, the characters repeatedly interact within that hierarchy, calling each other ""pretty"" and ""ugly"" at every turn and defining ""pretty"" people very specifically. Even the repetition of the words ""ugly"" and ""pretty"" undercuts any message Westerfeld might have against pigeonholing people. I found myself seeing people in the grocery store and evaluating whether they met the ""evolutionary definition"" of pretty as according to this series. It's creepy and annoying. Westerfeld can be as showy as he wants about how it is limiting to judge people based on their appearance, but I argue that he is actually encouraging that same shallow judgment if only by instruction and repetition. For example, it's like saying, ""kids, don't shoplift, but here's how to shoplift if you ever want to do it. And here's a catchy shoplifting song to sing with your group of friends, who really should have a name. Hey, we could call you guys the 'shoplifting gang'! Don't shoplift, though."" What's the real message there? Ultimately, the arguments of the government that requires the pretty surgeries, also, make a lot of sense in the stories. The surgeries solve anorexia, bring world peace, and save the environment. Plastic surgery sounds fun, too, and Westerfeld literally makes no compelling arguments against body alteration. At the same time, I'm left feeling that Westerfeld thinks it is a bad idea, though he is not convincing.If Westerfeld's discussion of body image wasn't enough of a travesty, the point in this series where this backwards arguing makes me want to wipe him off the face of the planet is when he introduces cutting. By ""cutting"" I'm not talking about skipping school. If you are not familiar with cutting, it is a form of self-mutilation that has been growing in popularity with teenagers over the past few years (I'm going to go ahead and say it's been growing in popularity since 2006, when the book Specials was published). In Specials, our catty female protagonist and her buddies discover that by slicing up their arms, they experience a particularly satisfying high, and all of their senses are strengthened. Ultimately, they randomly decide that this is a bad idea, but Westerfeld only implies their reasoning for that decision, and again I'm left with the feeling that probably everyone should be a cutter because in the context of the story it's pretty badass. I think that was the point where I started yelling and throwing things around my house.Unfortunately, some parts of these stories are actually engaging (not seriously engaging, but passably), and for a while I wanted to find out what happened to everyone, even while I wanted to burn the author's house down. The truly unforgivable wrongs are his wolf-in-sheep's-clothing discussions of teen body image and self-mutilation issues. His characters never develop deep self-respect or intelligent motivation for their actions, and even when their decisions seem healthy, Westerfeld makes a better argument for the unhealthy decisions. Now I realize that I didn't even talk about the uber-annoying slang language he develops for the Pretties and Specials. I'll just say that these books are not ""bubbly"" and leave it at that.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24770.Uglies
World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War;Max Brooks;2006;2000;342;4.02;535421;yes;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Zombies', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Audiobook'];"The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.";"This book was initially recommended to me by several people in the office and since I love zombies and apocalyptic themes, well, I was pretty excited. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations and I struggled to finish it. (I'm going to write this review under the assumption that the reader has some inkling about the story and how it's constructed.)There are two issues that killed it for me. Firstly, most of the characters had the same--or similar--voice. Of course this is partly to do with the fact that the voices all originate from the mind of one individual, the author. Also, the more journalistic/interview approach to constructing the narrative limits how much color the author can impart on any given character. Q and A is inherently dry, no matter how exciting the events described are intended to be. This is a minor gripe, though, and one that can be lived with.A more serious complaint, however, is that this book can be seen as completely lacking any and all dramatic tension that a person (or, me) expects from a survival horror-themed story. The primary draw--the zombie war and how humanity survived--is such a compelling hook, but it's told...by the people who survived. As in, past tense, as in we are left with their impressions of things that happened to them. Basically, then, the story devolves into an excercise in basic exposition: ""And then this happened, and then that happened."" And so the author is free to weave his story without any pesky things like character development, story arcs, plotting, and personal details that are shown and not told. It seems to me like an extraordinarily easy (maybe even lazy) way to tell a story. One other minor point: For me, accounts of survival when the victims are real have meaning that allows them to transcend the limitations described above. WW2 Holocaust survivors' accounts, for example, can take your breath away. The difference is, of course, that they were real events that happened to real people. Since all the classic storytelling elements are dispensed with, we're basically left with the author's views on our current world, particularly and naturally, the wars and our culture(s). However, it's my view that there are dozens of books written about these subjects already; books that haven't needed to sex the discussion up with a horde of shambling undead. So, in summary, if I'm going to read an apocalyptic recounting of the end of civilization as we know it, I want to read about people in real time, struggling to survive, not being told how people surivived after it was over. (I realize, though, that it's all a matter of taste, as I know half a dozen people whose views I respect that absolutely loved this book.) :D";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8908.World_War_Z
The Three-Body Problem;Liu Cixin;2006;2000;472;4.08;386541;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'China', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Aliens'];Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion.;"Badly Written and Ill Conceived Science Fiction with a Few Interesting IdeasI'm not sure I read the same book as everyone else. This got lots of four and five star reviews here on Goodreads. Plus, it's been nominated for both Hugo and Nebula awards.As often happens, I'm not with the majority opinion here. I give it two stars.I'm not sure if the problem was the translation, or the original text, or both. (Unfortunately I only have the audio for this, so I can't quote the text here).But I found the writing wooden, the characters two-dimensional cartoonish stick figures, and the audio narration poor. Although most of the characters are academics or intellectuals, the most believable and interesting character turns out to be a coarse and apparently ignorant policeman, She Qiang (nicknamed ""Da Shi"").Most of the characters are cold and unsympathetic. A few of them commit murders for which they seem entirely unremorseful. It's impossible to care about these people.And there are many unbelievable plot developments. For example, Mike Evans, an environmentalist, conveniently inherits his billionaire father's money at just the right time in the plot. I won't say much more about this as it's a spoiler.This might have been acceptable in the early years of science fiction, but now it just seems like a bad novel. As for the science...I'm not a physicist, so I can't really discuss the physics. Evidently, the three body problem has been unsolved by physicists dating back to Newton. So this part has some scientific basis. Also, the stuff about micro circuitry was interesting.But I have worked with computers for many years. The ""human formation computer"" (a computer powered by trained soldiers with colored flags) seems a bit silly to me, although nothing is impossible. I doubt if millions of humans could achieve the required precision. Interestingly, a minor character in the book who is an executive in a software company says the same thing.Also, the author seems preoccupied with social status. And science is held up as an object of worship.Science and technology are important, but I don't think they should be a religion (which in some quarters they seem to have become).Anyway, here's a brief summary. As a young girl, Ye Wenjie, an astrophysicist, witnesses the killing of her father by Cultural Revolution fanatics.She becomes an astrophysicist herself and is recruited for a secret Chinese science/military project, Red Coast. It's years before she learns the true purpose of the project.Meanwhile, many intellectuals are playing a video game (which requires a haptic suit), called ""The Three Body Problem"". The main gamer character, Wang Miao, is a professor of physics specializing in nanotech.It turns out the game and the Red Coast project are connected.They both relate to extraterrestrial life.The game transports the players to the Trisolar Universe, a universe with three suns that really exists.In most respects, Trisolar is behind earth technologically (they are playing out earlier eras in earth history), but in certain respects they are ahead of earth.Trisolar swings between ""chaotic eras"" and ""stable eras"". Both of these last for indeterminate time periods. Hundreds of civilizations there are destroyed by extremes of heat and cold produced by configurations of the three suns. Residents of Trisolar dehydrate themselves to survive chaotic eras.The game's purpose is to spread information about Trisolar among persons of high intellectual capacity and high social standing. Even though Trisolar really exists, the game plays out differently for different players.Anyway, I won't say much more about the story. I don't want to spoil it.If you liked The Martian, you might enjoy this. The focus is technology and science, with the prose, characters, and plot being entirely secondary to the ideas. Isaac Asimov's Foundation was another book where the characters and plot were subordinate to the ideas, although I think it works much better as a novel than this does.I didn't really care for Luke Daniels' audio narration either. His voice varied from leaden in some spots to over-excited in others. And when doing foreign accents, he either exaggerated them, or in some cases, got them wrong. I'd say pass on this one, except that lots of others seem to love it.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem
Under the Dome;Stephen         King;2009;2000;1074;3.92;305579;no;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery', 'Audiobook'];Under the Dome is the story of the small town of Chester's Mill, Maine which is inexplicably and suddenly sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field. No one can get in and no one can get out. When food, electricity and water run short, the normal rules of society are changed. A new and more sinister social order develops, Dale Barbara, a young Iraq veteran, teams up with a handful of intrepid citizens to fight against the corruption that is sweeping through the town and to try to discover the source of the Dome before it is too late...;"Completely out of the blue a clear dome appears over the town of Chester’s Mill, in Maine, of course. A plane crashes into it. A groundhog is sliced in half. A woman gardening in her yard has a hand sheared off. How did this thing get there? Who or what is responsible? How can it be removed? This is not the Stephen King I am used to. I have been a fan since the beginning and have read the vast majority, although not all, of King’s books. For me  Under the Dome kicks it up a notch. Sure there is supernatural creepiness, and an explanation that is, well, disappointing. But this is Stephen King. Duh-uh. If you read the guy for his wonderful denouement explanations you probably shouldn't bother. What makes King so successful is that he writes great characters, draws you in and keeps you there once he has you, while scaring the bejesus out of you often enough to matter. He kept me under his dome for all 1072 pages. The addition to his usual toolkit this time is his expansion to the political. “If I'm going to spend a year writing a single draft of a book, it should be about something.” - from a Barnes & Noble interviewWhich of course begs a question about the value of spending, say half a year. What is the duration of labor at which one must cross over from pure entertainment to something?I've always been a political novelist, and those things have always interested me. Firestarter is a political novel. The Dead Zone is a political novel. There's that scene in The Dead Zone where Johnny Smith sees Greg Stillson in the future starting a nuclear war. Around my house we kinda laugh when Sarah Palin comes on TV, and we say, ""That's Greg Stillson as a woman."" - from an interview in Salon)More scary than funny to me. Well, maybe Dome is not so out of the way for King.But while political commentary has definitely found its way into King’s books, there are few who consider him to be a political author. His other concerns usually take precedence. In Under the Dome he continues a lifelong fascination with small town life. Most of his people have significant secrets. And we get to see their character from how they cope with the stress they experience. The book took a long time to reach its final form. “I started it in 1976, got about 75 pages into it — and then I saw what the scope of the thing was going to be, how many technological issues it raised, and I buckled. I’m not a sci-fi writer; I don’t know a lot about technology, so I thought I’d try again, set it in an apartment building, and then I wouldn’t have to deal with what the weather would be like under a dome. But I didn’t like any of the characters, so I put it away.” - from an interview in Pop MattersHe revisited the story in the 1980s. Renamed “The Cannibals” it still had to do with people isolated in an apartment building. And still avoided having to cope with the technical demands of having the story set under a dome. The inspiration for the reduction in venue was a stay in a less than appealing area of suburban Pittsburgh during the filming of Creepshow. He wrote almost five hundred pages this time, but was still unable to figure out all that he needed to figure out. It was not until the new millennium that the manuscript turned up again. This time he was able to garner the expertise needed to get past his technical roadblocks. He returned to the dome notion and wrote up a storm.What would people do if stuck together, whether under a dome or in an apartment building? Perhaps a less tropical version of William Golding’s classic, with adults gone wild instead of kids and without the beach. Let’s just say that things do not go well, and dark forces, human ones, come to the fore. His boogey man this time is personified by that most iconic totem of dishonesty, a used-car salesman, named Big Jim Rennie. Big Jim may be the Second Selectman in the town of Chester’s Mill, but he is the real power in town. First Selectman Andy Sanders is pretty much a smiling, charming non-entity, content to do whatever Big Jim wants. And the third Selectman is a drug-addicted woman who is reliant on Big Jim and Andy for her supplies. If you might think Big Jim is a stand-in for a certain vice president, you would be right. All the way to his questionable ticker. It might be a stretch to see in Rennie’s son, Junior, a stand-in for Cheney’s activist progeny, but maybe not. If you think Andy might be a stand-in for Dubya, right again, complete with an addiction issue. King sees Bush and Andy not so much as evil as weak, and the portrayal here reflects that. Rennie seemed pretty evil to me, complete with his insanely hypocritical refusal to use or tolerate profanity while behaving as profanely as possible, stealing critical supplies from the hospital, among other places, to support his meth lab, one of the largest in the country. He tells himself he is doing God’s will.“I enjoyed taking the Bush-Cheney dynamic and shrinking it to the small-town level,” he said. “The last administration interested me because of the aura of fundamentalist religion that surrounded it and the rather amazing incompetency of those top two guys. I thought there was something blackly humorous in it. So in a sense, ‘Under the Dome’ is an apocalyptic version of ‘The Peter Principle.’ ” from a NY Times interviewExpanding on his Cheney/Bush analogy, he goes through a list of items one can associate not only with that dynamic duo but with others throughout history who have used crisis as a way to consolidate power, fomenting discord by sponsoring provocative and secretive actions (think Reichstag fire) as a way to cast blame on enemies, raising a private army (whether in 1930s Germany or contemporary Blackwater, sorry, Xe), planning to massacre one’s opponents (back to the funny moustache guy again), spying on one’s own citizens (see Patriot Act), controlling or at least monitoring communications (ditto), attempting to destroy opposing media, and so on. No one actually says “Kill the Pig” but if asked to, some would. It is certainly no coincidence that the evildoers here go after a truth-telling newspaper named The Democrat. There is also a countervailing force, the Jack of this scenario, although he has a name that sounds incongruous here. Dale Barbara, known as Barbie, is an ex-military wanderer, last employed at the local diner, someone who does all he can to avoid conflict, but like a certain Corleone, keeps getting dragged back.It is interesting that the hero here is a reluctant military guy and the baddies are both civilians and cops. Note also that the honest reporter is a Republican.Keeping a hand in with supernatural elements, some town residents, particularly children, have premonitions, visions of unpleasant events to come. Gee, do ya think they might?King keeps the action moving, and all the while gives us characters we can care about, warts and all. That is his greatest talent. Don’t worry about the explanation for the dome. It is the reactions of the people contained within it that matter. The Dome itself could have come out of a mystical cracker jack box. While it might have been no fun for the residents of Chester’s Mill to be stuck with each other for so long, it is no chore to keep an eye on them for all 1,072 pages, through a dome, darkly.My favorite review nugget comes from Charles Taylor, in a review for BarnesandNobleReview.com.

Then, of his own volition while walking through the hallway, he'd pulled it off the shelf, sat down, and started to read it again.That's a recommendation beyond anything I can give it. * * *About a week ago, I went on a car trip with Oot, and we listened to this book together. I see why he liked it. It's very tightly written. Good setting. Good mystery. Two POV characters, one boy and one girl. They each have their own plots, and their own character arcs. Their own problems they struggle to resolve. The boy gets angry sometimes, and his father talks to him about it, and the boy tries throughout the book to get a grip on his anger with varying success. What's more, they both make mistakes. And they're *obviously* mistakes. If only the boy would have told his father about X, things would have gone better. It's kinda the opposite of Harry Potter. It's nice to have that in a kid's book.Anyway. Yeah. Good book. Good Audio. Two thumbs up. One from me, and one from Oot.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/307791.The_City_of_Ember

Now, you're contributing to the local economy and not giving money to the giant food corporations that are trying to push small farms out of business. . . but you're still driving all over to buy the shit, and burning through petroleum like a motherfucker. Face it: when it comes to the continuity of life on this planet, you are a pest. You're the renegade cell, eating away at all of the nice and friendly cells around you. I know I'm not telling you anything new right now: you've seen The Matrix, you've heard about overpopulation, global warming, oil spills and you know how totally, absolutely fucked polar bears are right now, but it's always been like that ever since you were born, and we keep coming up with new sciences, so inevitably something will come up to save the day, right? We'll take some polar bear DNA and store it, and once we're all caught up with Jurassic Park technologies, we'll bring 'em back. And, by the time we get to there, we'll be able to stop raising cows; we can just raise steaks: little flat cows that don't have brains, don't have needs other than maybe watering them and spooning nutrients into their slack mouths, and sea-urchin-like chicken creatures without any minds that we can make into chicken fingers, and none of them will feel a thing, so there won't be any question, ethically speaking, right? Right?Don't hit me up with your ""playing God"" argument, because that's bullshit. We ""play God"" when we amputate a gangrenous leg, when we remove a tumor, when we brush our fucking teeth. So, what is really wrong with growing steaks in soil, and not raising cows in huge concentration camps where they hang out in their own shit all day? What's wrong with doing away with coffins, and simply mulching our loved ones? They're going in the dirt either way.If we're being utilitarian, is our urchin-chicken happier or less happy than our chicken in a lightless pen with ridiculous pecs so oversized his legs are broken? What about the chicken who has gone mad and is now pecking other chickens to death? Probably urchin-chicken. I'm just saying. That said, I wouldn't eat urchin-chicken, if I wanted to go out on a limb and say a company would be required to even TELL me the product I was buying was urchin: ""Warning: this product is made from something that tastes like, but isn't, a chicken."" They don't tell me when my steaks are cloned, or through what fucked up chemical reactions they've made my food, so I have my doubts. What's wrong with growing a mindless food animal, much the way we grow corn or rice or soy? What's wrong with growing mindless clones of ourselves, just for the purpose of harvesting their organs? This would be an easier question to answer if I wasn't an atheist, and I could quote an instruction book, but I can't. I have to answer the question, and I'll give an answer that Atwood kinda-does-but-doesn't: we don't know what will happen. We didn't know sea walls would increase erosion in other parts of the river when we first started building them. We didn't know that lighthouses would kill tons and tons of birds because birds fly toward the light. We didn't know that carbon emissions could be a problem until we'd flooded tons of them off into the atmosphere. So, why shouldn't we use science to make the world cater to our every desire and impulse? Because we can't even predict the weather. ********Oh, you want me to talk about the book? Yeah, I guess I could do that. As you can tell by my meta-review, this one gets the gears in your head turning. But, the characters were all flat and, although full of potential, ended up dull. The post-apocalyptic world we're reading about is intriguing, as are the new creatures that have replaced humans. The bizarre, freakish animals created by science are also perfectly horrific. That said, some of this feels like a pretty big stretch. According to Atwood, we'll eventually be desensitized enough that we'll enjoy watching people tortured to death online, and we'll also like watching little children having sex with grown men. And I'm not talking about in a ""2 girls 1 cup,"" watch-it-once-because-it-sounds-fucked-up way. . I mean, she imagines people will sit around watching this shit all the time. Perhaps I'm a prude, but I don't think either of these will ever become popular with more than a small audience. My cynicism only goes so far, I guess. Far as dystopias go, this is an interesting and unusual one. It's also an entertaining and quick read. I wish Atwood would've invested a bit more time in filling out these characters, and given us a five-star book instead. . . but nobody bats 100%. I'm looking forward to trying some of her non-science fictiony works soon.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46756.Oryx_and_Crake

Cloud Atlas;David Mitchell;2004;2000;509;4.01;253167;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary'];"A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.But the story doesn’t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.";"This book proves David Mitchell can be any writer he chooses. The six novellas that comprise Cloud Atlas are forgeries - and they are original. Each adopts the voice of a distinct author. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, but all of the parts are superb. It is a sextet, like the one found within the novel, with piano, clarinet, cello, flute, oboe, and violin - every individual instrument pleasing, but when played altogether becomes something different and brilliant - the Cloud Atlas Sextet.Each novella is broken, torn in two, or interrupted, and later continued after the sixth, which is the only one completed in one section. Then the previous five stories are concluded in descending order. 1. THE PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ADAM EWINGWritten as a journal. The first story is a delightful combination of Melville, Defoe, and James Fenimore Cooper. It has the serious tone and charm of 18th and 19th century literature, but goes a bit too far, just short of mockery. It is not parody, nor disrespectful. Somehow it has a layer of - what? invisible mirth? The acknowledgments notes Michael King’s definitive work on the Moriori, 
A Land Apart: The Chatham Islands Of New Zealand
 which provided Mitchell with a factual account of Chatham Islands history. This part of the story is interesting, and adds historical details essential to the plot in the way  Moby Dick  does with whaling information.Moriori, 1877, survivors of the 1835 Maori invasion2. LETTERS FROM ZEDELGHEMLetters, one way. Robert Frobisher, writes amusing accounts of his escapades in Belgium to his lover Rufus Sixsmith while he works for a famous composer as an amanuensis. I pictured Frobisher to be like a young Hugh Laurie. There is something of Waugh, or Nancy Mitford in style and humour. He finds the Adam Ewing journal. The acknowledgments notes ""certain scenes in Robert Frobisher’s letters owe debts of inspiration to 
Delius as I Knew Him
 by Eric Fenby....The character Vyvyan Ayrs quotes Nietzsche more freely than he admits."" And like Nietzsche, Ayrs has tertiary syphilis, ""The syphilitic decays in increments, like fruit rotting in orchard verges"". ""Eric William Fenby, OBE (22 April 1906 – 18 February 1997) was an English composer and teacher who is best known for being Frederick Delius's amanuensis from 1928 to 1934. He helped Delius realise a number of works that would not otherwise have been forthcoming...In 1928, hearing that Delius had become virtually helpless because of blindness and paralysis due to syphilis, he offered to serve him as an amanuensis."" -  Wikipedia  ""Delius, Delius amat, Syphilus, Deus, Genius, ooh"". -  Kate Bush

3. HALF-LIVES, THE FIRST LUISA REY MYSTERY It's terrible! in a good way. A classic thriller/mystery/crime novel. Cheesy style and plot: spunky girl reporter, whose father (Lester Rey, now dead) had been a cop fighting corruption. Several highly improbable escapes from certain death. All the clichés of this genre are here and brilliantly strung together. Rufus Sixsmith, the addressee in the previous episode, is a key character and his letters from Zedelghem are discovered after he is murdered.

4. THE GHASTLY ORDEAL OF TIMOTHY CAVENDISHThe memoir of a sixty something publishing agent, trapped in an old folks home. Cavendish is like an acid-tongued old geezer Randle McMurphy, battling another Nurse Ratched - but as written by Martin Amis. He reads the manuscript for Half-Lives, intending to publish it, as well as his own memoir, ""I shall find a hungry ghostwriter to turn these notes you’ve been reading into a film script of my own.""Nursey5.

SLOOSHA’S CROSSIN’ AN’ EV’RYTHIN’ AFTER	  Futurist speculative fiction - civilization has fallen, the few remaining people live a basic existence. Sort of a Tolkienian fantasy but Mitchell's marvelous invented dialect is Burgessish. Zachry the goatherder - there and back again - is a Valleysman on Big I, Ha-Why. ""Valleysmen only had one god an’ her name it was Sonmi"".Zachry sees a recording of Sonmi's Q & A interview, because there is a small group of advanced survivors, ""Prescients,"" and one arrives on a great ship to live on the island, to learn the ways of these primitive people. They have a Prime Directive - but who ever follows those? They are nonbelievers,We Prescients, she answered, after a beat, b’lief when you die you die an there ain’t no comin back.But what ’bout your soul? I asked.Prescients don’t b’lief souls exist.But ain’t dyin’ terrorsome cold if there ain’t nothin’ after?Yay—she sort o’ laughed but not smilin’, nay— our truth is terror-some cold.Jus’ that once I sorried for her.

Nietzsche, Kipling, Conrad, Zane Grey, Homer. Harry Harrison. And more.One Novella is slyly presented within another. I found myself clinging to the first narrative as the ""real"" one. When it turns up as ""a curious dismembered volume"" in the second, damn! I swallowed hard and justified such an appearance as quite possible. Then it is merely mentioned in a manuscript - the third novella - which is being read in the fourth. Got that? making it entirely illogical to continue my belief. And worse: Frobisher says, ""Something shifty about the journal’s authenticity—seems too structured for a genuine diary, and its language doesn’t ring quite true—but who would bother forging such a journal, and why?"" So I'm forced into using doublethink of the highest order. The fact is, you want each of these narratives to be the real one. They are that good. The structure weakens the reader's fantasy that this is ""real"". It becomes very awkward, like explaining a time travel paradox. Still...never underestimate the power of doublethink. Autua, Adam Ewing, Robert Frobisher, Rufus Sixsmith, Timothy Cavendish, Sonmi, Zachry, Meronym, all remain with me... *Sob*.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49628.Cloud_Atlas
Unwind;Neal Shusterman;2007;2000;337;4.17;234879;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Thriller'];"Connor, Risa, and Lev are running for their lives.The Second Civil War was fought over reproductive rights. The chilling resolution: Life is inviolable from the moment of conception until age thirteen. Between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, however, parents can have their child ""unwound,"" whereby all of the child's organs are transplanted into different donors, so life doesn't technically end. Connor is too difficult for his parents to control. Risa, a ward of the state, is not enough to be kept alive. And Lev is a tithe, a child conceived and raised to be unwound. Together, they may have a chance to escape and to survive.";"I was walking back from my playgroup with my son on Monday, I came out of an elevator to find a teenage boy waiting for me. Fear and an urge to protect my son came over me as he looked a little ""rough"" around the edges.Instead of pulling a knife or picking a fight though, the teenager turned on me with big, embarrassed, doe-eyes to ask in a quivering voice, ""Excuse me, can I please have fifty cents to call my mum?"" I fished out fifty cents worth of coins and left as soon as I saw him head towards the telephone, not waiting around to see if he got through to her. True story.Unwind by Neal Shusterman is a novel about a world gone mad in which children between the ages of thirteen and eighteen can be legally signed over by their parents or guardians to be put through a harvest camp so that others can take their organs, tissue and blood.Abortion is also illegal but people can leave infants on other people's doorstep as a method of ""storking"" and thus legally handing over their responsibilities of the child.A common phrase used throughout this book is, ""Someone else's problem."" This encompasses the spirit of the book and is said often by adults who have had children fall temporarily into their hemisphere and require dealing with. There are very few adults in this book who do more than the bare minimum of what they have to do to sit right in their conscience and there's a whole bevy of others who don't do that much.Connor, one of the trio of main protagonists and an indisputable Christ metaphor, is a ""problem"" child. His parents are at a loss as to how to handle his behavioral problems and his poor grades so they consign him to being unwound. Risa, a ward of the state, is a bed that the government can free up for a child that they can't legally unwind yet and so is also handed over to the harvesting camp. Levi, the last of the trio is a religious tithe by his parents - born and raised to serve God by handing him over to be tithed as part of their duty to the community and God.There are many other such stories in this book from a boy whose loving parents died, leaving him an inheritance that his aunt feels would be better off putting her kids through college once he's been unwound and a boy whose divorcing parents couldn't agree on any custody solution and would rather, literally, divide him.This whole book is about the powerlessness of children in the hands of those who should be responsible for them. It is at times nerve-wracking, heartbreaking, devastating and a complete adrenaline rush.What it is most of all, though, is sad. Sad because the truth is that children are not the problem and they shouldn't be treated like a problem. They are a symptom at worst and a blessing always. They are a gift that requires attention. They are an innocent package and in the case of 99% of them - if they are running around the street as twelve year olds being a menace to society then they have not let us down - we have let them down.I love this book because it is well written, I love this book because it is compelling. I love this book because sometimes it is a hard and challenging read on a personal level. I love this book because it asks you to think. I love this book for the many things it has revealed about me - most of them not positive. I love this book because it is well-written with absorbing characters and a great plot.Most of all, I love this book because next time I come across a kid of the street asking for fifty cents to call his mum, I'll let him borrow my phone and make sure she's coming to get him.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/764347.Unwind
The Angel Experiment;James Patterson;2005;2000;445;4.07;226883;yes;['Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Paranormal', 'Action'];Six unforgettable kids — with no families, no homes — are running for their lives. Max Ride and her best friends have the ability to fly. And that's just the beginning of their amazing powers. But they don't know where they come from, who's hunting them, why they are different from all other humans... and if they're meant to save mankind — or destroy it.;"Now this is a terrible book.Written with all the wit and grace of a one-legged puppy, Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment reveals its intentions within the first chapter alone. This is not a book of striking prose or even serviceable but entertaining MOR lit. It is merely a cash cow, another mindless series designed to appeal to reluctant readers. It is, in a word, soulless.Maximum Ride follows the adventures of six children, each of whom is the product of a genetic experiment: they are 98% human, 2% bird. These characters (each bequeathed with atrocious names that are supposed to be hip - Maximum, Nudge, Iggy, the Gasman, Fang, and Angel) spend 422 pages being chased by ""Erasers"" while trying to discover the secret of the School, the institution responsible for their mutations. 
422 pages
 for what could have been a novella, nay, an essay. The stilted narration, provided by the ""edgy"" Maximum Ride, perhaps one of the most grating heroines in YA literature, is weakened by attempts to provide three-dimensionality to her character through her thoughtful analyses of those around her. Unfortunately, Patterson's creativity as a writer is strictly limited to half-baked and poorly described battle sequences, so Ride's introspection is relegated to heinous platitudes like, ""It was like I had just lost my baby sister. And like I had lost my little girl"" (p.25). (Guess what, Sister Girl... you did.)Because Patterson has made a career out of writing awful books for adults, he has convinced himself that he knows how to write for teens, and, more horribly, like teens. In fact, his writing reads like an old man trying to sound young: ""Angel stared and stared and stared at Jeb Batchelder"" (p. 143) is writing worse than the output of most 2nd graders, and ""Then, in a burst, she leaped up, sprang off the table, and practically crashed through the fire door. The Gasman was practically glued to her back."" (p. 183) makes me practically tired of bad writing.Worse than the one-dimensional characters and the freakishly awful writing are the countless pages devoted entirely to filler. Hundreds of trees could have been saved if Patterson had employed an editor. Here is a sample of go-nowhere events in the book:• The gang sees a concert in Central Park.• The gang enjoys Mrs. Fields' cookies.• Two characters hang out with a bunch of hawks and learn cool flying tricks, all of which occurs while...• ...Maximum spends about 8+ chapters with a family in a subplot that appears to tie into the primary story, but, in fact, does not.• The majority of Chapter 103 is spent enumerating each character's orders in a fancy restaurant in great detail.• Most of the book is devoted to ""to-ing and fro-ing"" - running from one location to another - with the express purpose of supplying a new setting for a battle. The only upside to Maximum Ride is its appeal to reluctant readers... and I'm all for that. Avid readers, however, be warned. This book will take hours of your life that you will never get back.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13152.The_Angel_Experiment
Gone;Michael  Grant;2008;2000;560;3.86;203832;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Paranormal', 'Romance'];In the blink of an eye, everyone disappears. Gone. Except for the young.There are teens, but not one single adult. Just as suddenly, there are no phones, no internet, no television. No way to get help. And no way to figure out what's happened.Hunger threatens. Bullies rule. A sinister creature lurks. Animals are mutating. And the teens themselves are changing, developing new talents—unimaginable, dangerous, deadly powers—that grow stronger by the day. It's a terrifying new world. Sides are being chosen, a fight is shaping up. Townies against rich kids. Bullies against the weak. Powerful against powerless. And time is running out: On your 15th birthday, you disappear just like everyone else...;"I read this book out of curiosity, with no preconceived notions. Merely because I was curious what kids would do in a world with no adults. I admit I was blown away. Mr. Grant told me a story that I couldn't put down. From the beginning, my mind was full of questions about how this happened, how the kids would survive, what could prevent the same thing from happening again....So many questions.Sam is the kind of boy you want to have around when the world goes crazy. He's definitely the reluctant hero type, but usually they come through for you like no other. Because they do what needs to be done, simply because it needs to happen. Not for glory, not for recognition. Sam doesn't want to be 'the guy', but he knows that no one else is going to do it. And when Caine and his posse come down from Coates Academy, taking over and making things mostly worse, someone has to step up to the plate to stop him.This book is intense, violent, and sometimes sad. Some of these kids die. A lot of them get hurt pretty bad. I'm not a mother yet, but I love kids, and I hate to see them suffering. It was a bit painful to watch. Even harder was seeing the cruelty and potential for evil that some of these children showed. Drake, who is basically Caine's bully boy, is a psychopath. He loves hurting people, and he feels no remorse about doing it. In my mind, I was weighing the options, even thinking that they needed to kill him, because he was like a rabid animal, bent on destruction. I felt horrible doing that, but he's a loose cannon, and he's only going to get worse. I don't think saving this boy is an option.One of the take home messages of this book is the consequences of a social structure that is pretty familiar to most of us. The dynamic that we see in a group of kids where there are bullies who find the 'weakest' people and torment then, doing everything they can to make life miserable for those kids. And this causes a lot of fallout, because people forget ethics and what's morally right so that they can have peace from the bullies. In essence, they become part of the problem, contributing to a micro-society in which children get hurt because everyone is afraid to speak up and stand up against the bullies and the ones who are 'running things' for their own twisted, self-absorbed reasons. It made me shudder to see what these children did to each other, because they thought it was the easiest option to keep control of things. I'll be honest. I was bullied and picked on big time. It made me hate seeing the so-called 'weak' or 'different' people get targeted and treated that way. I'm no fighter, but I made a promise that I'd stand up for someone who couldn't do that for his or herself. I was glad that the kids like Sam and Edilio (what a sweetheart) were more than willing to do that.I had some issues with the decisions that were made by the kids. They had no real sanitation rules. They didn't use their resources effectively. They had very poor nutrition, unnecessarily, because there was a supermarket full of healthy things like fruits and vegetables, proteins, grains. They ate mostly junk like candy, ice cream, soda pop, you name it. I guess I was looking at things through 'grown-up' eyes, which did cause me some discomfort. I was glad that they did organize care for the babies and kids too young to watch out for themselves, because Mary and her brother took on that job. I was also glad that Dahra worked as the medical provider. Albert took over the McDonalds and provided food for the community. Even so, I see some problems ahead, unless the kids set up a civic structural system in which every person is accountable (over-thinking this, I know!).I loved the relationship between Astrid and Sam. They had an innocent love but also a strong friendship and support system in which they watched out for each other and did what they could to help everyone through this situation. Astrid was the brain, very smart, but also very kind. She had to take care of her younger brother, who was autistic, and extremely gifted with powers. I'll get to the powers part later. Give me a minute. Not an easy task for a young girl, but she did it. I was rooting for things to work out for these two!Another character who turned out to be a favorite was Lana. Lana is in a very bad position when the 'event' happens--the one in which all the people over fourteen disappear. She ends up getting horribly injured and is about to die, when her power to heal manifests. Oh, I was on the edge of my seat, seeing her stranded, wounded very badly, with only her dog to protect her from the wild animals in the desert. I was so glad that she was able to get out of that situation. Of course, she ends up in a worse situation that ties in with the kids in town, and in a big way, as this book culminates. It might seem like a deus ex-machina to have a character who can heal even the most grievous wounds, but I was glad that she did have the power. These kids have a lot stacked up against them already. They need all the advantages they can get.Now, lets talk about the power. Some of the kids, Sam included, have supernatural abilities that start manifesting. I thought this part was very cool. How Caine approaches this, with his evil little posse' made my hair stand on end. I can't even conceive of children being as cruel as that lot were. The powers end up playing a pivotal role in this story, and I am sure that this will continue to be a very strong element in the forthcoming books. I liked the ""X-Men"" sort of element it brought to the story, and how kids that were often bullied and felt useless, got to play important roles in the fight against Caine and his Posse' of Evil.I wanted to give the author a nod of thanks for making the FAYZ (Fallout Alley Youth Zone) a multicultural environment, with children of all races. Everyone is important, and it was nice to see that there was a rainbow represented here. That speaks highly to me!If you're an adult and you don't think you could enjoy young adult books, this is one I'd recommend. If you're like me, you will be riveted to this exciting story. It has a lot to offer as far as entertainment, but also stimulates the brain, as you are confronted with this bad situation that this young kids have to face. I cannot stop reading these books. I'm way too invested now!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2536134.Gone
Old Man's War;John Scalzi;2005;2000;318;4.23;202680;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'War', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Military Fiction'];"John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army.The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce-- and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine--and what he will become is far stranger.";"This is, for me, a pretty short review as the key novel element here is one that it is fun to discover in the book, and not spoiling that severely limits what I can discuss.I really enjoyed Old Man's War and think you should read it. For me it was a 5* first half and a 3* second half (I liked the 2nd half but it wasn't 5* 'amazing'). Scalzi can write! He opens with excellent characterization, touching and real. This skill at bringing the POV character to life, at catching the vibe of a vital individual grown old and isolated, combines with a great plot hook. It's vivid modern almost literary writing unfolding a fascinating take on future earth.The first half felt modern with a gentle touch on characterization, a fresh idea, diversity, a book of its time. The second half felt more like 60's/70's sci-fi - blasting bad guys in space. EE Doc Smith could have written it. That's by no means a bad thing. I enjoyed it. You may well too. But the transition from a very personal earth-bound story to a space romp didn't quite gell for me.From the ""hard"" scifi point of view this also felt old fashioned in a Star Wars sense. Star Wars serves us WWI biplane aerial combat in the guise of space warfare. X-Wing pilots literally look out of their cockpit windows for the enemy. It's enjoyable nonsense. Old Man's War is similar, serving up a mix between WWI and Trojan war combat for infantry, ignoring much of the current and likely future developments in technology that would radically change this, probably make it redundant (and likely make it much more boring). Think Starship Troopers, where they fly across light years to die in droves machine gunning alien bugs. These minor nits aside, this is a fun, interesting, exciting, funny book. Read it.

The Knife of Never Letting Go;Patrick Ness;2008;2000;512;3.97;196822;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook'];Todd Hewitt is the only boy in a town of men. Ever since the settlers were infected with the Noise germ, Todd can hear everything the men think, and they hear everything he thinks. Todd is just a month away from becoming a man, but in the midst of the cacophony, he knows that the town is hiding something from him -- something so awful Todd is forced to flee with only his dog, whose simple, loyal voice he hears too. With hostile men from the town in pursuit, the two stumble upon a strange and eerily silent creature: a girl. Who is she? Why wasn't she killed by the germ like all the females on New World? Propelled by Todd's gritty narration, readers are in for a white-knuckle journey in which a boy on the cusp of manhood must unlearn everything he knows in order to figure out who he truly is.;"i have 2,410 friends on goodreads.com.199 of them have this book on their shelves.of that number, only 28 have read it.to the other 171 of you, i say - ""WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???"" and you can see i am serious about this, because i have done math in order to convince you.**and i know, i know. there are a lot of books in the world, most of us are mortal, who has the time, etc. i myself had all three of the books in this trilogy just smooshed in the middle of piles of other books at my place, thinking, ""i will read those when i get around to it."" and you may be feeling the same way. so allow me:now you have no more excuses.(LAFFTER!)but seriously, folks. i don't even know where to start with this book. i really thought it was going to be a low-impact tale of a boy's adventure's through a damaged land with some sort of eventual self-discovery and that it would have good action sequences and some obvious metaphors and blah-di-blah and people said it was sad, so i figured someone would die at some point.well.understatement in all of the above.this was much richer and deeper and so very dark. ness touches upon the problems of colonization and group mentality and dehumanization and helplessness and loyalty with a skill for storytelling and characterization, and always skirting that fine line between emotion and sentimentality.it has been awhile since i have been immersed in a book. this world - these characters - it consumed me. it is so hard to talk about books that do this to me. it is easy to pick apart books that are ""good"" or ""okay"" or ""the worst"", but the ones that i fall into - the ones that i hate having to put down for anything as mundane as sleep or work, those are incredibly difficult to put into words. but ""mmmmmm"" comes close.i think todd is a very solid character. there are times when he makes unfortunate decisions, but they always seem consistent in terms of his character, and the background from which he is coming. there is such an opportunity for growth in him, but you know, despite anything that may happen, he is trying to do the right thing, as he sees it; as he is learning what ""the right thing"" even is. i mean, he's twelve-thirteen, right? and he is a lot more resourceful and insightful than i was at that age, and i didn't have to go around hearing everyone's thoughts all the time. oh, did i forget to talk about the plot again? quickly - everyone can hear everyone's thoughts. all the time. even the most mundane, subconscious, or embarrassing ones. even thoughts of animals. but not, however, the thoughts of women. we are still mysterious. todd grows up in an all-male town, but soon will leave and discover... well, he will discover a lot. better you read it than i tell it.aaron is a little...unrealistic,sure, but after a while, you gotta sort of do that horrified slow-clap at his stubbornness and persistence, right? it is impressive, if nothing else.viola. great here. even better in the second book. mmmmmmmmmtalking animals. yeah, i usually don't like it either. however, these animals talk exactly how animals should talk. they don't have conversations; they have a limited vocabulary that seems appropriate, and can be so heartbreaking in certain situations, oh my god. manchee is the best dog in literature. his voice is exactly right. very reminiscent of the dog in up, and although he has a small range of words at his disposal,his emotions come across loud and clear.it is a wonderful relationship, despite todd not wanting a dog and resenting him at the beginning of the book, the two of them, through their adventures, become the best ""boy and his dog"" team i can think of. definitely have the second book on hand to pick up immediately after finishing the first one. you are going to need it. i can't imagine how people reading this when it was new had to suffer - to have to wait for the next book to be published. this is the mother of all cliffhangers. or, at least, it was until i finished the second book yesterday. it is even worse.in terms of agonizingly wonderful cliffhangers. ** although i am looking closer now, and i am realizing that my math is all wrong (i thought those numbers seemed low)- but that this time it is not my fault. when did goodreads.com change things up so that all the reviews are together at the bottom, regardless of whether or not the are reviews by your friends. isn't the whole point of having ""friends"" that you have created this trusted community of readers whose values you respect? now i have to scroll through the three or four people on this site who aren't my friends to see the reviews of people whose opinions matter to me? this is insane! and it isn't even arranged by number of votes or anything - it is just - here are a ton of reviews - have fun finding the useful ones (like this one, surely!) in a sea of stranger danger. i hope this is just a temporary thing that is happening because it is taking one of the strengths specific to goodreads and pooing (""poo, todd!"") all over it.come to my blog!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20758104-the-knife-of-never-letting-go
Gathering Blue;Lois Lowry;2000;2000;240;3.82;196422;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Classics'];In her strongest work to date, Lois Lowry once again creates a mysterious but plausible future world. It is a society ruled by savagery and deceit that shuns and discards the weak. Left orphaned and physically flawed, young Kira faces a frightening, uncertain future. Blessed with an almost magical talent that keeps her alive, she struggles with ever broadening responsibilities in her quest for truth, discovering things that will change her life forever.As she did in The Giver, Lowry challenges readers to imagine what our world could become, and what will be considered valuable. Every reader will be taken by Kira's plight and will long ponder her haunting world and the hope for the future.;"Matt 4ever.  Kira is a young orphan girl with a deformed leg, trying to make a living and survive in a Village where the ‘undesirables’ are often cast out into the Fields to be prey of the Beasts. Revealing a magical talent with embroidery, at her trial she’s spared on the condition of working for the village and improving the Singer’s robe; one of the pillars of the community that with their gifts help shape the society’s future. Befriending this figure and a few others in town, Kira slowly begins to unveil hidden secrets and that run under the innocent façade of a seemingly peaceful village.This book was an excellent surprise! A surprise because I was expecting a direct sequel to the events of #1 but instead got a completely different standalone story, and a surprise because I enjoyed it even more than the first. A somewhat short novel, yet still very powerful. In a way it could be said this was maybe too simplistic and innocent, not that that made it at all any less enjoyable. Little Matt and his doggie Branch were the best of the book by far, two secondary characters endearing and funny to no end, the kind that make you smile and laugh every time they appear. Kira, Thomas and Jamison also good. And the plot and progression engaging enough. A book I keep in my memory as the best or second best in the series. Recommendable.-----------------------------------------------

Specials;Scott Westerfeld;2006;2000;384;3.76;193734;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Teen'];"""Special Circumstances"": The words have sent chills down Tally's spine since her days as a repellent, rebellious ugly. Back then Specials were a sinister rumor -- frighteningly beautiful, dangerously strong, breathtakingly fast. Ordinary pretties might live their whole lives without meeting a Special. But Tally's never been ordinary.And now she's been turned into one of them: a superamped fighting machine, engineered to keep the uglies down and the pretties stupid.The strength, the speed, and the clarity and focus of her thinking feel better than anything Tally can remember. Most of the time. One tiny corner of her heart still remembers something more.Still, it's easy to tune that out -- until Tally's offered a chance to stamp out the rebels of the New Smoke permanently. It all comes down to one last choice: listen to that tiny, faint heartbeat, or carry out the mission she's programmed to complete. Either way, Tally's world will never be the same.";This disappointed me so much. I really loved  Uglies and there was a lot to admire about  Pretties, but I found this to be a highly unsatisfactory conclusion. I’m still trying to figure out why it so completely failed to work for me. I think mostly it’s a case of character development: Tally goes through a lot of mental and emotional changes in these books, which makes sense, because her brain is being fucked with. In the first two books, Westerfeld took the time to explore these transitions, and Tally’s growth was really interesting. However, by the time we get to book three and Tally’s brain has been reset AGAIN, it’s becoming frustrating and it doesn’t help that in this final book Westerfeld doesn’t take the time to explore what’s really going on with her. Add to that Shay’s many reversals—I kept expecting it to be revealed that she’s totally PSYCHOTIC, but apparently not—Zane’s quick dismissal, and the almost complete absence of David (after he was also barely in the last book) and you can’t help being disappointed with the conclusion to these characters’ stories, because they barely seem like the characters you started out with and that Westerfeld made you care about. Also, the dissolution of Dr. Cable’s system seemed waaaaay too easy, so I didn’t find this satisfying on a plot level, either. Sigh. Well, I guess I’ll just have to remind myself that 1) I really liked the first book and 2) the next two were nowhere near as bad as, say, the Matrix sequels.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24765.Specials

From dinosaurs, to diseases, to genetic engineering, to, in the case of Prey, nanotechnology. If you read a Crichton book and don't say to yourself, ""Damn!

One of my issues with it, though, was how bizarre and out there some of the plot twists were. These did not make it bad by any means, but super confusing and unbelievable (in a few cases it kind of led to some plot holes, too.)Despite any minor complaints I might have, I can easily recommend this book to someone who likes a good techno-thriller. Also, if you do like Crichton's other works, you really can't go wrong here.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83763.Prey

Something that changed them in ways they hardly understand.A quarter of a century later, the boys are men who have gone their separate ways. Though they still get together once a year, to go hunting in the north woods of Maine. But this time is different. This time a man comes stumbling into their camp, lost, disoriented and muttering about lights in the sky.Before long, these old friends will be plunged into the most remarkable events of their lives as they struggle with a terrible creature from another world. Their only chance of survival is locked in their shared past - and in the Dreamcatcher.;"Dreamcatcher, Stephen KingDreamcatcher (2001) is a novel, by American writer Stephen King, featuring elements of body horror, suspense and alien invasion. The book, written in cursive, helped the author recuperate from a 1999 car accident, and was completed in half a year. Set near the fictional town of Derry, Maine, Dreamcatcher is the story of four lifelong friends: Gary ""Jonesy"" Jones, Pete Moore, Joe ""Beaver"" Clarendon and Henry Devlin. As young teenagers, the four saved Douglas ""Duddits"" Cavell, an older boy with Down syndrome, from a group of sadistic bullies. From their new friendship with Duddits, Jonesy, Beaver, Henry and Pete began to share the boy's unusual powers, including telepathy, shared dreaming, and seeing ""the line"", a psychic trace left by the movement of human beings.Jonesy, Beaver, Henry and Pete reunite for their annual hunting trip at the Hole-in-the-Wall, an isolated lodge in the Jefferson Tract. There, they become caught between an alien invasion and an insane US Army Colonel, Abraham Kurtz. Jonesy and Beaver, who remain at the cabin while Henry and Pete go out for supplies, encounter Richard McCarthy, a disoriented and delirious stranger wandering near the lodge during a blizzard talking about lights in the sky. The victim of an alien abduction, McCarthy grows sicker and dies while sitting on the toilet. An extraterrestrial parasite eats its way out of his body and attacks the two men, killing Beaver. Jonesy inhales the spores of the strange reddish fungus that the stranger and his parasite have spread around the cabin, and an alien entity (""Mr. Gray"") takes over his mind.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوم ماه ژانویه سال 2010میلادیعنوان: شکارچی رویا؛ نویسنده: استیون کینگ؛ مترجم: پرویز کریمی ناصری؛ تهران، روشنگران، 1388؛ در 639ص؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21مروزی، روزگاری در شهر «دری»، که اشباح در آن، رفت و آمد می‌کردند، چهار پسر بچه، دست به عملی شجاعانه زدند، و شانه به شانه‌ ی یکدیگر، پسرک عقب مانده‌ ای را، از چنگال مشتی قلدر ضعیف‌ کش، نجات دادند؛ کاری که آنها کردند بی آنکه خود بدانند، آنان را دگرگون کرد...؛ داستان مبارزه ای هولناک با موجوداتی از جهان دیگر است.؛ ...؛ نقل از متن: (همین لرزش مرا استوار نگه میدارد؛ باید بدانم؛ آنچه ناپدید میشود، همیشگی است، و نزدیک، به روی خواب، چشم گشودم، به کندی، با رفتن به جاییکه باید بروم، میآموزم)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 20/08/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 26/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11570.Dreamcatcher
The Dark Forest;Liu Cixin;2008;2000;512;4.41;170245;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'China', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Aliens'];"This is the second novel in ""Remembrance of Earth’s Past"", the near-future trilogy written by China's multiple-award-winning science fiction author, Cixin Liu. In The Dark Forest, Earth is reeling from the revelation of a coming alien invasion — four centuries in the future. The aliens' human collaborators have been defeated but the presence of the sophons, the subatomic particles that allow Trisolaris instant access to all human information, means that Earth's defense plans are exposed to the enemy. Only the human mind remains a secret. This is the motivation for the Wallfacer Project, a daring plan that grants four men enormous resources to design secret strategies hidden through deceit and misdirection from Earth and Trisolaris alike. Three of the Wallfacers are influential statesmen and scientists but the fourth is a total unknown. Luo Ji, an unambitious Chinese astronomer and sociologist, is baffled by his new status. All he knows is that he's the one Wallfacer that Trisolaris wants dead.";"Ana’s Take:I can’t think of a book that has squandered more of my goodwill than The Dark Forest in recent memory. Actually no, scrap that. I can’t think of a book that has CRUSHED me more than The Dark Forest did. Beware, spoilers and CAPS LOCK OF FURY AHEAD.I loved The Three-Body Problem. I loved it so much, I handed it over to Thea, telling her: READ THIS NOW. We BOTH loved it so much, we gave it high ratings and the book eventually made our top 10 lists of 2014. I loved it so much, when it won a Hugo Award this year, I screamed. Needless to say, we were both super excited about reading The Dark Forest. Until it punched it me in the face. Multiple times.Just like its predecessor, parts of The Dark Forest are bloody fantastic. In the previous book, humanity found out that 1) we are not alone in the universe and 2) the aliens? They are coming. More than that, they are coming for us. The doomed Tri-solarians have set forth on their long journey to Earth and humans have 400 years to get ready. How to do that? How to prepare for the inevitable moment when we face those who come to destroy us?First, survival is the primary need of civilization. Second, civilization continuously grows and expands, but the total matter in the universe remains constant.Here is the (awesome) catch: the Tri-solarians have sent ahead particles called sophons that have the dual mission to spy on humans and to curtail technological and scientific advance – the very thing that could potentially save us all. What makes this absolutely thrilling is that although humans are aware that the sophons are here, we don’t know at which point this block will start to work so the only thing we can do is to carry on, trying to advance as much as possible without knowing where or when or how the block will be enforced.Also thrilling – and fascinating – is the great socio-political, philosophical insights into predicting how humans would react to all of this. There are many different answers to that: some wish to welcome our new overlords. Others wish for the destruction of the human race. Others want to invest in plans to escape Earth completely. Others want to stay and fight. All of those threads are examined and elaborated on and the result is thought-provoking.There is a tapestry of stories here but the one storyline that drives the plot forward more than any other is perhaps the one concerning the Wallfacer Project: four people are specially chosen and given ample power, unlimited funds and resources to come up with a plan to defend the planet. They must do that on their own – never letting anybody know of their plans so that the sophons cannot decipher it. Because of that, no one is allowed to question any of their orders, or deny any of their requests – as ludicrous as they might be. As a counterpoint, the Tri-solarians (or rather, their friends on Earth) come up with the Wallbreakers – four chosen individuals who will try to break their allocated Wallfacer.One of those Wallfacers is Luo Ji, a Chinese astronomer and sociologist and the closest thing that The Dark Forest has to a protagonist. Luo Ji has no idea why he was chosen as a Wallfacer, has no real plan, basically winging it throughout the novel – and yet for some mysterious reason, the Tri-solarians are determined to kill him at all costs.Like I said, the premise of the book is exhilarating – and it’s incredibly well developed too, in spite of the clumsy dialogue and occasional info-dump.Unfortunately, the book has one significant problem that I simply can’t overlook.Its treatment of women throughout is appalling. Enraging. It is so bad, it almost transcends “bad” into comical.There are no main female characters of any significance apart from perhaps, two or three: they are the Secretary General of the UN (described as a “refined Asian lady who didn’t project the sense of power needed”); a prominent scientist and Wallbreaker; and a general. In a cast of literal dozens, this is PITIFUL. Especially because their spotlight is short-lived.In fact, the world in this novel seems to be mostly populated by men, it’s a veritable sausage-fest. Most characters in the spotlight are men. All the Wallfacers are men. Throughout the novel, other women appear but they go unnamed, have no stories. It’s as ridiculous as having one particular storyline that follows a group of male friends and all of whom have names and stories. One of those guys has a lover and she appears in the background of their interactions all the time, has dinner with them, is there in a lot of scenes but is referred throughout as “the Sichuan woman”.Similarly, basically the first time we meet the book’s main character, he is in bed with a woman whose name he can’t remember:Luo Ji lay limp on the bed, watching the woman put on clothes after a shower through eyes still hazy from sleep. The sun, already high in the sky, shone through the curtains and turned her into a graceful projected silhouette, like a scene from a black-and-white movie he had forgotten the name of. But what he needed to remember now was her name. What was she called?Soon after that, they are walking outside, and she gets KILLED. He THEN remembers her name:He didn’t hear the heavy thud of the other impact, but then he saw the woman’s body soar over the top of the car and fall behind it on the road like a boneless rag doll. As it tumbled, the trail of blood it left behind on the ground seemed like it ought to mean something. As he stared at the bloody symbol, Luo Ji finally remembered her name.Do you think the narrative bothers to finally NAME her? No. Of course not. Why would it? Women are unimportant.Luo Ji is a man-child who says he has never been able to truly connect with a woman because when he was at university he made up a female character for an unwritten novel and fell in love with this imaginary person because she was the perfect woman. This is a part of the story that goes and on and on on how he created this imaginary woman. When he becomes a Wallfacer and is given unlimited resources to save the planet, he sets out to find this perfect woman, by asking his bodyguard to find her:“She… how should I put it? She came into this world like a lily growing out of a rubbish heap, so… so pure and delicate, and nothing around her can contaminate her. But it can all harm her. Yes, everything around her can hurt her! Your first reaction when you see her is to protect her. No, to care for her, to let her know that you are willing to pay any price to shield her from the harm of a crude and savage reality. She… she’s so… ah, I’ve got a clumsy tongue. I can’t say anything clearly.”He described how she had come alive for the first time in the library, how she appeared in his classroom during lecture, how the two of them had met in front of the imaginary fireplace in his dormitory, the beauty of the firelight shining onto her face through the bottle of wine like the eyes of twilight. He recalled with pleasure their road trip, describing every last detail: the fields after the snow, the town and village under the blue sky, the mountains like old villagers basking in the sun, and the evening and bonfire at the foot of the mountain…. After he finished, Shi Qiang stubbed out his cigar.“Well, that’s about enough. I’ll guess a few things about the girl, and you see if I’m right.”“Great!”“Education: She’s got at least a bachelor’s, but less than a doctorate.”Luo Ji nodded. “Yes, yes. She’s knowledgeable, but not to the point where it calcifies her. It only makes her more sensitive to life and to the world.”In a gross, completely unbelievable turn of events, they find this woman and Luo Ji marries her. And then the story proceeds to objectify and infantilise the character:Looking at her innocently holding the wineglass stirred the most delicate parts of his mind. She drank when invited. She trusted the world and had no wariness about it at all. Yes, everything in the world was lying in wait to hurt her, except here. She needed to be cared for here.When she saw its true appearance for the first time, what Luo Ji heard was not the squeals and fussing and exclamations that young women like her usually made. No, in the face of such a magnificent vista, she fell into an awed and breathless state and was unable to speak even one word of praise. He could tell that she was far more sensitive to natural beauty than other women.He was completely overcome by her childlike nature.Her English was strained, but her voice retained a childlike softness and she still had that cool spring of a smile, which stroked his weary soul like an angel’s hands.You might have been wondering… this is a book about alien invasion and high stakes, wtf is all this doing here. Well, dear reader: the zenith of this storyline is that Luo Ji is not doing his work properly and so THEY TAKE AWAY HIS WIFE AND FREEZE HER UNTIL SUCH A TIME WHEN HE DOES HIS WORK AND SHE CAN BE RETURNED TO HIM.Yes, you heard that right. This book LITERALLY fridges the woman to LITERALLY motivate the main character.Now, in fairness, there is an argument to be made that the story is taking Luo Ji’s misogynist views of women and using it against him. Especially when we find out that Zhuang Yan chose to sacrifice herself for humankind. I will counter-argue that we never get to hear from Zhuang Yan – her perspective and her choice are invisible to us, info-dumped from afar. This is particularly egregious in a book with multiple viewpoints and a lot of head-hoping.Ultimately, I deeply resent the fact THAT I HAD TO SPEND SO MUCH FUCKING TIME INSIDE THIS ASSHOLE’S HEAD. And more than being an actual, developed plot point, I’d say that there is no narrative pay-off for this misogyny. It’s there, normalised as a character trait and it goes nowhere. There is no point to it and it goes unchallenged. Was this a problem that existed in The Three-Body Problem and I glossed over it because one of the main characters in that book was a woman? It’s possible. I also wonder, perhaps uncharitably and unfairly, how much the change in translator from book 1 to book 2 has made an impact in the way the English narrative conveys all of this.At the end of the day, even though the main narrative thrust of the novel was incredible, I care far too much about about the book’s treatment of women to come close to liking The Dark Forest. In fact, I wish the Tri-solarians to come and obliterate this book from orbit.Thea’s Take:Ok. This is a tough one to write.It’s tough because I completely, wholeheartedly understand and agree with Ana. The treatment of female characters in this particular novel is appalling. It’s pointless misogyny, serving no actual purpose in the development of the overall story, it’s accepted and adopted by multiple characters (all men, of course, because there are no main female characters in this novel), and it actually is the literary equivalent of being punched in the face. Multiple times.For the entire first act of this book, we are subjected to the vile thoughts (and I say vile, because of the casual banality of this character’s attitude towards women) in Luo Ji’s head. These thoughts go unchallenged by the text; moreover, these sentiments are echoed by others in the novel (in particular, Da Shi, who plays a big part in Three Body Problem). What’s worse is, all of this narrative shittiness is utterly throwaway–in the first 200 pages of the book, nothing of real import or interest happens!It’s very, very hard to recommend a book–or continue reading a book–where nearly a third of the text is superfluous douchecanoery without forward momentum in terms of overall storyline.BUT.But.Once you get past the first part of the book and enter part 2, with the Wallfacer Project taking off in earnest, the Wallbreakers, and the looming reality of Trisolaran invasion and Earth’s preparations for the Doomsday Battle…once you get there, The Dark Forest delivers. BIG TIME. There are twists and shocking surprises and metaphors–and they are brilliant, if darkly shrouded in pessimism in the innate nature of intelligent life in the universe.And that’s where the conflicted part of my brain kicks in, because for as much as I hated the first 200 pages or so, I absolutely loved the brilliant, unexpected, and thoroughly awesome 300 pages that followed. The Dark Forest examines the 400 years that humanity has to prepare for the Trisolaran invasion of Earth, and face a huge disadvantage. To the advanced Trisolarian civilization, humanity are mere bugs–what’s worse, Trisolaris has sent sophons to Earth that are capable of preventing huge leaps in technological progress, listen/read/perceive of all human conversations and communication. What this means, effectively, is humanity can form no plans to fight the invasion without the sophons finding out and transmitting that information back to Trisolaris. In response to this formidable and seemingly unbeatable enemy edge, the human Planetary Defense Council creates the Wallfacer Project, in which four men–Frederick Tyler, Rey Diaz, Bill Hines, and Luo Ji–are selected to formulate plans that will save humanity. The kicker? These men can never reveal their strategies. They can never speak of or write their plans. They are granted unlimited power and privilege, given access to any resources they require to execute their defense and defeat of Trisolaris–and the sophons, for all their ability to eavesdrop and process information, cannot read minds. Nor can they understand the intricacies of human thought or deception.The plans that each of these men create–and the opposition they face from their respective “Wallbreakers”, human Trisolaran-sympathizers given the task of discerning the plans of the Wallfacers–are varied, completely unexpected, and utterly exhilarating to read. The one wildcard in the project is Luo Ji–who doesn’t want to be a Wallfacer, who squanders resources and time initially, but who is the key to humanity’s survival and victory. He’s also a pathetic human being and character–but that’s kind of besides (or maybe it is) the point.I don’t want to spoil how things unfold (ha) in The Dark Forest, or the revelations that the Wallfacers and Luo Ji in particular make. Suffice it to say, there’s a haunting elegance to the metaphor of the eponymous “Dark Forest” and that Cixin’s ultimate design by novel’s end are almost wholly breathtaking.Almost.For as much as I appreciate the metaphor of the title, the unexpected message of love and hope, and the unexpected and bizarre way things shake out in this novel, it is hard to recommend The Dark Forest. It’s hard to tell someone that they might be punched in the face for about 200 pages, but stick with it because the payoff is good. I completely understand and respect Ana’s opinion and position when it comes to this second novel.For me… I want to know what happens next. No, I need to know what happens next. I abhor the misogyny of the book’s first half–but I will be back to read Death’s End in 2016.Rating:Ana: 1 – NOPEThea: A 2 for the awful first 1/3, an 8 for the brilliant subsequent 2/3.

Messenger;Lois Lowry;2004;2000;169;3.91;139785;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Classics'];Messenger is the masterful third novel in the Giver Quartet, which began with the dystopian bestseller The Giver, now a major motion picture. Matty has lived in Village and flourished under the guidance of Seer, a blind man known for his special sight. Village once welcomed newcomers, but something sinister has seeped into Village and the people have voted to close it to outsiders. Matty has been invaluable as a messenger. Now he must risk everything to make one last journey through the treacherous forest with his only weapon, a power he unexpectedly discovers within himself.;"Regrettable.  Matty and the Seer live in the Village, once a happy and prosperous place, but lately a sinister influence seems to be affecting the community, tainting its neighbors, and the surrounding Forest. It all coincides with the arrival of the Trademaster, a mysterious figure who sales precious artifacts in exchange of the most unusual things…Another seemingly standalone story yet in many ways connected to The Giver universe. Sadly this installment was the weakest in the series, and I truly regret reading it. It’s not necessarily a bad story, it connects #1 and #2, provides some cameos and answers, and closes some timelines while leaving other ones open ended. However, for me it was for the most part boring, somber and tragic for no good reason. I can usually find some beauty in a good sad story, but I could find next to none in this one. Also bothers me that in the long run this novel doesn’t bring for me any important significance to the progression of the series,  other than heartbreak for Matty.  Ultimately I wish I had never read it, and it’s my sincere desire to warn others so to be spared the pain and disappointment. Given a second chance, I would skip it.-----------------------------------------------
PERSONAL NOTE
: [2004] [169p] [Dystopia] [YA] [1.5] [NOT Recommendable] -----------------------------------------------★★★★☆ 1. The Giver★★★★☆ 2. Gathering Blue ★★☆☆☆ 3. Messenger★★★★☆ 4. Son----------------------------------------------- Lamentable.  Matty y el Veedor viven en la Aldea, antes un feliz y próspero lugar, pero últimamente una siniestra influencia parece afectar la comunidad, contaminando sus vecinos, y el Bosque alrededor. Todo coincide con la llegada del Mercader, una misteriosa figura que vende preciosos artículos en cambio de las cosas más inusuales…Otra historia aparentemente solitaria que sin embargo está conectada en varias formas con el universo del Dador. Lamentablemente esta entrega fue la más floja de la serie, y verdaderamente me arrepiento de leerla. No es necesariamente una mala historia, conecta #1 y #2, provee cameos y algunas respuestas, y cierra algunas líneas temporales mientras deja otras abiertas. Sin embargo, para mí en su mayor parte resultó aburrida, sombría y trágica sin buena razón. Usualmente puedo hallar cierta belleza en una buena historia triste, pero pude encontrar poco y nada en esta. También me molesta que a la larga esta novela para mí no aporta nada importante ni significancia a la progresión de la serie,  excepto desconsuelo por Matty.  En última instancia desearía nunca haberla leído, y es mi sincero deseo advertir a otros para que puedan ahorrarse el dolor y la decepción. Dada una segunda chance, yo la saltearía.-----------------------------------------------

Life As We Knew It;Susan Beth Pfeffer;2006;2000;337;3.89;129870;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Survival', 'Apocalyptic'];Miranda’s disbelief turns to fear in a split second when a meteor knocks the moon closer to the earth. How should her family prepare for the future when worldwide tsunamis wipe out the coasts, earthquakes rock the continents, and volcanic ash blocks out the sun? As summer turns to Arctic winter, Miranda, her two brothers, and their mother retreat to the unexpected safe haven of their sunroom, where they subsist on stockpiled food and limited water in the warmth of a wood-burning stove.Told in journal entries, this is the heart-pounding story of Miranda’s struggle to hold on to the most important resource of all--hope--in an increasingly desperate and unfamiliar world.;"Okay, I was really looking forward to this book - I've been reading a lot of dystopias lately and they've surprised me in a positive way. Not this one.Why? SCIENCE. Listen, if you're writing fantasy or sci-fi that's not based on Earth you can go all out, like, ""That asteroid knocked Zhogenaqn, our moon, out of orbit, which caused all the feueldndao plants to release zignhnwp, a deadly virus."" It's cool. You can do that, and I won't even bat an eyelash at it.BUT when you say ""oh all the astronomers were really psyched about that asteroid that would hit the moon, but it ended up knocking the moon out of orbit like a goddamn marble and make its way towards Earth"", then we have a problem. First of all, it would take an object equal to the moon in density and size, hitting it at the same velocity as its trajectory, but on an opposite direction to knock it out of said orbit. ARE YOU TELLING ME ALL THE WORLD'S ASTRONOMERS COULD NOT CALCULATE THAT SHIT?! Not that there would be anything to calculate since the book tells us the asteroid was ""a lot smaller than the moon""! Then a bunch of unrealistic, unscientific stuff happens, which is just basically a whole case of: author did not do the research - even if I were able to ignore that moon stuff , (WHICH, AS A SCIENTIST, I CAN'T) I wouldn't be able to ignore this! How the fuck do tides cause tsunamis?! Are tides somehow causing submarine earthquakes?! And the Yellowstone volcano erupted because of the moon (WTF?!?!?!) and all it did was send out a little ash?! And suddenly malaria?! I JUST CAN'T WITH THIS SHIT. I'm not religious, my family isn't religious. I don't care about religion. That being said, the author's attack on religious characters is absurd. Why are they being portrayed as whack jobs who incite children to starve because God will provide for them while churches are keeping all the food for themselves? Give me a break, the great majority of the world's population is religious, they're not all crazy people! And churches (or the equivalent depending on denomination) have a history of helping people when disaster strikes. Bitch all you want, but even now with this fucking crisis, there are a lot of people who would be starving if it weren't for food provided by organizations connected to religious movements.Don't use YA books as your platform to spout this kind of shit. It makes you look like an asshole. Especially if you already proved to the world you are unable to grasp the basics of science. And the story? If you advertise your book as a dystopia, don't make us read a teenage girl's diary unless shit actually happens in it! I know I sound mad, and I am mad because there is so much awesome stuff you could do with science on your side!! The author even quoted Star Trek TOS, which was pretty okay on the science bits (even though it had a lot of leeway what with it being in OUTER SPACE WITH ALIENS). But this book?";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213753.Life_As_We_Knew_It
The Year of the Flood;Margaret Atwood;2009;2000;431;4.06;126936;yes;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Fantasy', 'Canada', 'Speculative Fiction'];The times and species have been changing at a rapid rate, and the social compact is wearing as thin as environmental stability. Adam One, the kindly leader of the God's Gardeners—a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life—has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived: Ren, a young trapeze dancer locked inside the high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible. Have others survived? Ren's bioartist friend Amanda? Zeb, her eco-fighter stepfather? Her onetime lover, Jimmy? Or the murderous Painballers, survivors of the mutual-elimination Painball prison? Not to mention the shadowy, corrupt policing force of the ruling powers... Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating: the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move. They can't stay locked away... By turns dark, tender, violent, thoughtful, and uneasily hilarious, The Year of the Flood is Atwood at her most brilliant and inventive.;I’m really tempted to take a cheap shot at Margaret Atwood and call her the George Lucas of literature since I was very disappointed in this follow-up to Oryx & Crake.She built an intriguing world in O&C where corporations ruled and profited through genetic engineering and gene splicing animals in a way that would give Dr. Moreau some ethical concerns. And she tied that to the devastating story of how it ended along with the tale of Jimmy (Snowman), his mad scientist friend Crake, and the woman they both loved, Oryx.The Year of the Flood centers around two women, Ren and Toby, through the course of their lives before, during and after the disaster that occurs in O&C. Tobey has been victimized by bad luck and a vicious man to end up having to hide with the God’s Gardener’s. Ren’s mother fell for one of the Gardeners and left her husband, taking Ren from the cushy corporate compound they had been living.God’s Gardeners are a green religious group led by Adam One. By taking animal rights to a peaceful extreme and tying it to Christianity, they’ve attracted a small following despite the consumerist culture around them. Adam One preaches about the Waterless Flood, a disaster that will pay back humankind for all the injustices done to the animal kingdom, and those who have read Oryx & Crake know that Reckonin’ Day is coming.Ren is eventually returned to the corporate compound life, but never forgets her time with GG or her best friend, Amanda. Tobey is surprised to find herself becoming one of the respected senior members of the GG as time passes. Neither woman knows it, but they keep brushing up against the events and people who will eventually cause the Flood. Especially Ren who’s first real boyfriend, Jimmy from O&C, breaks her heart and leaves her pining for him for the rest of the book. I was really looking forward to reading more about this culture that Atwood had described in Oryx and Crake, especially since the first book centered on the ‘elite’ types who work and live in the corporate compounds, and this was more about the rest of the people trying to live in a world turned into a biological and ecological madhouse. But after reading it, I really don’t see what the point was. Oryx and Crake did just fine as a standalone book. Giving me another version of events from an outsider’s perspective really didn’t add anything to it. More, since I knew how it was going to end, I wasn’t nearly as involved in this story as I was O&C. Plus, while O&C ended on an ambiguous note, Year of the Flood gives us resolution to that book, only to introduce a new ambiguous ending. Also, there are far too many coincidences to be remotely plausible about survivors who knew each other before the Flood constantly running into each other after the big disaster. It’s less of an apocalypse and more like a class reunion. I haven’t been this disappointed since Jar Jar Binks showed up. And I’m worried that Atwood will be releasing Special Digitally Enhanced Versions of Oryx & Crake and The Year of the Flood very soon. I probably shouldn’t be this hard on a book that had some great writing, but I really liked Oryx and Crake so reading this one left me feeling like I got a plate of reheated leftovers and it’s making me bitter. (I have no idea if Atwood plans to do any more books related to this story, so if she releases some kind of brilliant third book that ties all of this together and enhances the overall story, I reserve the right to change my mind about this one.)And on a humorous side note, I listened to the audio book version of this, and the song lyrics included by Atwood as part of Adam One’s sermons have been turned into some horrible post-modern Christian rock tunes. It made Creed sound good.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6080337-the-year-of-the-flood
School's Out—Forever;James Patterson;2006;2000;409;4.14;122199;yes;['Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Paranormal', 'Action'];"In this eagerly awaited follow-up, brave bird-kid Max and her flock are discovered by an FBI agent and forced to go to ""school."" There is no such thing as an ordinary day as Max deciphers how and when she's supposed to save the world, and she faces her greatest enemy--a clone of herself. Little, Brown and Company";"What I liked:-Max. She got some pretty good character development in this book, and I enjoyed her exploring her more “feminine” side, and I especially liked her date with Sam. I also liked her little jealous streak when Fang got kissed by Lissa, and I liked Fang’s equal amount of jealousy towards Sam.-Iggy. I liked the development with Iggy and his family. It seemed real and not the cheesy expected fairytale ending that I was expecting James Patterson to write. I liked that his parents saw him as a freak and as a way to make some money, and I found that to be very believable.What I disliked:-Plot. There didn’t seem to be much of one in this book. It seemed like it was mostly following the flock while on the run as they dodge random eraser attacks that are never explained. Then they find a new home and they spend the rest of the book trying to settle in and they go to school. There isn’t much to it. There is so much useless filler in this series it isn’t even funny; it’s just a waste of paper.-Writing style. James Patterson has the simplest writing style I’ve ever come across in all of the books I’ve read, and it really annoys me. There is very little description, and there is so much useless filler in not only this book, but the rest of the series, and the rest of JP’s books. It was a waste of paper and time. The book could have easily been half the size, and it would have been better. Plus, the characters are a bit immature. I know they’re young, but under their current circumstances—being chased relentlessly by evil people, living on the streets, eating out of garbage cans, fighting for their lives—I would think they’d have matured a bit over the years, but they haven’t.Overall, this book was just okay. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t good. It was just kind of average, and I could have gone without reading it, but if you enjoyed the first book, you’ll most likely enjoy this book as well. 2.0";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13139.School_s_Out_Forever
Extras;Scott Westerfeld;2006;2000;417;3.6;121225;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Teen'];A few years after rebel Tally Youngblood takes down the Specials regime, a cultural renaissance sweeps the world. “Tech-heads” flaunt their latest gadgets, “kickers” spread gossip and trends, and “surge monkeys” are hooked on extreme plastic surgery. Popularity rules, and everyone craves fame.Fifteen-year-old Aya Fuse is no exception. But Aya’s face rank is so low, she’s a total nobody. An extra. Her only chance at stardom is to kick a wild and unexpected story.Then she stumbles upon a big secret. Aya knows she is on the cusp of celebrity. But the information she is about to disclose will change both her fate…and that of the brave new world;"Like the other books in the Uglies trilogy, Extras is fun and a very fast read. I read this book in about 2 and 1/2 hours, pretty much non-stop. However, Extras raised the same prickly issues for me that the other books in the series did. My years as a student steeped in cultural studies and gender theory make it pretty much impossible for me to read works of popular fiction without subjecting them to critical analysis, and Westerfeld's books certainly lend themselves to this sort of critique. Especially if you are like me. Like most dystopian science fiction, Westerfeld's books cast a critical eye on disturbing aspects of our present-day society -- obsession with looks, fame, etc -- by taking those aspects to extremes and weaving them into the very fabric of the future society. In Uglies & Pretties, everyone is ""cured"" of ugliness through a mandatory operation that takes place when individuals turn 16. In Extras, people earn money, respect, and privilege through the ""reputation-based"" economy, which rewards those who can make a name for themselves by publicizing and popularizing their thoughts, exploits, etc through the ""feeds"" (read: Internet). (If you think this is an interesting idea, you might want to check out Cory Doctorow's book ""Down & Out in the Magic Kingdom"" which explores the same conceit but with more skill and humor). In all of these books, the main (female) character desperately wants to be pretty, special, popular, famous or whatever, but ends up questioning the values of her society when she meets outsiders who don't subscribe to those norms. The problem I have with Westerfeld's books is that these critiques, which are intriguing and thought-provoking, don't actually go far enough. Although the main character openly questions and in some cases initially resists the societal mandate to become pretty, special, famous, etc, she ALWAYS eventually ends up becoming pretty or famous even if it is against her will. Unlike all the other unenlightened pretty or famous folks who have never questioned their society's structure, however, she is well-aware of the pitfalls. She is now in fact doubly privileged -- as a pretty/special/famous person she has all the privileges that go along with being high-status in her society, AND she also has a sophisticated understanding of the ""dark side"" of her society that others can't see, through ignorance or fear or whatever other blinders they have on. So although Westerfeld is clearly trying to show the reader how screwed up the dystopian society's norms (and by implication our own) are, in the end, he simply reinforces them. In Westerfeld's world, you can be hip to the ways in which our society's obsession with looks and celebrity oppress others and rail against the system, but you can still benefit from them at the same time. There's no sacrifice to make. And I guess that's why, as much as I enjoy Westerfeld's books, I can't help thinking that ultimately they're as shallow as the cultural norms they purport to critique.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/493456.Extras

Much of the YA Lit that I read though, is, in fact, well written, intelligent, thought-provoking pieces of literature. The Maximum Ride series was certainly never that. While I enjoyed the first two Maximum Ride books (The Angel Experiment and School's Out Forever), they are certainly brain candy. I know it's full of sugar and empty calories, but its just so addicting to read something interesting without actually having to think about it. Unfortunately, Maximum Ride: Saving the World and other Extreme Sports lacks any substance what-so-ever. Its the equivilant to eating cubes of sugar. The other plots, while predictable, were at least plausible (in a bird-avian-hybrids-fighting-to-save-the-world-is-normal sort of way). The style of writing, while cute in the first two books, is now extremely annoying. What was, at first, an attempt to sound authentic, is now appearing a desperate attempt to sound young.

Perhaps I am way more influenced by title and cover than I like to admit - though there's nothing actually wrong with either, I still feel like this doesn't scream at me ""awesome dystopian setting + interesting questions about what it means to be human!!"". It's good. Really good. If you liked Unwind, then you should also like this.I loved the setting - Mexico - and it was obvious to me that the author was very familiar with Mexican culture and legends, she incorporates a lot of this into the story. I suppose one of the quickest ways to mess up your novel is to write about places and things you don't have a clue about, but I still really wish more authors would try to use different settings. There's a whole world out there that I'm not in a position to explore right now so I like to pretend I'm there by visiting other countries in books. Plus, is it that hard to do a little research on a country's culture, traditions and legends (etc.)?In The House of the Scorpion we are immediately introduced to a boy called Matt who is a clone that was grown in a cow and harvested. The man who shares his DNA is El Patron, the extremely rich head of a huge opium empire and a man with the power to deliver to himself a longer than usual life with the help of clones. Matt's relationship with El Patron is conflicted. On one hand, Matt knows he is evil and corrupt - he plants chips in people's heads to make them obey his orders without question - but Matt also knows that El Patron is himself. They are both intelligent and talented individuals, Matt acknowledges multiple times how alike the two people are. But Matt is treated by others as an animal, they do not see how anything grown in a cow can be human and some of the treatment he endured really pissed me off, never mind the fact that his genetic make-up is identical to El Patron's.Matt questions himself and the world around him throughout the book. He finds it hard to believe that El Patron could possibly mean him harm - because how could you harm yourself? It's also a look at what makes someone human and how easy it is for people to dehumanize and convince themselves that a person is nothing more than an animal. The House of the Scorpion, in my opinion, could only be improved by removing that chunk of story after Matt escapes. It felt at odds with the rest of the book and it was clearly the author's attempt to quickly drop in one more big issue - socialism - but it just felt forced and wasn't needed, it's not like we don't already have enough to go on with all the ethical questions flying around in this novel. Take that out and this book would be five stars. But anyway, it's still a really great story about cloning and about humanity that will probably make you want to punch several of the characters at times. But, as with Sisters in Sanity, I seem to like books that make me furious, guess they just make me care more.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13376.The_House_of_the_Scorpion
Leviathan;Scott Westerfeld;2009;2000;440;3.92;93042;yes;['Steampunk', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Alternate History'];Prince Aleksander, would-be heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, is on the run. His own people have turned on him. His title is worthless. All he has is a battletorn war machine and a loyal crew of men.Deryn Sharp is a commoner, disguised as a boy in the British Air Service. She's a brilliant airman. But her secret is in constant danger of being discovered.With World War I brewing, Alek and Deryn's paths cross in the most unexpected way…taking them on a fantastical, around-the-world adventure that will change both their lives forever.;"Like many of my friends, I've been looking forward to getting my hands on ""Leviathan"" for a while. It is so sad that after such a long wait I can't give this book more than 2 stars. And if I am being honest, I added second star for fabulous cover art and excellent illustrations (1 or 2 per chapter!). My low rating doesn't mean however that I would recommend NOT to read this book. I simply didn't care for it personally, for several reasons.First, this book seems to be mistakenly classified as young adult fiction. To me it read more like a children's book, middle school maximum. For a book about 15-16 year olds, Daryn and Alek are written awfully young. By the way their thought process, their behavior and motivations are portrayed, you'd think they are 11-12 years old, they are even drawn by the illustrator as pre-teens. I can enjoy some books written for this age group, such as first 2 Harry Potter books or ""His Dark Materials,"" but the world of ""Leviathan"" just didn't hold my attention.Secondly, the book is extremely heavy on descriptions of various machinery and fabricated animals and battles between them. I know, this is the core of the book - a war between Clankers and Darwinists - but I hoped this concept would be presented in a more interesting manner. Just reading about how the zeppelins are constructed or how to operate an airship made out of a combination of creatures bored me to death. And lastly, for a book that is supposed to offer an ""alternative history,"" the ""alternativeness"" is very thin and doesn't go beyond war machinery. The rest is pretty much taken from real history - we are not offered anything new in terms of government structure, social order, belief system, etc. It is possible however that Westerfeld will explore these avenues in later books in the series.I wouldn't discourage anyone from giving this book a shot. But if you are like me and prefer books for older teens, have no interest in mechanics and war battles, like to have a little bit of teen romance in your stories, you can safely skip this book.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6050678-leviathan
Hunger;Michael  Grant;2009;2000;608;4.02;87965;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Paranormal', 'Horror'];It's been three months since everyone under the age of fifteen became trapped in the bubble known as the FAYZ.Three months since all the adults disappeared.

The Darkness, a sinister creature that has lived buried deep in the hills, begins calling to some of the teens in the FAYZ. Calling to them, guiding them, manipulating them.The Darkness has awakened. And it is hungry.;"Whilst this book impressed me greatly, as did the first of the series, I found that there were still those little things that majorly irked me, even amid the fast-paced sci-fi and action told in a gripping and imaginative way; it was these little things that again prevented me from awarding the novel the 5 stars it would have otherwise deserved.So what's the problem?I can sum it up in two points:1) Sam is a lame protagonist.2) All the girls are 'cute'.Let me explain.Pointer number one: Sam is one of those over the top do-gooders that just don't exist in real life, let alone at fifteen. He is given too much credit for his age by the author and his character becomes increasingly unrealistic, Sam is essentially the very ideal stereotype of the 'good guy', the hero, the constant martyr for the greater good. Oh please, he's a fifteen year old guy in a town with no adults, he should be drinking like a fish and raiding the porn sections at the local stores. His self-pitying attitude also results in generating absolutely zero sympathy.Pointer number two: The girls of this novel are teeth-grindingly useless. Astrid the genius is Sam's 'beautiful' girlfriend and the dark and seductive Diana is Caine's obedient sidekick. Nearly all the females are trophies and repeatedly described as 'hot' or 'cute'. They also need protecting. There is way too much of this:And nowhere near enough of this:Whatever happened to the ass-kicking female? She isn't in this book. Other readers might point out characters like Brianna and Lana as examples of strong females. However, in the heat of battle when Brianna is required to be strong, she instead decides to run away and cook herself a pigeon. What the hell?? And Lana is not strong enough to defeat the lure of the 'Darkness' but rather leads the others into danger and needs to be rescued. By Sam, Caine and Duck (the male characters who come swooping in to rescue her), in fact. Also, most of the battle stuff is done man-to-man. Usually featuring Sam, Caine, Drake, Edilio, Orc and Jack; the girls tend to hide behind the rubble or are used to threaten their boyfriends (i.e. Caine threatening to kill Astrid unless Sam surrender). Seriously? Why are all the strongest mutants male, anyway? Is radiation that particular?After this great big rant, you're gonna be thinking - how the hell did it get 4 stars then?Well, it's a great story really. It's exciting and action-packed, there are always several sub-plots happening at once meaning that the book never gets slow or tiresome. Some of the characters are interesting and highly likeable and it's a good portrayal of growing up and the difficulties of being a teenager (only times by about a thousand). Every teenager should be reading this series, my only recommendation is that they follow it up with a large dose of Buffy The Vampire Slayer to remind themselves that having a vagina does not equal weak, pathetic damsel in distress. Quite the opposite at times.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61762227-hunger

The battle school is no more.But with the external threat gone, the Earth has become a battlefield once more. The children of the Battle School are more than heroes; they are potential weapons that can bring power to the countries that control them. One by one, all of Ender's Dragon Army are kidnapped. Only Bean escapes; and he turns for help to Ender's brother Peter.Peter Wiggin, Ender's older brother, has already been manipulating the politics of Earth from behind the scenes. With Bean's help, he will eventually rule the world.";"5.0 stars. Sometimes love is not a strong enough word so I am going to borrow from Woody Allen, ""I LURVE THIS BOOK!!! This is my second favorite book in both Ender series (behind only Speaker for the Dead). In fact, like Speaker for the Dead, I thought this book significantly surpassed its predecessor, Ender's Shadow which I loved by the way.  This story takes place in the latter half of the 22nd century (so my poster above is for the 2208 elections), soon after the end of the Formic (aka Bugger) War when all of the gifted children of the Battle School that fought under Ender have returned to Earth. Upon their return, these gifted warriors all become instant national treasures in the eyes of their respective countries who want to use their vast expertise in strategy and tactics to assist them in the global war that they know is coming. It seems once the threat to humanity has been eliminated, people are going back to thinking of their own petty dreams of power...typical. Ender, whose very presence on Earth was seen as too much of a destabilizing force, has agreed to be sent into exile to avoid a global fight over the use of his abilities. Personally, I think he should have shown up with his mates and kicked the idiots in power in their collective, narrow-minded asses, but that's just me. Anyway, soon after their return, the former members of Ender's Army or “jeesh” are kidnapped and an attempt is made upon Bean's life. I won't give away any spoilers, but from this point forward the plot unfolds as a massive, complicated version of the board game ""Risk"" with moves, countermoves, alliances, betrayals and some absolutely stunning battle maneuvers with the end prize for all of this being global domination. The scope of this book is amazing, but the best part about it is Card's writing and his attention to detail. Especially impressive is the dialogue between the various gifted characters (most notably Bean and Peter Wiggins) and how authentic it sounds. This certainly belongs among the elite installments of the Ender series and I give it my HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!

Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can't catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman's new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman's nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears.

Very soon, she came upon a house made of books. She knocked at the door but no one answered, so being a rather bold and sassy little girl, she walked right in.At the table in the kitchen, there were three science fiction novels. The first one was called The Wind-Up Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi. Goldilocks began to read. “Ugh!” she exclaimed, “This plot is too cold, not to say clinical, lumbering, tiresome, and altogether too exegetical!” And she flung the book across the room. So, she began to read the second novel which was called The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldrich by Philip K Dick. “Ouch! This plot is too hot! It’s as mad as a bag of frogs! I can’t make head nor tail!” And she flung the book across the room. So, Goldilocks read the last book, which was called  Tiger! Tiger!  by Alfred Bester. “Ahhh, this is just right!” said Goldilocks. “Fast and furious but cramful of tasty ideas too!” And she read until the very last page.Goldilocks was very tired by this time, so she went upstairs to the bedroom. She lay down in the first bed, but it was too hard. Then she lay in the second bed, but it was too soft. Then she lay down in the third bed and it was just right. Goldilocks fell asleep.As she was sleeping, the authors came home.""Someone's been reading my book and they only gave it two stars!” growled Paolo. “Didn’t they realise it won the Nebula AND the Hugo??”""Someone's been reading my book too, and they threw it across the room!” said Philip K Dick.""Someone's been reading my book and they gave it a five star rating on Goodreads!” said little Alfred Bester. They decided to look around to see if the mysterious person was still in their house and when they got upstairs to the bedroom, they found Goldilocks asleep, and went through the whole tedious routine again. Finally,""Someone's been sleeping in my bed and she's still there!"" exclaimed baby Alfred.Just then, Goldilocks woke up and saw the three authors. She eyed them coolly. “I understand you are smarting from my judgements. Your chosen genre is, I am the first to admit, not the easiest for the author or the reader. Each novel has to build another new world which inevitably will recapitulate the work of your forbears, thus risking genre cliché, or perhaps we should more kindlier say that you needs must explore variations on the well-known tropes (dystopias, aliens, time travel) and the tropes within tropes (sexy cloned girls for instance). So you are stuck with writing novels which are extremely heavy on exposition, and so compacted that each sentence becomes an exercise in exegesis. Characters become lecturers and the futurology becomes ever denser.” “What must we do?” asked Paoli.“Well, nil desperandum,” said Goldilocks. “I have read your short stories and they are excellent, but your novel – I could quite see how wonderfully imagined, sturdy and intricate was your future Thailand – you never failed to impress me, the size of your brain is something to see – but it was all so slow and turgid. You clearly missed the creative writing course where they tell you to put a sex scene in at page 30 (oh wait, we got that and very unpleasant it was too) and a violent scene in every 40 pages after that, you missed those.”“Why you cheeky young girl! Who appointed you as the supreme arbiter of science fiction novels?” roared Philip K Dick. “Well, no one, of course, I appointed myself, as does every reader – those are the rules of the playground.” And she jumped up and ran out of the room and down the stairs, out of the door of the house of books and ran away into the forest.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6597651-the-windup-girl

Why no action, no further development of the genetic enhancement ideas? Why are the premise and the motivation of the main characters so unreliable?

The Final Warning;James Patterson;2008;2000;256;3.85;72203;yes;['Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Paranormal', 'Romance'];In this breathtaking new story from the astonishing imagination of James Patterson, a girl has to save herself from an army assembled just to capture her -- and maybe save the planet while she's at it.Maximum Ride is a perfectly normal teenager who just happens to be able to fly, the result of an out-of-control government experiment. Max and the other members of the Flock -- six kids who share her remarkable ability -- have been asked to aid a group of environmental scientists studying the causes of global warming. The expedition seems like a perfect combination of adventure, activism -- and escaping government forces who watch the Flock like a hawk.But even in Antarctica, trapped in the harshest weather on our planet, Maximum Ride is an irresistible target in constant danger. For whoever controls her powers could also control the world. Maximum Ride is James Patterson's greatest character, a heroine who manages to be human and fearless at once.;"My problem with the story wasn't so much that James Patterson used it as a soapbox for global warming -- after all, it's his book, and he can do what he wants. The problem, as I see it, is there was NO WAY he started writing this series with a plan to make Max's ""saving the world mission"" one that had anything to do with this topic. If you go back and read the series from the beginning, starting with THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT, we all knew that Max and the gang had a special mission, a mission that would save the world. We knew it would be big, and no doubt unbelievable, as most of Mr. Patterson's plot lines are. But if this had been his plan all along, you have to think that there would have been SOME advance warning. No, what really ticks me off is that it seems as if he decided, with the current state of affairs, to change the whole point of the books at the very last minute, as a way to promote his cause. THAT'S what makes me angry. (The only good thing about THE FINAL WARNING? Total's ""I prefer canine-American"" comment, which made me laugh until I cried.)";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1829709.The_Final_Warning
One Second After;William R. Forstchen;2009;2000;352;3.97;68256;yes;['Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Apocalyptic', 'Audiobook', 'Thriller'];New York Times best-selling author William R. Forstchen now brings us a story which can be all too terrifyingly real ... a story in which one man struggles to save his family and his small North Carolina town after America loses a war, in one second, a war that will send America back to the Dark Ages ... A war based upon a weapon, an Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP). A weapon that may already be in the hands of our enemies.Months before publication, One Second After has already been cited on the floor of Congress as a book all Americans should read, a book already being discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a truly realistic look at a weapon and its awesome power to destroy the entire United States, literally within one second. It is a weapon that the Wall Street Journal warns could shatter America. In the tradition of On the Beach, Fail Safe, and Testament, this book, set in a typical American town, is a dire warning of what might be our future ... and our end.;"5 things I hated about ""One Second After"" - 1. Every important adult male character is either military or ex-military. Seriously. As a bonus, several minor characters that are merely alluded to are also ex-military. (For example, at one point we learn that a pharmacist's husband is an ex-ranger and insists that she keep a gun at the pharmacy. Good times.)2. As others have pointed out, the author doesn't know the difference between of and have.3. Much, perhaps most, of the action happens ""off screen,"" including the deaths of all but one of the major characters. Rather than active scenes, much plot advancement takes place via expository dialogue, which leads to:4. Most of the scenes are meetings or speeches, usually with the main character dominating the discussion with his references to military history. Rather than showing us the hoards of refugees storming the city gates or the plague wiping hundreds out within a month, it's discussed in the past tense at a meeting of city leaders amid lengthy asides about the main character either thinking about smoking or lighting one up. Most of the important events are handled this way.5. Almost every chapter has a character mention ""this is still America"" or ""we're still Americans."" Pretty annoying, but also an excellent illustration of how every character has essentially the same voice and world view.I had read that the author did years of research about EMPs, but even the technical side of the book seemed sloppy and careless - basically a few pages with a handful of EMP talking points repeated over and over.All together it was a frustrating read. The depth of the grimness is the only reason it doesn't get one star, but I could change my mind and lower it.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4922079-one-second-after
The Last Colony;John Scalzi;2007;2000;320;4.09;66428;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Military Fiction', 'Space'];Retired from his fighting days, John Perry is now village ombudsman for a human colony on distant Huckleberry. With his wife, former Special Forces warrior Jane Sagan, he farms several acres, adjudicates local disputes, and enjoys watching his adopted daughter grow up.That is, until his and Jane's past reaches out to bring them back into the game--as leaders of a new human colony, to be peopled by settlers from all the major human worlds, for a deep political purpose that will put Perry and Sagan back in the thick of interstellar politics, betrayal, and war.;"stupid fucking humans, you are the worst! always getting shit wrong and not caring!John Scalzi sort of agrees but sort of doesn't. he's a humanist who loves the individual as well as a scornful critic who slams systems, systematized secrecy, imperialism, and the use of conflict as a way to achieve goals. so he gets to have his cake and eat it too. his love of people is on display as ever, and although his characters often lack depth and aren't particularly interesting, they are still warmly characterized and pleasant to be around. sympathetic characters because Scalzi is a sympathetic sort of author. but he also finally gets to openly slam the Colonial Union and their war-mongering, secretive, tunnel-visioned ways. this is the third book in the series and the preceding books almost function as a wind-up to what turns out to be a mean right hook. stupid fucking Colonial Union, they've been long overdue for a knock-out.as usual the writing is pleasant and also generic. I did notice an increasing tendency to make things a bit too much on the nose. there's the name of the colony itself, ""Roanoke"", which of course has all sorts of resonance. but at least Scalzi acknowledges that. what's rather aggravating is the on-the-nose quality of the dialogue. it's always snappy and sarcastic and everyone responds with perfect timing; it's like a sitcom minus the laugh track. the end result is that it comes across as a bit plastic and characters sound a lot like each other.still, that's a minor complaint. overall this novel is fast-paced fun, full of adventure and politics and battles and aliens. because Scalzi is more interested in the human condition than anything else, his aliens often act just like humans. that can be annoying, but fortunately in this one he has a couple that don't: Hickory and Dickory. they were also pretty fun and I'm looking forward to getting to know them better in the follow-up novel.oh the synopsis, in my rush to get out of here I almost forgot: characters from prior novels lead a group of colonists to a new planet. the book is all about the layers upon layers of intrigue that surround this colony.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88071.The_Last_Colony
The Butlerian Jihad;Brian Herbert;2002;2000;695;3.97;66224;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Classics'];"Legends of Dune:The Butlerian Jihad It began in the Time of Tyrants, when ambitious men and women used high-powered computers to seize control of the heart of the Old Empire including Earth itself. The tyrants translated their brains into mobile mechanical bodies and created a new race, the immortal man-machine hybrids called cymeks. Then the cymeks' world-controlling planetary computers, each known as Omnius, seized control from their overlords and a thousand years of brutal rule by the thinking machines began. The human race still clings to life. Some, like idealistic Serena Butler of the free planet Salusa Secundus and her betrothed, the soldier Xavier Harkonnen, even dream of overthrowing the machines and freeing their human slaves. Others, like Vorian Atreides, bastard son of the cymek Agamemnon, are proud to serve the machines. But their world faces disaster. Impatient with human beings' endless disobedience and the cymeks' continual plotting to regain their power, Omnius has decided that it no longer needs them. Only victory can save the human race from extermination.Decades after Herbert’s original novels, the Dune saga was continued by Frank Herbert’s son, Brian Herbert, in collaboration with Kevin J. Anderson. Working from Frank Herbert’s own notes, the acclaimed authors reveal the chapter of the Dune saga most eagerly anticipated by readers: the Dune prequel...Legends of Dune: The Butlerian Jihad.Throughout the Dune novels, Frank Herbert frequently referred to the war in which humans wrested their freedom from “thinking machines.” In Dune: The Butlerian Jihad, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson bring to life the story of that war, a tale previously seen only in tantalizing hints and clues.Finally, we see how Serena Butler’s passionate grief ignites the struggle that will liberate humans from their machine masters; here is the amazing tale of the Zensunni Wanderers, who escape bondage to flee to the desert world where they will declare themselves the Free Men of Dune. And here is the backward, nearly forgotten planet of Arrakis, where traders have discovered the remarkable properties of the spice melange....";The seven dollars I spent for this book would have been better used buying a cup of battery acid to pour into my eyes.More detailed ranting here.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99219.The_Butlerian_Jihad

The world has been reduced to rubble. Humanity is nearly extinct. The half-destroyed cities have become uninhabitable through radiation. Beyond their boundaries, they say, lie endless burned-out deserts and the remains of splintered forests. Survivors still remember the past greatness of humankind. But the last remains of civilisation have already become a distant memory, the stuff of myth and legend. More than 20 years have passed since the last plane took off from the earth. Rusted railways lead into emptiness. The ether is void and the airwaves echo to a soulless howling where previously the frequencies were full of news from Tokyo, New York, Buenos Aires. Man has handed over stewardship of the earth to new life-forms. Mutated by radiation, they are better adapted to the new world. Man's time is over. A few score thousand survivors live on, not knowing whether they are the only ones left on earth. They live in the Moscow Metro - the biggest air-raid shelter ever built. It is humanity's last refuge. Stations have become mini-statelets, their people uniting around ideas, religions, water-filters - or the simple need to repulse an enemy incursion. It is a world without a tomorrow, with no room for dreams, plans, hopes. Feelings have given way to instinct - the most important of which is survival. Survival at any price. VDNKh is the northernmost inhabited station on its line. It was one of the Metro's best stations and still remains secure. But now a new and terrible threat has appeared. Artyom, a young man living in VDNKh, is given the task of penetrating to the heart of the Metro, to the legendary Polis, to alert everyone to the awful danger and to get help. He holds the future of his native station in his hands, the whole Metro - and maybe the whole of humanity.;"The Russians have a skill in writing apocalyptic, nightmarish stories. You only have to read the Strugatsky Brothers' ""Roadside Picnic"" (or watch the film version, ""Stalker""), Gansovsky's ""A Day of Wrath"" or watch Lopushansky's amazing ""Letters From A Dead Man"" to realise that they understand what it is to live on the edge of the abyss.Claustrophobic, dark cul-de-sacs of danger and terror, ""Metro 2033"" is a world of uncertainties and fear, hung on the fringes between survival and death. Criminals and refugees, traders and mystics... bullets used as currency... fear, and always uncertainty.Artyom, our hero, is asked to deliver an important message that could affect the survival of humankind in the subways. On his way to the centre he is aided, and hindered, by a motley crew of individuals who reflect the chaos that reigns below. The voyage is full of menace (though moments of almost calm menace and surreality are not uncommon).There is one brief sortie to the surface that becomes an adrenalyn-packed nightmare. I never realised that you can read a book through your fingers as you wait for the horrors to leap out from the ruins and the dark.This is, of course, an Odyssey and our brave Ulysses has to strive through his labours as he comes face-to-face with the demons that litter his nightmare world distorted and turned inside out by humanity. His is a noble task and he is aided by heroic figures, heroes that could have stepped out of the ancient myths... Yet questions and doubts are raised constantly... what sort of humanity is it that Artyom wants to save?... and what nightmares come flowing down the dark tunnels of the Metro.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17274667-metro-2033
Feed;M.T. Anderson;2002;2000;308;3.55;65092;no;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Teen', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy'];Identity crises, consumerism, and star-crossed teenage love in a futuristic society where people connect to the Internet via feeds implanted in their brains.For Titus and his friends, it started out like any ordinary trip to the moon—a chance to party during spring break and play with some stupid low-grav at the Ricochet Lounge. But that was before the crazy hacker caused all their feeds to malfunction, sending them to the hospital to lie around with nothing inside their heads for days. And it was before Titus met Violet, a beautiful, brainy teenage girl who has decided to fight the feed and its omnipresent ability to categorize human thoughts and desires. Following in the footsteps of George Orwell, Anthony Burgess, and Kurt Vonnegut Jr., M. T. Anderson has created a not-so-brave new world—and a smart, savage satire that has captivated readers with its view of an imagined future that veers unnervingly close to the here and now.;"In lieu of a review here is a rant inspired by Feed, using actual examples from real-life teens to illustrate the possible retardation of our culture and language. Enjoy.This is a discussion from the Emo Girls/Boys r HOT!! group on Goodreads. I wanted to see what our youth really talk like. I figured I'd get them at their best, discussing politics. Here's a sampling:I""M BLACK BITCH!! i'd b racest against ME!! no....Obama is just a fag...plain & simple!! ill bakk out right now... BYEZZZ sorry....gotz a BIT too into my whole rage thing there....hehe *SO embarasseddamn, well i really don't see why ya'll are getting so mad i mean he does have the privlege to say what he wants i mean we do have a feedom of spech you know? but i don't really care who is president, i mean i'm moving out of the country so i see no point in careingokay...so...? what is going on here? who has violent anger right now? lol i just saw a picture of Obama smoking some kill yo, hahaThese are some of the more outrageous things said, but most of the in between comments were things like: wat tha...!?, lol, and okai.Yeah, this is just a very small group of people, but similar comments, and spellings can be found in any of the 'teen' groups I've ever looked through for shits and giggles. These kids don't seem to write much differently then the people talk in Feed, a dystopian teen novel about the a society all jacked into the internet through their heads. Their world seems awesome, they party and buy shit all the time, and party more, and goto School™, where they don't have to learn stuff like reading and writing, but how to get a killer job, and find good bargains online. They hang out and don't talk to each other, but message each other in their heads privately. Oh they also have lesions on their bodies, their skin is falling off, and most of the planet is dying from the effects of the consumer lifestyle these kids enjoy, but that's a downer and anyway they don't have to worry about it because the feeds in their heads are customized to optimize the users preferences and enjoyment of life. To sound like a curmudgeon would be to say that this isn't to far fetched from how things are now, like we don't have lesions on our skin, and we also don't have flying cars (I forgot to mention that). We do have linguistic books though that stress that teens should be allowed to express themselves in their inane LOL speak because, well I don't know why, I only looked at the book jacket. We no longer have libraries in schools, but school media centers where kids are taught how to use the internet, because they probably aren't getting enough of it at home and they are instructed by School Media Specialists. I guess these really are librarians, but we've got to make it hip and happening to get kids into MEDIA and not just stodgy old books that have review processes and editorial control over content and that can't be interacted with and consumed like right now. Lets see we also have all those stupid fucking people on their handheld devices who are constantly texting messages, looking up things, reading their custom feeds and can't seem to go a couple of minutes without having to check up on what's going on in their cyber world. What else. Lets see during the last broadcasted UFC fight (ok, I'm not immune to stupidity either, watching fighting has become my most recent foray into mindless enterainment), they kept telling the viewer to log onto Twitter to follow the fights from the comments UFC President Dana White was Twittering ringside. I mean, isn't watching the fight and listening to Joe Rogan's commentary enough, but now we also need to have the experience mediated another step through micro-blogging? Ok, or maybe we can look at a group of kids sitting on the floor of a bookstore all on top of each other like cockroaches and they all have their sidekicks out texting away, maybe even to each other, but it's like hanging out to be online or something. How much easier would it be for all of this to happen if it could just be broadcast to our heads? I'm sure most people would sign up for it immediately. Then you wouldn't have to miss anything on any of the RSS feeds you're subscribed to, any of the news or gossip that keeps getting churned out to keep people checking back constantly, you'd never have to be bored because you could just call up a YouTube video and see it right there in your head. Who wouldn't want that kind of immediate access to the whole wide streaming world? I might sound a tad self-righteous here, but I'm as guilty as anyone. We are an increasingly retarded society being swayed by a profit driven media culture. Some of the conditions in the world created in Feed may still be a bit far off, we still have forests in our world; but the conditions for the ultimate consumerist culture are not too many steps away from what we are at now.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/169756.Feed

When anonymous acts of vandalism push them toward violence, it's up to Lina and Doon to discover who's behind the vandalism and why.An alternate cover can be found here.;If I could give this book 6 stars, I would. I enjoyed City of Ember as a fun, quick YA read, but this sequel is just as entertaining, while also being profoundly thought-provoking and insightful.I loved that the main characters - Lina and Doon - are honest and warm, with realistic struggles: Doon is still working on controlling his temper, and Lina's curiosity and impulsiveness still tend to cause trouble. However, they are both guided by good advice and a strong conscience, paving the way for growth.Incidentally, I was very surprised to see so many mediocre reviews on this book! I agree that the writing is fairly simplistic, but I actually felt that this contributed to the story, rather than being detrimental (I felt the same about City of Ember). Also, the message never seemed pushy or preachy to me. It's still definitely YA literature, but I highly recommend it for its great plot, wonderful characters, and quiet inspiration.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3467.The_People_of_Sparks
Shadow Puppets;Orson Scott Card;2002;2000;375;3.9;60134;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Space'];Bestselling author Orson Scott Card brings to life a new chapter in the saga of Ender's Earth.Earth and its society have been changed irrevocably in the aftermath of Ender Wiggin's victory over the Formics. The unity forced upon the warring nations by an alien enemy has shattered. Nations are rising again, seeking territory and influence, and most of all, seeking to control the skills and loyalty of the children from the Battle School.But one person has a better idea. Peter Wiggin, Ender's older, more ruthless, brother, sees that any hope for the future of Earth lies in restoring a sense of unity and purpose. And he has an irresistible call on the loyalty of Earth's young warriors. With Bean at his side, the two will reshape our future.Here is the continuing story of Bean and Petra, and the rest of Ender's Dragon Army, as they take their places in the new government of Earth.;Petra- I want to have your babies, Bean, even if you have a fatal genetic disease that might pass down to the kids and kill them painfully at a young age.Bean-I don't want you to have my babies because I have a fatal genetic disease that might pass down to the kids and kill them painfully at a young age and anyway, I'm not human.Anton-Even though I'm gay, I'm going to marry a woman and have babies with her because you can't be gay and be part of the Web of Life. You have to marry someone of the opposite sex, even if you don't love them and have babies, so have babies because that's the whole point of life is to just have babies, babies and more babies.Bean-Ok, I will have babies.Other stuff happens. There. Saved you money. Man, I hate this book.OK. I'm sorry, but Orson Scott Card is GROSS. Do you have any idea how young these characters are when they get married and decide to have babies even though none of their relationship is believable? SUPER MEGA UNDERAGED! UGH! You have a gay dude lecturing them about marrying people of the opposite sex and having babies, but how the hell is being two legal gay people together such a bad thing but two CHILDREN marrying such a good thing? Never mind that them having kids didn't even make any kind of logical sense in this book? In fact the whole plot is people doing something stupid and bad things happening as a result. I hate that kind of plot SO MUCH!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234724.Shadow_Puppets
Revelation Space;Alastair Reynolds;2000;2000;585;3.99;57023;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Hard Science Fiction'];Nine hundred thousand years ago, something wiped out the Amarantin.For the humans now settling the Amarantin homeworld, it's of little more than academic interest, even after the discovery of a long-hidden, almost perfect city and a colossal statue of a winged Amarantin.For brilliant, ruthless scientist Dan Sylveste, it's more than merely intellectual curiosity - and he will stop at nothing to get at the truth. Even if it costs him everything.But the Amarantin were wiped out for a reason, and that danger is closer and greater than even Syveste imagines...The original novel in the epic series, Revelation Space was nominated for both the BSFA and Arthur C. Clarke awards. Reynolds' PhD in astronomy and experience with the ESA means that his space operas present hard science spins on intergalactic adventures and have impacted SF for years.;"i suppose you could call Alastair Reynolds the Bad Twin of Peter Hamilton. both write space operas that come complete with mind-boggling concepts, galaxy-spanning adventures, bizarre aliens, space politics, love stories, and eons-old mysteries. but Hamilton writes about a future that despite having its ups, downs, and various inequities, is mainly Bright & Shiny, full of possibility. on the other hand, Reynolds' interests arise from the basic idea that the universe is a cold, scary place, full of dead things and barely-understood terrors. Hamilton's characters run the gamut of loveable to outright villainous; Reynolds prefers to write mainly about self-absorbed killers and assholes. one writes about factions of humanity trying to come together to fight off threats; the other depicts humans turning on each other and how things fall apart. so i guess it depends on your perspective: do you want your space opera glass to be half-full or half-empty?overall, i think this is a pretty good first novel. it is certainly an elephantine one; fortunately, the size didn't seem unecessary and i was aborbed by the ideas and narrative from beginning to end. Reynolds' background as a scientist is evident in spades, and i'm happy to report that my right-brained self didn't suffer at all when reading this - concepts were explained carefully and clearly, in a way that didn't make me feel particularly stupid and never felt didactic or condescending. characterization is certainly striking - if you are looking for characters that are charming or sympathetic or likeable, look away! you will not find that here. instead prepare to read about insanely arrogant scientists, vicious politicians, cold-blooded killers, and even more cold-blooded spaceship crews. it can get a bit oppresive at times.there is an interesting theme that slowly rises up through the narrative: the obsessive-compulsive nature of humanity. this is depicted within a military mind-set that views all outsiders as potential threats and a scientific mind-set that views exploring even the most awful and potentially threatening of things as the only option. characters in this novel don't just live with their obsessions, they are defined by them. characters don't make decisions based on anything resembling empathy or humanism - they are compelled to continually repeat and expand upon their compulsions, no matter what the cost. it is certainly a dark perspective on the nature of mankind.but that darkness, that oppressiveness, is really at the heart of this novel's appeal. the back cover quaintly describes this novel as ""CyberGoth"", which of course is a pretty stupid moniker... but it also makes some sense. imagine a gigantic spaceship crewed by five misanthropes, haunted by voices from outside of time, full of enslaved rats and unimaginably deadly weapons, captained by an unconscious individual whose plague symptoms include the transformation of all materials around him into a vaguely disgusting, tendril-y mess. imagine two planets: one whose decadent citizens while away the time playing assassination games and another whose berserk citizens seem to be engaging in relentlessly bloody revolution every couple years. imagine a culture where marriage includes a ""wedding gun"" that shoots dna of your spouse directly into your forehead. imagine a horrific version of the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, one where the unknowable enigma wants to kill you and all of your stupid little species. imagine Lovecraft in Space. there, now put that all together and you've imagined Revelation Space.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89187.Revelation_Space
Shadow of the Giant;Orson Scott Card;2005;2000;388;4.01;54553;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Space'];Bean, Ender Wiggins' former right-hand man, has shed his reputation as the smallest student at Battle School. He has completed his military service for the Hegemon, acting as strategist and general in the terrible wars that followed Ender's defeat of the alien empire that attacked Earth. Now he and his wife, Petra, yearn for a safe place to build a family - something he has never known. Yet no such place exists on Earth, a world riddled with Bean's enemies from the past. Once again he must follow in Ender's footsteps and look to the stars.;"4.0 stars. And so we arrive at the finale to the wonderful Shadow series on the heals of the tumultuous events of the previous three books, Ender's Shadow,Shadow of the Hegemon andShadow Puppets. For those that have not read the previous installments, there will be some spoilers below as the plot summary alludes to events that have occurred in the previous books. However, I will avoid spoilers for this book and will try and be as general as possible in the synopsis. This book concludes shortly after the conclusion of Shadow Puppets with the fall out from the momentous events of that story being felt around the world. Peter Wiggin, Hegemon of Earth, is trying to strengthen his fledgling “Free People of Earth (FPE)” and turn his figurehead title into a reality. Like the previous two novels, the central plot plays out like an enormous version of the boardgame “Risk” with Peter’s FBE competing and maneuvering against China, India, a revived Russia and a newly organized Moslem Empire. Each of these powers is being ruled or controlled by a former member of Ender’s Battles School “jeesh” and it makes for some fascinating move/countermove scenarios. In addition to the main story, a significant subplot is Bean trying to find a cure for his condition, known as Anton’s Key, which continues to make him smarter and larger to the point where his size will soon kill him. In addition, Bean is frantically searching for his missing “children,” the fertilized embryos previously stolen.While I did not like this as much as the previous books in the series, I still thought it was very good. The geo-political landscape of the future Earth of this series is such a fascinating place full of subtle intrigue and shifting alliances that it makes a great backdrop for the stories. I think Card did terrific job setting up this credible alternative future. Through all 8 novels in the Ender/Bean series, Card, in my opinion, has not written one below “very good” and this installment is no exception. The writing is excellent, the tactical/strategic plot elements are very well done and the dialogue between the ""gifted"" characters is terrific. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!One final comment I thought would share. I find it interesting that both the Ender series and the Shadow (or Bean) series have followed the EXACT same pattern as far as my level of enjoyment. I loved the first books (Ender’s Game and Ender’s Shadow). I loved the second books substantially MORE (Speaker for the Dead and Shadow of the Hegemon). I then loved the third books of both series more than the first but not as much as the second (Xenocide and Shadow Puppets). Finally, I really liked but didn’t love the fourth (Children of the Mind and this book). If nothing else, OSC is consistent.Nominee: Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8647.Shadow_of_the_Giant
The Adoration of Jenna Fox;Mary E. Pearson;2008;2000;266;3.69;52125;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Teen', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery'];Who is Jenna Fox? Seventeen-year-old Jenna has been told that is her name. She has just awoken from a coma, they tell her, and she is still recovering from a terrible accident in which she was involved a year ago. But what happened before that? Jenna doesn't remember her life. Or does she? And are the memories really hers?This fascinating novel represents a stunning new direction for acclaimed author Mary Pearson. Set in a near future America, it takes readers on an unforgettable journey through questions of bio-medical ethics and the nature of humanity. Mary Pearson's vividly drawn characters and masterful writing soar to a new level of sophistication.;"I confess, my reason for reading this novel was not very noble. When I added The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer to my TBR, a couple of astute friends informed me that this book's synopsis sounded strikingly similar to that of The Adoration of Jenna Fox. Naturally, I couldn't stay away from a possible rip-off controversy (I already have The Hunger Games/Battle Royale, The Giver/Matched, Twilight/Hush, Hush/Evermore ""research"" covered.) The jury is still out on The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer, but I found that A Long, Long Sleep had a fairly strong resemblance to The Adoration of Jenna Fox.Both set in a vaguely defined future, both involve teen girls who upon waking up after a long period of unconsciousness have to piece their pasts together, both have dangerously overbearing parents as major story players. But I liked The Adoration of Jenna Fox more. It is a very self-reflective story that examines medical ethics, free will and what it means to be human. Jenna's ""secret"" is easy enough to uncover, but the sophisticated moral questions raised in this book kept me glued to it until the very end.  Introspective and thought-provoking.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1902241.The_Adoration_of_Jenna_Fox
Little Brother;Cory Doctorow;2008;2000;382;3.93;51889;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Cyberpunk', 'Teen', 'Audiobook'];"Marcus aka “w1n5t0n,” is only seventeen years old, but he figures he already knows how the system works–and how to work the system. Smart, fast, and wise to the ways of the networked world, he has no trouble outwitting his high school’s intrusive but clumsy surveillance systems.But his whole world changes when he and his friends find themselves caught in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack on San Francisco. In the wrong place at the wrong time, Marcus and his crew are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and whisked away to a secret prison where they’re mercilessly interrogated for days.When the DHS finally releases them, his injured best friend Darryl does not come out. The city has become a police state where every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist. He knows that no one will believe his story, which leaves him only one option: ""M1k3y"" will take down the DHS himself.";"There is a reason why totalitarian governments ban books. The reason is that books can change the world. ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" and Frederick Douglass' autobiography opened people's eyes to the evils of slavery; Anne Frank's Diary taught us that genocide kills innocent young girls; ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" showed us that justice isn't always just and that people should be judged by their character rather than the color of their skin; ""The Grapes of Wrath"" opened our eyes to the plight of migrant farm workers; ""1984"" warned us about the perils of a nanny state. Now, in 2008, a new book of power has emerged. ""Little Brother"" is ""1984"" for the 21st century, but with more impact.I don't recall that the book ever states what the year is. It really doesn't matter. It takes place post 9/11. Terrorists blow up San Francisco's Bay Bridge and everyone's constitutional rights get trampled in the aftermath. This book is aimed at teens, but every American adult should read it too. Parents should read it with their teens and discuss it with them. (There are a few scenes of teenage drinking and sex, but the overwhelming message of this book is so strong that even this conservative mother is willing to overlook it.) My daughter was 18 on 9/11. My son is only 4 years away from being the same age as the protagonist. I remember how idealistic I was a teen. I read this book with all that in my experience. I read it as a mother; I read it as an idealistic teen; and I read it as a true believer in our rights as American citizens. I read thI didn't is book with tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat. At 47, I thought I was past the age when a book would have the power to move me and change me as profoundly as ""Little Brother."" I've read thousands of books in my lifetime. I have very fond memories of so many of them. But, when it comes to real power, ""Little Brother"" is right up there next to ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" I'd give it 6 stars if I could. It is that good.____________________________________________I do have to add that I gave this to my son to read before I read it. He is almost 13. He loved this book. He wants to read more books like it. I'm going to have to tell him that it's just a unique book. And, he did ask me why I didn't tell him it had ""adult situations."" I had to tell him that I didn't know. I really recommend that you let your teens read it before you do. They'll be less embarrassed that way. You can use the ""adult situations"" as a tool to talk about those touchy subjects of sex, drugs and alcohol.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/954674.Little_Brother
Ender in Exile;Orson Scott Card;2008;2000;369;3.92;51150;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Space'];"After twenty-three years, Orson Scott Card returns to his acclaimed best-selling series with the first true, direct sequel to the classic Ender's Game.In Ender’s Game, the world’s most gifted children were taken from their families and sent to an elite training school. At Battle School, they learned combat, strategy, and secret intelligence to fight a dangerous war on behalf of those left on Earth. But they also learned some important and less definable lessons about life.After the life-changing events of those years, these children—now teenagers—must leave the school and readapt to life in the outside world.Having not seen their families or interacted with other people for years—where do they go now? What can they do? Ender fought for humanity, but he is now reviled as a ruthless assassin. No longer allowed to live on Earth, he enters into exile. With his sister Valentine, he chooses to leave the only home he’s ever known to begin a relativistic—and revelatory—journey beyond the stars.  What happened during the years between Ender’s Game and Speaker for the Dead? What did Ender go through from the ages of 12 through 35? The story of those years has never been told. Taking place 3000 years before Ender finally receives his chance at redemption in Speaker for the Dead, this is the long-lost story of Ender.For twenty-three years, millions of readers have wondered and now they will receive the answers. Ender in Exile is Orson Scott Card’s moving return to all the action and the adventure, the profound exploration of war and society, and the characters one never forgot.
On one of these ships, there is a baby that just may share the same special gifts as Ender’s old friend Bean…";My Amazon review (yeah, I was pretty pissed):Subj: Deeply alienated by Card's recent work.A disappointing, socially unimaginative flattening of a character and a world I once loved very much. This novel was rife with ideologically and spiritually conservative addresses to the reader that seemed to diverge from the far ranging and broad discourses of the other books, at least the way I read them so many years ago. I felt alienated by the Wiggins of this novel, theirs and the narrator's presumptions about people's personalities and biological determinism, the absence in this world of any challenges to what seem like universally unquestioned ideas about family, gender, sexuality, social order, ethnicity and race--it's like ages of progressive thought on Earth were erased in order to create a universe where stereotypes turn out to be God's funny way of using DNA.What the narrator of this novel would have you interpret as the human individual's inability to escape her or his own genetic make-up is truly, to my eyes, an author's inability to let his characters be anything but allegories for an outmoded, oppressive conservatism at a time when authors should be offering something much, much better than an intergalactic expansion of the middle-class Anglo-Christian exceptionalism that has done so much to hurt the world.There's my elitist, queer-nerd, politically irked two cents. A dedicated reader of the Alvin, Homecoming and Ender series, as well as many stand-alone works, it pains me a little to say this will be my last Card novel for sure.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3220405-ender-in-exile
Pattern Recognition;William Gibson;2003;2000;367;3.87;51103;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels'];Cayce Pollard is an expensive, spookily intuitive market-research consultant. In London on a job, she is offered a secret assignment: to investigate some intriguing snippets of video that have been appearing on the Internet. An entire subculture of people is obsessed with these bits of footage, and anybody who can create that kind of brand loyalty would be a gold mine for Cayce's client. But when her borrowed apartment is burgled and her computer hacked, she realizes there's more to this project than she had expected.Still, Cayce is her father's daughter, and the danger makes her stubborn. Win Pollard, ex-security expert, probably ex-CIA, took a taxi in the direction of the World Trade Center on September 11 one year ago, and is presumed dead. Win taught Cayce a bit about the way agents work. She is still numb at his loss, and, as much for him as for any other reason, she refuses to give up this newly weird job, which will take her to Tokyo and on to Russia. With help and betrayal from equally unlikely quarters, Cayce will follow the trail of the mysterious film to its source, and in the process will learn something about her father's life and death.;2018 re-read.I wrote the below review in March 2015, obviously still not really sure what I had just read. When reading for pleasure (and a lot of the time truth be told) I am a simple man who’ll go after a laugh if there’s one to be had and I did then. But I knew I liked the book and I also knew there was more to the book than I realized.As readers, we must acknowledge our mortality and in so doing I am conscious of this fact when I consider re-reading a book. There’s only so much time and there are hundreds of thousands of books that I WON’T read, only a few thousand I will read (Lord willing and creek don’t rise). So making the extravagant decision to read a book a SECOND time is reserved for those that are special in some way.I have read hundreds of books and remember most of them, some more than others obviously. But there are some that I think about long after reading and Pattern Recognition was one. As time passed, I knew that I would need to go back to re-visit. Yes, NEED. When a writer plants a seed in your mind and years later you are still coming to grips with the fruit it bore, there is an intellectual, instinctive need to explore further. Gibson had struck a chord in me and what that was continued to nag away, demanding a more scrutinizing study.As the writer of Neuromancer, Gibson astounded with his prophetic heralding of the internet and all of the cultural implications that brought about. Here was a writer with his fingers on the pulse of our age, who could glimpse what came next in a way few others could. In the Blue Ant series, began with Pattern Recognition first published in February 2003, Gibson explored the months following 9/11 and again acting as a barometer for our atmosphere, cast a reflective surface before our collective countenance.When I deployed to Iraq in 2005, we had a briefing by an Army Colonel who described our mission and he said something that still sticks with me. He said the war on terror was largely a war of information. The terrorists were doing horrible things and then disseminating the information about those acts to cause further damage. The destruction in New York and Washington, and all the other acts against civilization, were the focal point, and like ripples in a pond, the concentric circles spread the harm out further and further.Gibson has here described a post 9/11 world where the protagonist has a hyper-sensitivity to advertising. She is psychologically allergic to logo branding and is a canary in the coalmine for global trends. Add to this losing her intelligence community father to the New York attacks and we have a metaphor for our new age. Gibson goes one step further (perhaps what he had been planning to write prior to the attacks) and emphasizes the vacuum created by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the post-Cold War age. The global power brokers and players sometimes just changed uniforms and kept playing the games.I missed a lot in my first reading but the demand for a re-visit was so rewarding. Gibson has given us a WEALTH of literary gold. This is a great book.***2015 reviewStylish.That’s what I am as I read Pattern Recognition by William Gibson. It is a very stylish novel. Cool jazz plays in the cool and stylish café as I sit outside drinking a latte. From my perfectly coiffed hair to the form fitting jacket and slim pants to the stylish Italian shoes on my stylish feet, I am cool. A Daniel Craig pout forms on my lips as I nod to the Most Interesting Man in the World sitting across from me. He is sipping a Dos Equis and chatting with two models sitting on either side of him. All of us, we are all stylish and cool.I turn page after stylish page but slowly my IMDB handsome brow creases, I frown.“What – “The Most Interesting Man in the World’s gut sags.“ in the–“The models sprout tattoos and one belches.“ hell – “My pants legs flare out and my perfectly coiffed doo melts to middle aged scalp.“ am I reading??”What are we doing? Where is this going? What in the hell is this book about?William, I am a Southern United States middle-aged guy. If I stand up straight, I might not drag my knuckles across the floor when I walk. I need swords, laser blasters, and automatic gunfire or my attention wanes. Hell, man, you’re from South Carolina and lived in Virginia, you’ve seen me in the line at Piggly Wiggly – you had a bag of almonds and mineral water and I had a 12 pack of PBR and potato chips.You gotta make it easy for me!!But actually, I did like it, liked it a lot.Gibson’s writing is fresh and vibrant and as cool as the other side of the pillow. Fans of his archetypal Neuromancer will pick up what he’s throwing down in this post-Cold War, post-911, corporate espionage, jet setting thriller set in London, New York, Tokyo and Russia. To readers who are swimming in the same atavistic gene pool as I am – just give it some time, he’ll get there and when he does, this will be revealed as tightly woven, extraordinarily entertaining post-cyberpunk literature of the highest order.BTW, the way to read William Gibson (or Neal Stephenson or China Mieville) is with an E-book reader so that you can easily select a word for dictionary and thesaurus explanation.

Pandora's Star;Peter F. Hamilton;2004;2000;768;4.23;50762;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space'];"The year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds, interconnected by a web of transport ""tunnels"" known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: Over one thousand light-years away, a star... vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the Second Chance, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him.Opposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship's mission for its own ends.Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted. Aboard the Second Chance, Kime wonders if his crew has been infiltrated. Soon enough, he will have other worries. A thousand light-years away, something truly incredible is waiting: a deadly discovery whose unleashing will threaten to destroy the Commonwealth... and humanity itself. Could it be that Johansson was right?";Better don´t try to find out how to deactivate that space megastructure.The überbeing Morning Light Mountain and the idea of a collective intelligence hive mind exponentially growing kind of insect like other kind of intelligence than humans thing, that is similar to a virus gone meta, is one of the most fascinating alien intelligence descriptions ever. Ever ever until it comes and exterminates your race. It´s not directly evil, it just hasn´t the intellectual need or interest to grasp that concept, it´s just his mentality logically developed because of an evolutionary arms race that made it necessary and possible to be a genocidal sociopath, what again lets it seem very similar to humans. But it´s not its fault, in contrast to humans. The Starflyer cult. What might happen if humans get any kind of contact with aliens? Jay, new sects growing like mushrooms, potentially in quantities that endanger the stability of whole colonies or even continents on earth, or why not the whole humankind? The descriptions of the megastructures built by a  Clarketech using Kardashev scale 2 or 3 civilization , the history behind that, and each Morning light mountain sequence are scenes that should be enjoyed like a good wine by sci-fi addict. Others, that aren´t fanatically hooked on the sci-fi genre, should better skim and scan, because they could see them as too wordy, static descriptions without any real action. In contrast to Hamiltons´ The Night´s Dawn trilogy, which plays in the 27th century and against a science fantasy horror not so always evil forever antagonist, the 24th century set Commonwealth Saga has a more down to galaxy enemy that still has the potential to rule them all. It´s immense how much effort Hamilton puts into his works, how he generates the fractions, settings, loads of characters, and what one can see in the timelines added to his novels is just the tip of the iceberg. Because he is a planner and plotter, he tends to create a new series over months before he starts writing, enabling him to hold different plotlines with many surprises, cliffhangers, revelations, etc. while never confusing the reader with moments of not knowing what is why where going on thanks to the character is plot, pure show don´t tell, style. This often seen problems in epic fantasy and huge sci-fi series, losing overview, being bored by infodumps, not knowing what the character´s motivations were, and thereby losing interest, are never occurring problems, because his writing is so always compelling. He just imagines all the potential for future realities and shows ideas, action, mentalities, and thereby new use of tropes, I have seen in no other works before. Great characters en masse and with enough personal space so that they can move, play, and grow, as one is used to from Hamilton´s epic series, are the most important ingredient to make it another astonishing masterpiece of one of the greatest sci-fi authors of all time. With his different works and series, he is covering different time periods of the future, always with an optimistic outlook, creating epic and extremely detailed descriptions of fights, worlds, aliens, future tech, and civilizations, and has a fusion and perfect balance of character and plot driven elements I´ve hardly seen in other authors work.If you are now into space opera or sci-fi in general, try the very complicated Reynolds and Stephenson, the philosophical Lem, the technothriller Suarez, the lengthy Banks and Brin, The Expanse of course, etc., and generally choose wisely with the help of listopia and dissecting your reading preferences, because there are many subgenres in sci-fi and if you pick the wrong one or don´t skim and scan the passages you personally don´t like so much, you won´t find the usual epiphany and pure reading pleasure the best genre of them all can offer to the reader.This wise, just joking, advice is added to all reviews of Hamiltons´series.One of the most fascinating aspects of Hamilton´s future vision is to see the technology and society developing in very detail over long periods of time, making a return to his universe something always stunning and inspiring. It also makes me wonder why he is the only author I know of who did this. One, who is new, lucky you, by the way, ought consider reading it in chronological order, although the series set closest to now, Salvation lost, is still unfinished, so better read before in the following order:Salvation year 2200Commonwealth year 2400The Night´s Dawn trilogy year 2700The Chronicle of the Fallers year 3400Void trilogy year 3600You can of course do as you wish, it´s just how I arrange my rereading to get the most out of it and slowly move further and further away from the boring present.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45252.Pandora_s_Star
Daemon;Daniel Suarez;2006;2000;632;4.16;46434;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Cyberpunk', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Technology'];A high-tech thriller for the wireless age that explores the unthinkable consequences of a computer program running without human control—a daemon—designed to dismantle society and bring about a new world orderTechnology controls almost everything in our modern-day world, from remote entry on our cars to access to our homes, from the flight controls of our airplanes to the movements of the entire world economy. Thousands of autonomous computer programs, or daemons, make our networked world possible, running constantly in the background of our lives, trafficking e-mail, transferring money, and monitoring power grids. For the most part, daemons are benign, but the same can't always be said for the people who design them. Matthew Sobol was a legendary computer game designer—the architect behind half-a-dozen popular online games. His premature death depressed both gamers and his company's stock price. But Sobol's fans aren't the only ones to note his passing. When his obituary is posted online, a previously dormant daemon activates, initiating a chain of events intended to unravel the fabric of our hyper-efficient, interconnected world. With Sobol's secrets buried along with him, and as new layers of his daemon are unleashed at every turn, it's up to an unlikely alliance to decipher his intricate plans and wrest the world from the grasp of a nameless, faceless enemy—or learn to live in a society in which we are no longer in control. . . . Computer technology expert Daniel Suarez blends haunting high-tech realism with gripping suspense in an authentic, complex thriller in the tradition of Michael Crichton, Neal Stephenson, and William Gibson.;Virtual reality gone bad by avatar NPC characters taking their job far too seriously described by one of Jules Vernes´ most stunning inheritors and the maybe best technothriller author of all times. Wait until it gets real, if it not even already secretly isSome Sci-Fi has the potential to become the continuation of the 20th century (and rarely 19th century) authors predicting the future and as always, it´s more a question of if and not when, I should stop saying that so often to avoid redundancy, but meh. In contrast to Sci-Fi genres dealing with possible, but not certain or probable scenarios, this new genre of science techno thriller conspiracy cyberpunk hybrids on the shoulders of Crichton and many others, (although far better written than this possible not best example, let´s take Stephenson instead, ah much butter), is dealing with topics humankind should possibly have an eye on. You know, wise and responsible preparation and sustainable longtime future planning, especially in politics. Stop laughing! I deem it the better Ready Player TwoDid anyone notice the parallels between this one published in 2009 and Clines 2011 published Ready Player One? I am sure that the ideas and concepts have been used several times in varying detail in Sci-Fi, especially dystopian and cyberpunk, I´ve read and forgotten or maybe even not read, especially in Cyberpunk and with the one or other machine intelligence robot alien race in massive hard science fiction space opera, etc series. Both of these masterpieces blow minds, open completely new perspectives, are unique, and open the world of game literature hybrids, jay! Games own all other mediaThe future is in computer games, the perfect culmination of everything that makes art great, music, scripts, and storytelling from movies and literature, art, design, animation, etc. combined with literature franchises, just as it´s happening with Minecraft and many series I don´t know or that will come. I imagine it especially amazing for the kids and teens that both play and read, that spent hundreds and thousands of hours in their favorite series, both single player and together with friends, not to forget AR, VR, and mind computer interface implants, nanobots, and the best combination of smart and real drugs to improve performance and widen perception. It´s as if a literature universe, like King, Pratchett, Sanderson,… would have become real life for older readers, as if one could choose and switch between the possible variations of how one wants to consume, one day reading, one day playing, or switches all 1 to 3 hours. Forget reality, it´s boring.Just too seductiveThe only problem, and that´s the reason why I stopped gaming over a decade or something ago when it still looked like lol rofl facepalm ICQ, is that it´s too great and immersive, especially for entertainment addiction prone people like me. But even for the ones who can handle it, I will give the old man´s advice of gaming wisely and responsibly, because this thing can easily, just like TV and even worse, eat away months and years of one´s life. It´s healthier than passive TV consumption and improves cognitive function if consumed in the right amount of some time every day, but the, again subjective, main problem is the immense seductive allure all embracing power over people´s minds. Many won´t be finding their kicks with literature or movies anymore, not to speak of real life, and that´s one of the most important messages of these novels to think about too. Jay, cultural pessimism.Meta leveling military industrial complex conspiraciesOn the meta level, there is also this thing of prodigies warning about AI, military experts talking about cyber wars escalating, and extremists using it to kill millions by destroying infrastructure, and the question of if it could be WW3 humans vs humans or humans vs machines. Not to forget the aliens, which could lead to four fractions of robot aliens, flesh aliens, humans, and humans´ robots and AI, complicating the genociding even more.I´ll avoid the infodump technobabble overkill but I could talk for hours and days about AI, technology, algorithms, social networks, the internet, MMORPGs, its impact on society, and especially comparing how Sci-Fi of different decades dealt with this topic, but I am a master procrastinator, aspiring grandmaster, and want to avoid investing too much real work *shivers* in creating redundant drivel about books. Read much Sci-Fi, cough best literary genre cough, instead to generate your own assumptions and analysis.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6665847-daemon
Quicksilver;Neal Stephenson;2003;2000;927;3.93;45504;yes;['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"Quicksilver is the story of Daniel Waterhouse, fearless thinker and conflicted Puritan, pursuing knowledge in the company of the greatest minds of Baroque-era Europe, in a chaotic world where reason wars with the bloody ambitions of the mighty, and where catastrophe, natural or otherwise, can alter the political landscape overnight.It is a chronicle of the breathtaking exploits of ""Half-Cocked Jack"" Shaftoe--London street urchin turned swashbuckling adventurer and legendary King of the Vagabonds--risking life and limb for fortune and love while slowly maddening from the pox.And it is the tale of Eliza, rescued by Jack from a Turkish harem to become spy, confidante, and pawn of royals in order to reinvent Europe through the newborn power of finance.A gloriously rich, entertaining, and endlessly inventive novel that brings a remarkable age and its momentous events to vivid life, Quicksilver is an extraordinary achievement from one of the most original and important literary talents of our time.And it's just the beginning...(back cover)This P.S. edition includes 16 pages of supplementary materials.Cover design by Richard L. AquanCover illustration from the Mary Evans Picture Library; painting of Great Fire of London on stepback";"This book is just too vast to give justice to it in the few lines of this review that I might come up with now.If you are ready to read this, here are some suggestions:1) Start with Cryptonomicon first. You don't need to read this first, but it will help you get used to Stephenson's style, and you'll appreciate Quicksilver better having done so.2) Before reading Quicksilver, spend some time brushing up on some basic English history. (Did you know that London burned? Do you know what the Monmouth Rebellion was, and the Bloody Assizes that followed? Do you know about the interregnum? Do you know that William III deposed James II in a coup?) It would be nice if a timeline could be provided that summarizes the main points of English history that serve as context for this book - I admit I did not know enough myself of the history involved to get full appreciation of the book on my first reading... so now I'll have to read it again some time after doing some historical readings.Perhaps read the wikipedia page on the diary of Samuel Pepys (if not the diary itself). Although he's really just a minor figure in this novel, his diary covers many of the same events that you'll encounter in Quicksilver.3) Be prepared to deal with long digressions and elaborate descriptions. Instead of seeing them as tedious, look for the humor. Stephenson inevitably tries to put some humor into these, and although it's often very dry, it's quite amusing when you see how he's looking askance at the goings-on of the times and persons.4) Beyond the history, take care to understand the geography.5) Take some time to consider the cryptography used in the novel. When you understand just how a ""letter within a letter"" can be written, you'll appreciate more of Stephenson's particular genius.6) Even though this is hardly a science-fiction novel, it does deal largely with scientists in the Royal Society. Be prepared, then, for descriptions of events seen through the eyes of a trained scientific observer. Something as simple as the motion of a boat's mast can be used scientifically to provide information about how the boat is loaded, as you'll find in the novel. Again, these portions of the book are trademarks of Stephenson's ingenuity, and I enjoyed them immensely.7) Be patient. This is a long book, and not an easy read. If you can keep track of the main characters, you can actually put it away for a time, and return to it later to resume reading. I actually started this book some time ago, reading it only when I had uninterrupted opportunities to digest the novel. (I read other, lighter, works in the interim to keep me occupied and entertained).In fact, after starting this book, I actually began work on a Master's degree, and completed the Master's degree faster than completing the book. That was perhaps a bit too slow, but also tells more about how busy I was instead of describing the nature of the book.8) Revel in the richness of this book. It is indeed a masterpiece, and you can certainly gain more with each reread. This type of book is indeed rare, and its peculiar idiosyncrasies just make it more distinctive in its majesty, not lessening its achievement in any way.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/823.Quicksilver
Blindsight;Peter Watts;2006;2000;384;4.01;45142;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Vampires', 'Aliens', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];"Two months since the stars fell...
Two months since sixty-five thousand alien objects clenched around the Earth like a luminous fist, screaming to the heavens as the atmosphere burned them to ash. Two months since that moment of brief, bright surveillance by agents unknown.Two months of silence, while a world holds its breath.Now some half-derelict space probe, sparking fitfully past Neptune's orbit, hears a whisper from the edge of the solar system: a faint signal sweeping the cosmos like a lighthouse beam. Whatever's out there isn't talking to us. It's talking to some distant star, perhaps. Or perhaps to something closer, something en route.So who do you send to force introductions on an intelligence with motives unknown, maybe unknowable? Who do you send to meet the alien when the alien doesn't want to meet?You send a linguist with multiple personalities, her brain surgically partitioned into separate, sentient processing cores. You send a biologist so radically interfaced with machinery that he sees x-rays and tastes ultrasound, so compromised by grafts and splices he no longer feels his own flesh. You send a pacifist warrior in the faint hope she won't be needed, and the fainter one she'll do any good if she is. You send a monster to command them all, an extinct hominid predator once called vampire, recalled from the grave with the voodoo of recombinant genetics and the blood of sociopaths. And you send a synthesist--an informational topologist with half his mind gone--as an interface between here and there, a conduit through which the Dead Center might hope to understand the Bleeding Edge.You send them all to the edge of interstellar space, praying you can trust such freaks and retrofits with the fate of a world. You fear they may be more alien than the thing they've been sent to find. But you'd give anything for that to be true, if you only knew what was waiting for them...";"This is a very dense book, packed with ideas. Although Watts mentions he's a biologist by training, you wouldn't know it: between all the astronomical events, the neurological side effects of radiation and methane exposure, and the philosophy of consciousness, it feels like half a college curriculum in here. It also is not an easy book. I ended up waiting to finish it on a free day, where the book and I could spend as much time as we needed. In this way, it reminded me a great deal of Miéville's Embassytown.The narrative is fragmented into pieces, alternating between a linear description of a sort of first-contact event, and fragments of Siri's life, primarily from his youth and from his only romantic relationship. This is a future Earth where most people have been genetically engineered before birth. As they age, more and more people are choosing to join Heaven, a type of virtual reality for their consciousness, allowing their bodies to be stored elsewhere once they commit. Siri was an epileptic, and had half his brain removed to prevent further seizures. It left him with a curious sense of distance, which he developed into a skill, becoming a professional Synthesete. When an alien invention surveys Earth, a group of people are sent to the most likely place the aliens are lurking. Siri is part of that team as a professional observer.It's a complicated story, and while Watts does eventually provide many of the explanations (details on Heaven, details on vampires), it a faceted kind of story; you have to hold all these images in your mind and hope that they'll coalesce at some point. They mostly do, although there's a few spots when I think Watts has a few too many puzzle pieces to make into a coherent pattern. I was hoping for some sense of 'ah-ha,' but am instead left with a sense of both stretchy-ness and 'hmm.' The biggest idea is surrounds the idea of the brainstem, of function without consciousness.""'You think Rorschach grows them on some kind of assembly line. You can't find any genes. Maybe they are just biochemical machines.''That's what life is, Keeton. That's what you are.' Another hit of nicotine, another storm of numbers, another sample. 'Life isn't either/or. It's a matter of degree.""I will say that the first contact bits turned out to be absolutely fascinating, as well as the ideas of magnetic atmosphere and methane gases causing issues of health and perception. His discussions on game theory and first contact are depressing as hell and would probably be a real strategy by some people.Writing is occasionally transcendent. All in all, I'm going to have to bump it up after my second read. While I may not like every one, and certainly hope that humanity will do better, I have to say that this was one of the most stunning first contact stories I've ever read.Their marriage decayed with the exponential determinism of a radioactive isotope and still he sought her out, and accepted her conditions. The weakest spot for both me and my co-readers on my second read was the inclusion of the vampire species. It felt somewhat weak, and like there were other mechanisms Watts could have used to accomplish those same goals. Nonetheless, I think it's quite an amazing book, with a lot of food for thought.Of the Goodreads reviews, I would point you towards mark monday's, who addresses the philosophical angle Watts seemed to be heading toward. Lightreads also has an uncharacteristically long, but characteristically brilliant, review that includes a nice note of what the reader is in for, as well as a long segment of Watt's writing. I happen to agree with Lightreads, that I'm guessing it would read best if one is conversant with some of the -ologies in the book. Off the top of my head, linguistics, astronomy, philosophy, evolution, neurology, biology, and physics all play parts in the story.My edition included a series of mini-essays by Watts about the philosophical foundations of the book. I particularly enjoyed 'Sleight of Mind' (hacking the brain), 'Are We There Yet' (the space travel insight), alien anatomy and physiology, and 'Sentience/Intelligence,' all of which are heavily footnoted, usually with articles or journals. I laughed at footnote #130: ""This validates me, and I wish it happened more often. ¹³°130: I am by nature insecure. I blame bad parenting.""Note for later--short film Watts consulted on (5 minutes) for re-read (thanks, Caro!): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkR2h...Read again March 2021, with a lovely group of people: Nataliya, Stephen, Phil and David.

Spin;Robert Charles Wilson;2005;2000;458;4.03;41879;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Hugo Awards', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia'];"Spin is Robert Charles Wilson's Hugo Award-winning masterpiece―a stunning combination of a galactic ""what if"" and a small-scale, very human story. One night in October when he was ten years old, Tyler Dupree stood in his backyard and watched the stars go out. They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives. The effect is worldwide. The sun is now a featureless disk―a heat source, rather than an astronomical object. The moon is gone, but tides remain. Not only have the world's artificial satellites fallen out of orbit, their recovered remains are pitted and aged, as though they'd been in space far longer than their known lifespans. As Tyler, Jason, and Diane grow up, a space probe reveals a bizarre truth: The barrier is artificial, generated by huge alien artifacts. Time is passing faster outside the barrier than inside―more than a hundred million years per year on Earth. At this rate, the death throes of the sun are only about forty years in our future. Jason, now a promising young scientist, devotes his life to working against this slow-moving apocalypse. Diane throws herself into hedonism, marrying a sinister cult leader who's forged a new religion out of the fears of the masses. Earth sends terraforming machines to Mars to let the onrush of time do its work, turning the planet green. Next they send humans… and immediately get back an emissary with thousands of years of stories to tell about the settling of Mars. Then Earth's probes reveal that an identical barrier has appeared around Mars. Jason, desperate, seeds near space with self-replicating machines that will scatter copies of themselves outward from the sun―and report back on what they find. Life on Earth is about to get much, much stranger.";This. Was. Amazing.The stars and the moon disappear and nobody knows why and how...Character driven first contact with aliens with lots of science... yes please! If you enjoyed Contact by Carl Sagan, you ought to give this book a try.I don't give 5 stars that often but I'm always excited when I get to do it. This was unique, unexpected, a bit of a slow burn but I couldn't put it down.A new favorite book, I absolutely recommend it!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/910863.Spin

Now this harrowing companion novel examines the same events as they unfold in New York City, revealed through the eyes of seventeen-year-old Puerto Rican Alex Morales. When Alex's parents disappear in the aftermath of tidal waves, he must care for his two younger sisters, even as Manhattan becomes a deadly wasteland, and food and aid dwindle.With haunting themes of family, faith, personal change, and courage, this powerful new novel explores how a young man takes on unimaginable responsibilities.;"it has come to this. last week, while waiting for more books to come up to shelve, i was idly wondering if this book had come out in paperback yet. it had. so i ran downstairs, pushing folks out of the way on the escalator and making a beeline for teen fiction where i whooped and grabbed a copy. ashamed of my excitement, i made my way back upstairs, trying to figure out how the mighty had fallen. (and by mighty, i mean only those vehemently opposed to adults who read teen fiction). now, i am only opposed to adults who read teen fiction exclusively. come find me in a year or two and see what is happening then.but i thought this book would be worth a read. it is the second part of the series that describes what happens when an asteroid scootches the moon a little closer to us. tsunamis, volcanoes, panic, volcanic ash covering the sun, cold, starvation, more panic, crop death. the first one i thought was only eh. it was narrated by a kind of whiny white girl in pennsylvania suburbia. this one was supposed to have been narrated by a puerto rican teenager living in new york city! splendid, i thought - that's where i live! let's see what will happen here - maybe i can get some more end-of-world- pointers, just in case. the problem is, these two characters are interchangeable. it's true, he will occasionally blurt out a spanish phrase in the middle of his speeches. but just cuz you know a little spanish, doesn't make you authentic (pingüino). just because dave chappelle wears whiteface he doesn't then become ""white"", just hilarious. and that's this book's problem. there are times when it is hilarious. for example: the main character, a hard-working, catholic-school-attending, second-in-his-class, doing-homework-after-the-apocalypse kind of kid- this kid doesn't know how to make macaroni because of the traditional gender roles of his ethnicity?? ""it goes in a pot??"" something about his complete helplessness doesn't ring true. and mon dieu, don't get me started on the catholic thing. if i entered a church now, i would probably go up in flames, but i was indeed raised roman catholic.and i know catholics make for passive and somewhat wimpy heroes (although i saw book of eli yesterday, and that - while not being overall a great movie- had some serious badassery in it) and i totally understand the moral burden of catholicism, but this is survival, son... jesus would want you to have some canned goods. in the apocalypse, breaking into apartments from which the owners have fled is not stealing, it is persevering. you can only turn the other cheek and do unto others for so long, at some point you have to eat.and i see these catholic school kids in the store after school lets out daily. and i assume we get the nerdiest of that population because who else would come to a bookstore to hang out, manga or no manga... but if we are getting the nerdiest of the batch, the kids in this book are not among them. the kids in this book do not exist in the parochial schools of new york. maybe rhode island - somewhere more sheltered and polite. maybe.this is what kills me - the book is called ""wrenchingly plausible"" but it is in no way authentic-seeming, either in voice or occurrences. there are some scenes of mob-mentality, but it all seems like gentle-mall violence, not nyfc. and yes it is teen fiction, but so is hunger games, and that is masterful in its control of violence. and they don't seem too resourceful anyway. after reading three of the brian books by gary paulsen, i understand teen ingenuity. even though it is fiction, it has the ring of truth - his thought processes and trial-and-errors make sense. this kid doesn't seem like any urban 17-year-old i have come across in my workaday life (including the ones i shoved to get to this book), and his younger sisters are worse than useless.THIS IS WHERE I MAY BE SPOILING SOMETHING IF YOU PLAN ON READING THIS BOOK SO BEWARE AND DO NOT CROSS THIS BARRIER.i don't care how religious you are, you do not shake the hand of the man who offers to pimp out your sister and say ""no hard feelings."" dude! jesus would totally not be into that. he would allow you a little resentment. maybe a kick or two. as long as you repent...also - unrelated to child-prostitution - the same ""out"" was used as was used in the first book, for one character, to be sent somewhere ""better"" for a time, if i am remembering correctly. boo-urns for repetition.but i know that when the third book comes out, i will be pushing teen readers out of the way with a vengeance. and if the moon gets any closer, i will be breaking into your apartments to get at your canned beets. count on it. so stock up.final word: eh.come to my blog!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2169506.The_Dead_and_the_Gone

Then he and a new friend, Chip, who's also adopted, begin receiving mysterious letters. The first one says, ""You are one of the missing."" The second one says, ""Beware! They're coming back to get you.""Jonah, Chip, and Jonah's sister, Katherine, are plunged into a mystery that involves the FBI, a vast smuggling operation, an airplane that appeared out of nowhere - and people who seem to appear and disappear at will. The kids discover they are caught in a battle between two opposing forces that want very different things for Jonah and Chip's lives.Do Jonah and Chip have any choice in the matter? And what should they choose when both alternatives are horrifying?With Found, Margaret Peterson Haddix begins a new series that promises to be every bit as suspenseful as Among the Hidden, and proves her, once again, to be a master of the page-turner.";"Haddix, Margaret Peterson. 2008. The Missing Book 1: Found.I may be a bit biased--slightly--since I love, love, love Margaret Peterson Haddix. My expectations were high with this her first book in a new series. And I was NOT disappointed. I was WOWed. I'm not foolish enough to think that this one will WOW every single kid, teen, or adult out there. But for those that love science fiction and mysteries...this one is for you.Here's the opening of the prologue: ""It wasn't there. Then it was. Later, that was how Angela DuPre would describe the airplane--over and over, to one investigator after another--until she was told never to speak of it again. But when she first saw the plane that night, she wasn't thinking about mysteries or secrets.""What Angela DuPre witnessed on her first day of the job was indescribably unbelievable. Perplexing. A plane that appeared and disappeared on the runway. A plane that she found minus the pilot and flight attendants. A flight were all thirty-six passengers were babies. Sounds crazy, right? How could an unscheduled plane--a plane that did not show up on any of their radars--land on their runway to begin with? How could it have gotten there without a pilot on board? Why babies? But even more strange was the fact that once the babies were unloaded, and the proper authorities called...the plane vanished into thin air. Angela DuPre witnessed the unbelievable alright. But she wasn't crazy.The Found opens thirteen years later. Our hero is a boy named Jonah. He's got a best friend, Chip, and a slightly younger sister, Katherine. Our book opens with the arrival of several mystery letters. Two letters. Thirteen words. Lives are going to change.""You are one of the missing.""and""Beware! They're coming back to get you.""Found is a suspenseful, mysterious action-and-adventure novel that will thrill those that love science fiction. Of course I can't promise that it will ""thrill"" every reader. But I know it kept me reading. I couldn't put it down. And I was loving every minute of it. The pacing was just right. The characters were nicely developed--and are sure to improve upon with each novel that is published in the series. The only problem with the book is that it left me wanting more...wanting more now! I don't want to have to wait for the next novel to come out. I want to know what happens to Jonah and Katherine and Chip NOW! There's this intensity and immediacy that I just don't find in many other books.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1675216.Found
Judas Unchained;Peter F. Hamilton;2005;2000;827;4.3;38281;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space'];Robust, peaceful, and confident, the Commonwealth dispatched a ship to investigate the mystery of a disappearing star, only to inadvertently unleash a predatory alien species that turned on its liberators, striking hard, fast, and utterly without mercy. The Prime are the Commonwealth's worst nightmare. Coexistence is impossible with the technologically advanced aliens, who are genetically hardwired to exterminate all other forms of life. Twenty-three planets have already fallen to the invaders, with casualties in the hundreds of millions. And no one knows when or where the genocidal Prime will strike next. Nor are the Prime the only threat. For more than a hundred years, a shadowy cult, the Guardians of Selfhood, has warned that an alien with mind-control abilities impossible to detect or resist -- the Starflyer -- has secretly infiltrated the Commonwealth. Branded as terrorists, the Guardians and their leader, Bradley Johansson, have been hunted by relentless investigator Paula Myo. But now evidence suggests that the Guardians were right all along, and that the Starflyer has placed agents in vital posts throughout the Commonwealth -- agents who are now sabotaging the war effort. Is the Starflyer an ally of the Prime, or has it orchestrated a fight to the death between the two species for its own advantage? Caught between two deadly enemies, one a brutal invader striking from without, the other a remorseless cancer killing from within, the fractious Commonwealth must unite as never before...;Characters unleashing their full potential and sci-fi capabilities, while the plot is accelerating towards a bombastic showdown in many different constellations, is one of Hamilton´s favorite style vehicles. The optimistic outlook on human society can´t just be seen in the civilizations and fractions, but even in the tycoons of the future. While they, in other sci-fi and reality, are mostly the purest manifestations of evil, immediately killing billions of humans, animals, or aliens for a permille of extra revenue, Hamiltons´ mighty people use their wealth for useful and post scarcity applications, struggle with the search of the sense of life, seem sympathetic, cool, and badass with their hobbies and eccentric special activities.These lead to important plot points, research results, ideas, etc. and are a prime model, how punny, example of how Hamilton fuses characters´ motivations, actions, hobbies, preferences, etc. and plot together. While other authors have far too sharp separation lines between worldbuilding, fractions with their ideologies, and characters themselves, everything in Hamilton´s work is organic and just feels right.That´s why, in contrast to other works, where even a scifiholic like me sometimes gets exhausted, it´s always pure pleasure to read. And the well known tropes are always executed in a fresh, new light, sometimes certainly even first times of such uses of plot vehicles in the special contexts, and open the options, especially for nerds with absolutely no interest in a real life like me again, to compare how other sci-fi behemoths used it, which version and interpretation is the best, and just live in these amazing places. Sigh, how I hate being born centuries or millennia too early, but I should be thankful too, according to what I hear from the philosophizing moral guardian back there, heck.This wise, just joking, advice is added to all reviews of Hamiltons´series.One of the most fascinating aspects of Hamilton´s future vision is to see the technology and society developing in very detail over long periods of time, making a return to his universe something always stunning and inspiring. It also makes me wonder why he is the only author I know of who did this. One, who is new, lucky you, by the way, ought consider reading it in chronological order, although the series set closest to now, Salvation lost, is still unfinished, so better read before in the following order:Salvation year 2200Commonwealth year 2400The Night´s Dawn trilogy year 2700The Chronicle of the Fallers year 3400Void trilogy year 3600You can of course do as you wish, it´s just how I arrange my rereading to get the most out of it and slowly move further and further away from the boring present.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45244.Judas_Unchained

Morgan;2003;2000;366;3.93;37227;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Audiobook', 'Thriller', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy'];"Welcome back to the brash, brutal new world of the twenty-fifth century: where global politics isn’t just for planet Earth anymore; and where death is just a break in the action, thanks to the techno-miracle that can preserve human consciousness and download it into one new body after another.Cynical, quick-on-the-trigger Takeshi Kovacs, the ex-U.N. envoy turned private eye, has changed careers - and bodies - once more... trading sleuthing for soldiering as a warrior-for-hire, and helping a far-flung planet’s government put down a bloody revolution.But when it comes to taking sides, the only one Kovacs is ever really on is his own. So when a rogue pilot and a sleazy corporate fat cat offer him a lucrative role in a treacherous treasure hunt, he’s only too happy to go AWOL with a band of resurrected soldiers of fortune. All that stands between them and the ancient alien spacecraft they mean to salvage are a massacred city bathed in deadly radiation, unleashed nanotechnolgy with a million ways to kill, and whatever surprises the highly advanced Martian race may have in store. But armed with his genetically engineered instincts, and his trusty twin Kalashnikovs, Takeshi is ready to take on anything — and let the devil take whoever’s left behind.";A very different book from Altered Carbon. And not nearly as good. Is this one of those cases where a successful author isn't subject to as much editorial control?A difference that doesn't bother me is that Broken Angels is more SF and less murder mystery than Altered Carbon. But then there's the rest:1. He has. This. Really annoying. Use. Of. Periods. To show pauses. Or something. Which is not only distracting but also makes it hard to parse. The sentences. Hey. Richard. Try an. Ellipsis. Or. An em dash. Or maybe just let the reader figure out the subtleties of phrasing on their own, like most writers do. You're not writing stage direction.2. The sex in the first book fit with the plot. The sex in the second book seemed more because the author wants to get his Kovacs character laid. I also get somewhat of an impression that the author is revealing his own appetites, which makes me uncomfortable.3. The body count is just ridiculous. And that's not even counting the war in the background.4. There's discontinuity. He's mooning over a character from Altered Carbon that he wasn't actually mooning over at the end of that book. Granted, Our Hero musing over lost love or the like may serve to offer character depth for a reader who didn't read the first book, but for me it was grating.Meh.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/279561.Broken_Angels

Witness to history. Friend. Daughter. Human. Seventeen years old.Everyone on Earth knows the tale I am part of. But you don't know my tale: How I did what I did — how I did what I had to do — not just to stay alive but to keep you alive, too. All of you. I'm going to tell it to you now, the only way I know how: not straight but true, the whole thing, to try make you feel what I felt: the joy and terror and uncertainty, panic and wonder, despair and hope. Everything that happened, bringing us to Earth, and Earth out of its captivity. All through my eyes.It's a story you know. But you don't know it all.;"John Scalzi: Young Adult Author?YES! this enjoyable book was not just enjoyable for its story, but also for how it helped me realize that John Scalzi has been writing like a YA author since the beginning of his career. it just took an actual YA novel penned by him for me to realize that.he has so much in common with the modern YA authors I've read:- pleasant but generic writing style that has no interest in impressing its reader with challenging prose- pleasant characters who are sympathetic but who also lack a certain depth and richness- pleasingly critical of various oppressive, individuality-deadening structures and systems and institutions yet not particularly nuanced in that critique- lack of in-depth details in his descriptions. Scalzi has never met an alien or even a setting that he's wanted to actually describe.- focus on simple but resonant emotions with which the reader can quickly identifyall of those things have somewhat bothered me during readings of prior novels in this series. they bothered me, but not enough for me to actually dislike the books. just enough to give them 3 stars - much like I give most YA novels I've read (although I should point out that, for me, 3 stars actually means ""I Liked It"", unlike many other goodreads reviewers. *cough*).that YA style is a perfect fit for Zoe's Tale, which is a story recounted by a teenage protagonist. it runs parallel to John Perry's story in the prior novel, except from his daughter's perspective. many readers have expressed frustration with what they see as a ""pointless"" story, one that's already been told. I'd like to take this book and smack those readers across the head with it (lightly). are they reading just for narrative thrills? do different perspectives not interest them? that's like reading by checking off boxes on a narrative checklist and I don't get that. plotline is just one thing in a book. as far as the 4 books in this series I've read so far, this one is my favorite.Scalzi does a great job with Zoe and her voice. she feels real. she's special, sure, but I love how Scalzi doesn't make her amazingly unique and secretly powerful and super duper extra-special. she's a teenage girl like many teenage girls (and boys). she's excitable, often melodramatic, knows a lot more than people thinks she knows, puts up a tough front, spends a lot of time thinking about the boy she likes, and spends even more time thinking about the person she thinks she is and would like to be. insular and open; snarky and genuine. the strange, remote alien companions of The Last Colony are transformed into adorable sidekicks when seen through Zoe's eyes. and the romance that is barely glimpsed in the prior book takes center stage in this one, starting off as eye-rollingly predictable but ending up as genuinely moving.this book answers many questions raised in The Last Colony but it still feels separate - and it's an equally worthy novel. the political intrigues are replaced by an emotional journey that ends in a simplistic but resonant triumph of the spirit for Zoe. a familiar but timeless lesson is learned and earned: in the end, Zoe realizes that she is her own person and doesn't belong in any box that has been built for her; she must forge her own path. that's so classic Young Adult.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2102600.Zoe_s_Tale

Anxious to compete, Russian prospectors commissioned inventor Leviticus Blue to create a great machine that could mine through Alaska’s ice. Thus was Dr. Blue’s Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine born.But on its first test run the Boneshaker went terribly awry, destroying several blocks of downtown Seattle and unearthing a subterranean vein of blight gas that turned anyone who breathed it into the living dead.Now it is sixteen years later, and a wall has been built to enclose the devastated and toxic city. Just beyond it lives Blue’s widow, Briar Wilkes. Life is hard with a ruined reputation and a teenaged boy to support, but she and Ezekiel are managing. Until Ezekiel undertakes a secret crusade to rewrite history.His quest will take him under the wall and into a city teeming with ravenous undead, air pirates, criminal overlords, and heavily armed refugees. And only Briar can bring him out alive.;"``Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. -- I assure you the anti-gravity hoverchannel is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.'' Eliza was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. She unstrapt herself from her leather seat restraints and stood, careful to maintain her balance as the airship encountered turbulence. When she entered the hoverchannel, she activated the polarity redistribution magnets within her combat suit and began floating comfortably around the perimeter of the foyer. Miss Bingley's attention was quite engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through his book, so much so that at one point she nearly navigated the ship into the side of Pemberley; and she was perpetually making some inquiry. At length, finally exhausted by her tenacious attempts to force a conversation regarding his book, Darcy relented. ""It's entitled Boneshaker. An American novel."" ""What do you think of it?"" Eliza said as she drifted by.  ""A bit nonsensical, really. Steampunk claptrap about the Civil War going on much longer than it actually did, which caused technological advances that didn't really happen until much later. And a zombie-infested city called Seattle. It has been blocked off from the rest of the country, and our heroine must go in to rescue her foolish son.""  Mr. Bingley crossed the room, his steam-powered mechanical legs stomping their way across the carpet to the cabinet where he refilled his glass. ""Zombies in America? That does sound quite silly. Everyone knows that zombies are native to Britain. That's how I lost my legs."" ""Please, Bingley, don't tell us that old story again,"" Mr. Hurst said, adjusting himself on the sofa before falling back asleep. Darcy said, ""The plot moves along at a good pace, but the characters are a bit uninspired. A teenage boy constantly doing something inadvisable; the protective mother, blasting zombies and trying to save him."" Eliza smiled. ""Darcy, certainly you aren't saying literature is full of strong female characters who run around rescuing male characters."" ""Nor should it be,"" Mr. Hurst said, drifting slowly in and out of consciousness. Ignoring Mr. Hurst's interjection, Darcy said, ""I suppose the fairer sex aren't shown in powerful roles that often, even in these books written in the far future about the distant past . . . er, or perhaps about the same time as now . . . When were we written?"" Miss Bingley inquired, ""Are you sure the dinner agreed with you?"" ""I feel fine, thank you,"" Darcy said.  ""Admit it,"" Sherlock Holmes said, standing in the doorway, Watson at his side. ""You enjoy all the fashionable gimmicks flying left and right, and the pace keeps you entertained. Yet you wonder why nothing surprising was done with any of these elements."" Darcy moved over as Holmes sat on the sofa beside him, lighting a pipe. ""You're right, Holmes. The whole reinvention of the Civil War is fascinating in theory. Then the author does nothing with it. The book has nothing to say. No reflections on the civil war, racism, or politics. Nor does it say anything about the true nature of zombies. In fact, it says little about love, which is the very heart of the story."" J. K. Rowling, refilling her glass of zinfandel, said, ""And it's practically a young adult novel, isn't it? Other than one or two mildly violent zombie moments and one four letter 'S' word, this could be the next film from Pixar. There's not even a gay sorcerer to throw off the prudes.""  Darcy met Eliza's eyes as she orbited the room. ""Have you read it as well, Miss Bennett?"" ""Braaaains,"" Mr. Hurst moaned softly.""I found it diverting,"" Eliza said. ""I always read the books nominated for the Nebula awards. But, like you, I found the novel didn't meet my expectations. When you look beyond the stylish trappings, you have a run-of-the-mill adventure story written in a workmanlike fashion. I imagine the query letter was spectacular, though."" Darcy was on the verge of speaking when Mr. Hurst lunged up from the sofa, saliva splattering from his vicious maw, his eyes sunken in and rolled back into his head. He lurched across the room toward Bingley, whose back was facing him. Eliza kicked off of the wall and rolled over to Darcy, pulling his pistol from his belt, and fired several rounds through Mr. Hurst's head. A splatter of blood, brain and skull chips showered down on Harold Bloom. ""Well,"" Mr. Harold Bloom said, wiping blood from his face and wiping it on the sofa, ""that was entirely unnecessary, but what HASN'T been? The whole book review is sound and fury, signifying nothing. And how many times is this hack going to parody Pride and Prejudice? He seems to think it's much more funny than it is, just as Oscar Wilde thought himself hilarious, when he is in fact highly over-esteemed."" Holmes puffed his pipe, a gray cloud of smoke rising above him. ""I can't believe I didn't notice Mr. Hurst was turning. Usually I'm so attentive to details."" ""Nobody's perfect,"" Darcy said. ""Would you mind putting that pipe out? We are in a zeppelin, you know."" Holmes sighed and stood up, pulling on his overcoat. ""I'm going next door to the Kurt Vonnegut review. Pipe smoking is encouraged over there.""  And as Holmes left the room, suddenly the review stopped.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1137215.Boneshaker

In the midst of this rose a new Sith, Darth Bane, who recognized that the Sith Order would fall if nothing was done. Thus it was he who, learning to cultivate patience and cunning, hid from the strife until it was over, and then rose to become the most powerful Sith Lord ever.This is the story of the transformation of Des, a young miner, into the legendary Sith Lord Darth Bane. Des - like many of the disenfranchised who live on the Outer Rim - is disillusioned with the stagnancy of the Old Republic. When the Sith unite to bring the Republic down, Des is one of many to join their cause. His heroism and skill in battle - along with his remarkable connection to the Force - draw the notice of the Sith Masters, and Des eventually finds himself studying at the Sith Academy on Korriban. He takes the name of Bane and, amidst the deception and back-stabbing of the other students, he learns to unlock his latent dark-side talents. As his power grows, Bane realizes the Sith have lost their way. Under the leadership of Lord Kaan and his Brotherhood of Darkness, the Sith have turned their back on the true nature of the dark side. Through manipulation, cunning and strength, Bane destroys Kaan's Brotherhood and wipes out all the other Sith so he can found a new Order based on the rule of two: one Master, one apprentice.;"""Equality is a myth to protect the weak. Some of us are strong in the Force, others are not. Only a fool believes otherwise.""Once upon a time, in the days of Ajunta Pall and Marka Ragnos, of Revan and Vitiate, the Sith were always united under one great leader. A brutal hierarchy of Force-users, masters of the dark side, with the most powerful of them claiming the glorious mantle of the Dark Lord of the Sith. But those days are gone. In the wake of their passing stands Skere Kaan and the Brotherhood of Darkness, a fraternity of equals throwing their combined might against the Republic and its Jedi defenders...On the desolate planet of Apatros, a lowly miner named Dessel is on the run from Republic forces. In desperation he joins the ranks of the armies of the Brotherhood of Darkness. But his true destiny is unknown even to him, for young Dessel will be known to the galaxy by another name. And it is under that name that he becomes one of the most powerful men ever to embrace the Dark Side of the Force...Most of you probably know by now how I feel about Star Wars. Best sci-fi ever, most fascinating fictional universe ever, and all that. Well, the three books making up this trilogy are my favourite Star Wars novels. I've read quite a few of those, but none of the others can match the amazement I felt while reading Path of Destruction, Rule of Two and Dynasty of Evil.The Star Wars Expanded Universe by now contains a whole bunch of different eras, all with their own stories, whether told in movies, books, comics or games. Ever since I played this amazingly wonderful video game called Knights of the Old Republic (aka the best video game ever made), I was addicted to the time period known as the Old Republic era, where Jedi and Sith fought each other in the thousands, and relics of the light and the dark were unearthed on ancient planets like Tython and Korriban.The Darth Bane trilogy takes place at the very end of that era. In many ways, it is like the connecting bridge between the movies and the Old Republic era. Because of that, I would strongly recommend both watching the movies and playing and reading through the games and novels of the main bulk of the Old Republic era before starting these. It is, of course, possible to do without, but I believe it would take away a lot of the enjoyment.""Two there shall be; no more, no less. One to embody the dark side, the other to crave it.""Well then, to the reasons why this trilogy is absodamnlutely amazing. First of all, it is written from the point of view of the Sith, the big bad villains themselves. There are a few other POV characters jumping in here and there, but mostly this series is meant to give the reader insight into the minds of those who desire to master the Dark Side of the Force, and to use it to take power for themselves.Second, Drew Karpyshyn is a master of characterisation. He just happens to also be the lead writer for Knights of the Old Republic, (my loving this book has of course nothing at all to do with that), and those who have played BioWare games know how brilliant those guys are at creating deep and fascinating characters.There are not particularly many characters in this series, but those who do appear definitely make up for that. Darth Bane himself is one of the most interesting characters in the Star Wars universe. As a rarity among EU characters, he was originally created by George Lucas himself, but Karpyshyn forges him into a protagonist I'll never forget. His young apprentice Zannah is one of my all-time favourite Star Wars characters. And throw in people like the relentless Jedi generals Hoth and Valenthyne Farfalla, the Princess Serra of Doan and Lord Skere Kaan, the charismatic leader of the Brotherhood of Darkness, and you have a most memorable bunch of people. As a taste, have a look at some of Zannah's thoughts:“I'm not going to hurt you, Quano,” she promised. “I'm not like him.” He enjoys hurting people. I only hurt people if I see some way to profit from their suffering.This trilogy is some of the best this universe has to offer. Vicious betrayals, relics containing the spirits of ancient Sith, and lightsaber duels more awesome than any I've ever encountered.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35430.Path_of_Destruction

Dent, Trillian, Ford, Zaphod and Random, are miraculously saved from the destruction of the planet and they travel to Nano, a little refuge with the last survivors of Earth. But this idyllic oasis in the middle of the universe has some problems; mainly, the humans living in it. Some good moments and funny scenes. In all honesty an entertaining reading, but far from being anything memorable. Does helps a lot to remove some of the awful aftertaste of the dismal ending in book #5.It’s a rare thing when an author tries to continue the legacy of a previous one. Many find just the idea of it preposterous, so there’s a lot of unjustified hate for this book, and the author. Personally I reserve my contempt not for authors that merely try, but for those who try and fail miserably at it. And I truly think Eoin Colfer is not one of those cases. Sure there are noticeable differences in style and whatnot, and no one will ever replace the beloved one and only Douglas Adams. But in the vast land of imitations, I dare to admit Colfer is at the very least a decent try.Would the late Douglas Adams approve this? We’ll never know. But his surviving widow did, and one would think she’s the one that knew him best in life. So maybe that means something.Some people consider this book part of the series, others do not. I find the discussion moot. Like I’ve said before, for me it all ended hea in #4.-----------------------------------------------

Now, brought to life for the first time, here is the full story of that glorious, doomed conflict.While the brutal Covenant juggernaut sweeps inexorably through space, intent on wiping out humankind, only one stronghold remains--the planet Reach. Practically on Earth's doorstep, it is the last military fortress to defy the onslaught.

It is the training ground for the very first ""super soldiers.""

Morgan has already established himself as an SF author of global significance.Takeshi Kovacs has come home. Home to Harlan's World. An ocean planet with only 5 percent of its landmass poking above the dangerous and unpredictable seas. Try and get above the weather in anything more sophisticated than a helicopter and the Martian orbital platforms will burn you out of the sky.And death doesn't just wait for you in the seas and the skies. On land, from the tropical beaches and swamps of Kossuth to the icy, machine-infested wastes of New Hokkaido the hard won gains of the Quellist revolution have been lost. The First Families, the corporations and the Yakuza have a stranglehold on everything.Embarked on a journey of implacable retribution for a lost love, Kovacs is blown off course and into a maelstrom of political intrigue and technological mystery as the ghosts of Harlan's World and his own violent past rise to claim their due. Quellcrist Falconer is back from the dead, they say and hunting her down for the First Families is a savage young Envoy called Kovacs who's been in storage.;Some times a book doesn’t get to be judged as a stand-alone work. When it’s the third book in a loosely connected series featuring the same lead character, what happens in books one and two are going to affect book three’s read. After enjoying Broken Angels (second in the series, review here), I immediately requested Woken Furies from the library. Sadly, it was a serious disappointment both as a series installment and as a stand-alone read.

Ilium;Dan Simmons;2003;2000;731;4.04;30744;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Mythology', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook'];The Trojan War rages at the foot of Olympos Mons on Mars—observed and influenced from on high by Zeus and his immortal family—and twenty-first-century professor Thomas Hockenberry is there to play a role in the insidious private wars of vengeful gods and goddesses. On Earth, a small band of the few remaining humans pursues a lost past and devastating truth—as four sentient machines depart from Jovian space to investigate, perhaps terminate, the potentially catastrophic emissions emanating from a mountaintop miles above the terraformed surface of the Red Planet.;Time to pimp ones´ mythological session with some sci-fi elements. Some people don´t see this one as the same ingenious work as Hyperion and Endymion and I don´t get why. It´s not that über, true, but it´s still some of the best a science fantasy hybrid reader can wish for. There is, for instance, and as far as I know, nothing of the same quality and perfection that combines mythology with sci-fi, fantasy with space opera style fractions, and in general dares to dance at many genre weddings.Retelling classic tales, Simmons uses very different technological levels of fractions, old evil, decadence, some grain of quantum, and the splendid characterization to describe one a bit different Trojan war. Although the certainty that much or most of human history isn´t just ancient fake news written by the winners isn´t that big.Gods playing with tiny, unimportant immortals is always such a fun, especially when a big surprise about the background of this free time, or full time, entertainment is unveiled. Now one could go different philosophical sci-fi routes for why aliens, gods, future humans via time travel, AIs simulating the universe, etc. should do this, because of boredom, for research, ancestor simulations, as a show, because they are mentally sick and that´s what future psychiatric therapies are like, simulating for getting sane again.Apropos, philosophy, there is again so much extra easter egg goodie fun hidden by the highly bibliophile author, that especially classic and mythology prone readers might find their Elysium, or whatever version of heaven they prefer, maybe even nasty hellish versions of it, with it, everyone´s personal choice, I don´t judge. The reason why this might not be seen as as groundbreaking as Hyperion is that it´s more fantasy and thereby, of course, not that complex, interwoven, and big as the space opera fantasy hybrid Hyperion was. Still, a fascinating work with extra seductiveness for history nerds.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3973.Ilium

The only hope for humanity lies in the recovery of a secret cache of doomsday weapons -and a renegade named Clavain who is determined to find them. But other factions want the weapons for their own purposes - and the weapons themselves have another agenda altogether...;Trying to break free from potential extinction by quarreling about the right use of alternative, time travel induced, defense options.The philosophical implications of what good leadership could look like are immense. Would it be right to limit the civil liberties of some groups to avoid disadvantages for all the others in the long term? That´s seen as followed:The Inhibitors are killing anything too intelligent with expansionary mentalities that could form larger empires and control everything for two reasons: First, they want to avoid one species assimilating and, or killing all others. Second, they have a larger plan to avoid a galaxy collision eons in the future that would also kill all if there is too much wildlife crawling around and sabotaging collective attempts by free will.  So are they really crazy, evil, malfunctioning, or have just read too much wacky human economic and political texts from between the 18th and 23rd century?The main plot is a bit complicated, interwoven, and seems to be building on the premise that the reader knows at least a bit about the universe or has already read one of the previous novels. It´s also missing a bit more of the epic proportions, settings, and general action. Still an exceptional, incomparable read, but it could have been much more.Good, old doomsday weapons, who has the legitimization to build, steal, use, reverse engineer, and talk to them? I have a very strong tendency to deem one of the contrary beliefs shown in 2 opposing main characters stupid and the other one wise, but there may be many individual interpretations and no certainty about right or wrong, again suffering of some for the sake of all, or, the most pretentious, naive, and dangerous attitude, not building more or even destroying the weapons one already has. Sure, great idea, it´s not as if Earth would have been covered in endless wars without the nuclear option and I am sure that alien civilizations will have many reasons not to kill, destroy, and afterward mine anything they find interesting if there is no MAD doctrine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_...in the background. There are many profound reasons for why this would work, for instance, unicorns, rainbows, lollypops, and freaking genocides. As so often, I am not sure about a potential second layer behind the characters' motivations, if Reynolds implemented some subtle innuendos about ideologies I have no interest in because they are so stupid or if it are just pure extrapolations of what might happen in the future and how fractions could form. He avoids philosophizing about current and past mentalities, just shows the more or less logical standpoints of characters and fractions, mostly influenced by how they deal with tech. It seems as if humanities and social science don´t really play a role in the more dystopian future, but especially some of the rare hereof descriptions of Demarchists, Ultras, Conjoiners,... show that there is far more potential for not just letting them fight and research, but debate, show more details of their worlds, generally world build more towards some of the less hard sciency elements. That´s not Reynolds´ style, intend, or interest, but the universe could be far much more profound if anything living would have had more than just sockpuppet function to accelerate the plot with cliffhangers, fast cuts, and rare real emotions.Some other elements are long time range attack space battles, hyper pigs going to war, the melting captain, some mindscrews by metaphysical, technological, and physical factors, how primitive human high tech seems in contrast to real magnitude, be it quantity, quality, or, most important factor, time. What a short time we use to be sentient, semi intelligent beings and that something could be already thinking, evolving, and researching for billions of years.I´ve already said this before, don´t start reading Reynolds without the will to skip very hard science descriptions, historical lectures about aliens evolutions, and the general lengths of a book focused and detailed descriptions of a dark, broken future.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89190.Redemption_Ark
Horus Rising;Dan Abnett;2006;2000;416;4.23;29171;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', '40k', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'War'];After thousands of years of expansion and conquest, the human Imperium is at its height. His dream for humanity accomplished, the Emperor hands over the reins of power to his Warmaster, Horus, and heads back to Terra. But is Horus strong enough to control his fellow commanders and continue the Emperor's grand design, or will such incredible power corrupt him?;"So on the one hand (i.e., the overly hairy, knuckle-dragging one), this is Manwich-sized chunk of meaty, SF gun-porn dripping with sweat and oozing locker-room musk. HOWEVER, on the other manicured, latte- holding hand, this is a quality, well written tale with surprising character depth and a layered plot with real complexity and an unusual amount of nuance for a popcorn page-turner. At the risk of a DUH moment, let me point out that this is Warhammer 40000 tie in. I knew nothing about the Warhammer 40K universe before picking up this book…nothing. Therefore, if you’ve thought about checking out the series but didn’t know where to begin…TA DA…you have found your entry vehicle. If you haven’t thought about checking out the series, keep reading and you may change your mind. Here’s a quick back-story and plot summary...
BACK STORY 
This story is the first of a series that takes place 10000 years before the main Warhammer 40K events and explains how the galactic civil war (known as the Horus Heresy) got started. It’s the 31st Millennium. Thousands of years ago mankind scattered from Earth in a great Diaspora and populated the stars. For the last 2 centuries, the Imperium of Man guided by the iron-fisted, blood dripping  benevolent hand of the immortal Emperor has been conducting the Great Crusade in order to (1) reunite all of the various groups of humans (whether they want to or not) and (2) exterminate all alien life from the galaxy. Assisting the Emperor in his violent conquest mighty endeavor are the Space Marines, Seven and a half foot tall, genetically enhanced, immortal super soldiers in battle armor that would make Boba Fett full of dark green envy. Chief among the Space Marines are the ruling “Primarchs,” NINE FOOT tall genetically enhanced, immortal super DUPER soldiers who eat bad-ass and crap awesome. 
PLOT SUMMARY
The Emperor has unexpectedly left the front lines of the Great Crusade and returned to Earth (maybe for some celebratory rape and pillaging). In his place, the Emperor has raised his favorite Primarch, Horus, to the rank of War Master and put him in complete control over the mission and the other primarchs. This development does not sit well with some of the other 9 foot nasties and schemes, plots, rumors, conspiracies, machinations, cabals, ops and maneuvers ensue. We following the Great Crusade under Horus through a series of conquests while learning about the back-story of the Imperium and watching the Space Marines in action (some very, very cool scenes by the way). At the same time, events begin to unfold that set the stage for the conflict that will develop as the series progresses, leading eventually to the split between Horus and the Emperor and the beginning of the great civil war. 
THOUGHTS
This book is a blast and I had a lot of fun reading it. However, it was also quite a bit more and that’s what I found surprising. While there are certainly a number of stock characters and not everyone gets evenly developed, the main players are drawn with considerable depth and distinct personalities. This is not exactly an easy thing to do dealing with soldiers that physically are almost identical. In addition, the exploration of religion and philosophy and the arguments on these themes from multiple viewpoints added a nice layer to the plot. The writing is certainly better than what I anticipated and was of high quality. Abnett has a crisp, easy flow to his prose and is able to write both with humor and the darker emotions as called for by the narrative. I was impressed enough with his writing that I will seek out other books he’s written as I enjoy his style. Finally, I thought the idea of the Museum of Conquest (i.e., a huge starship where examples of every alien race exterminated are preserved for posterity) was diabolically cool. Didn’t have anything to do with the story, but was just one of those concepts that add to the overall back-story and that I found clever. Overall, this is highly entertaining. This is one of those that if you think you would enjoy it based on the plot description or the subject matter, than I am confident that you will. It is an easy, breezy read loaded with action and enough depth to raise it above the norm.4.0 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/625603.Horus_Rising
House of Suns;Alastair Reynolds;2008;2000;512;4.24;29030;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];Six million years ago, at the dawn of the star-faring era, Abigail Gentian fractured herself into a thousand male and female clones, which she called shatterlings. But now, someone is eliminating the Gentian line. Campion and Purslane—two shatterlings who have fallen in love and shared forbidden experiences—must determine exactly who, or what, their enemy is, before they are wiped out of existence.;Clone family meeting galactically gone wrong.One of Reynolds´single novels, it deals with immortality, childhood trauma through alternative upbringing involving simulations and AIs, an option how conglomerates could evolve, machine intelligence in the form of old and new robots, a crime in the past, future torture methods, and thereby unites anything that makes Sci-Fi great.Childhood memories have already played an essential role in Chasm City, where it was part of showing the special attitude and shock frosted living cargo weight minimization attempts of Sky Hausmann. In this case, simulations, AI, agents, and upbringing optimization could be influenced by one, to avoid spoiler, of the offered options: hacking, secret use, AI gone sentient, agent gone mad, etc. However, the possibilities are manifold, but there seems to be not much difference between being brought up by mad, flesh parents or wacky artificial teachers. The element of upbringing with partial or total help of AI is already a bit of a controversial topic nowadays, especially because it includes dismantling and depreciating motherhood just as any other aspect of human uniqueness and ingenuity because, sorry for that sad truth, machines and AI are already better in some fields and there is no reason why they shouldn´t outstrip humans in every possible aspect. It´s sick and disturbing, but if a perfect android could, in a few centuries or millennia, teach, rear, and educate babies and kids with perfection humans are incapable of (no 24/7, jobs, mood fluctuation, no technology to detect any emotion, bodily function of the kid, etc.) the naturally upbrought kids would always fail in comparison. But hey, if the cyborgs look exactly like the parents, they could assist them and the important bonding and conditioning on certain faces is still there, so where could be a problem? Hopeless romantics should learn to deal with that sooner or later.How to explore space is a question of money, private or public sponsoring, the motivation of colonization, war, research, asteroid mining aka resources (much easier than mining on planets), or good, oldfashioned discovery addiction, although that´s a rare anomaly. These aren´t rare too and Reynolds plays his astrophysics profession card more wisely and less hardcore than in the Revelation Space series, making it easier to follow, more focused on the great and heavily interwoven plot, so be focused while reading not to oversee the premises because Reynolds likes to puzzle with tiny pieces and each knows it´s place. And there is an old crime, a new crime, a mysterious old alien civilization, machine people, the spirit of the air, childhood trauma, epic boss battles, and Reynolds trademark badass character attitudes, cool dialogues, everything. The technology is far higher developed, duh, as a few million years have passed since today, but Reynolds is still focusing on technical and physical accuracy, making the theoretical machines, engines, and weapons as science based and related to theoretical physics as possible.Bio- and nanotechnology and its possible uses, misuses, and funny accidents with it are a recurring theme in his work, Melding plague, Greenfly, abilities of machines, etc, and one of the most fascinating aspects of Sci-Fi, be it in worldbuilding, abilities, or the effects on protagonists if they more or less willingly transform. Just take real life examples from biology, viruses, intelligence in insect colonies,… or technology, viruses again, microscopic robots,... Again a question of when, not if.Some readers may definitively be disappointed because it´s still very detailed and filled with science facts, characterization, dialogues, and whatever protagonist keen readers are into is secondary after the worldbuilding, fractions, retrospections, and especially the families and the idea of how wealth could keep accumulating in space. Families, Lines in this work, and old money that are specializing in future industries in one sector and becoming galactic or universal market leaders can be one option, but I would subjectively think that conglomerates and especially single, market listed megacorporations that are the first ones and have extremely rigid and deadly anti industrial espionage systems will be king. These strange entities are already almighty powers on earth and the greed of their founders will lead to speculation and stocks, taking away the power from the founding mothers and fathers and giving it to the uncontrollable market. I guess future aliens will have much fun playing around with the most important factor of human society just as nowadays secret reptilian overlords that are already there. The novel is one of the best entry points to Reynold´s amazing work, because it has at least 10 unforgettable moments, is, as mentioned, not as complex and interwoven as his other works (and there are no flaws in character´s motivations and motives), and deals with a pretty fresh and unused plot idea I´ve still not seen in such detail.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1126719.House_of_Suns

Now an even greater danger has surfaced: a threat to the existence of the universe itself.At the very heart of the galaxy is the Void, a self-contained microuniverse that cannot be breached, cannot be destroyed, and cannot be stopped as it steadily expands in all directions, consuming everything in its path: planets, stars, civilizations. The Void has existed for untold millions of years. Even the oldest and most technologically advanced of the galaxy’s sentient races, the Raiel, do not know its origin, its makers, or its purpose.But then Inigo, an astrophysicist studying the Void, begins dreaming of human beings who live within it. Inigo’s dreams reveal a world in which thoughts become actions and dreams become reality. Inside the Void, Inigo sees paradise. Thanks to the gaiafield, a neural entanglement wired into most humans, Inigo’s dreams are shared by hundreds of millions–and a religion, the Living Dream, is born, with Inigo as its prophet. But then he vanishes.Suddenly there is a new wave of dreams. Dreams broadcast by an unknown Second Dreamer serve as the inspiration for a massive Pilgrimage into the Void. But there is a chance that by attempting to enter the Void, the pilgrims will trigger a catastrophic expansion, an accelerated devourment phase that will swallow up thousands of worlds.And thus begins a desperate race to find Inigo and the mysterious Second Dreamer. Some seek to prevent the Pilgrimage; others to speed its progress–while within the Void, a supreme entity has turned its gaze, for the first time, outward...";1,5k millennia from now, in the year 3600, the most future set series takes place in a science fantasy mixture just as Hamiltons´milestone debut The Night´s Dawn trilogy. I deem this visions of future worlds not just entertaining and, depending on the author, very educating, but really important too, because these are real mirrors in a future we, probably let me once be optimistic please, won´t see anymore, but can help reducing or increasing the possibility of it being a dystopia or utopia. That doesn´t seem far fetched, honestly, no matter if you are more the mind virus epigenetic spread type or an old fashioned one, making own little versions of oneself. Both exponentially grows, greatgreatgreatgreat etc. kids, or the much quicker spread of activism, knowledge, progressive social and governmental change, really everyone can make a difference. Of course, there is the dark hate side too, but who would openly admit to roll that way.The use of physics as a plot device has hardly ever been both that fun and well used, because not just the single characters´ and whole fractions´ motivations are logical and credible, but the whole dynamic of an unpreventable danger related to psi fantasy science, and later switching between settings and showing the different consequences, is dense and always surprising.It´s, so far in Hamilton´s amazing universe, the series set farthest away in the future, with highly advanced humankind still helpless against the laws of physics and the universe, which is showing naked primitive apes who is boss, although the not so smart population is great at creating unnecessary, artificial problems themselves too.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...This wise, just joking, advice is added to all reviews of Hamiltons´series.One of the most fascinating aspects of Hamilton´s future vision is to see the technology and society developing in very detail over long periods of time, making a return to his universe something always stunning and inspiring. It also makes me wonder why he is the only author I know of who did this. One, who is new, lucky you, by the way, ought consider reading it in chronological order, although the series set closest to now, Salvation lost, is still unfinished, so better read before in the following order:Salvation year 2200Commonwealth year 2400The Night´s Dawn trilogy year 2700The Chronicle of the Fallers year 3400Void trilogy year 3600You can of course do as you wish, it´s just how I arrange my rereading to get the most out of it and slowly move further and further away from the boring present.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/866136.The_Dreaming_Void

For one brother it means a desperate flight, and a search for the one - maybe two - people who could clear his name. For his brother it means a life lived under constant threat of treachery and murder. And for their sister, it means returning to a place she'd thought abandoned forever.Only the sister is not what she once was; Djan Seriy Anaplian has become an agent of the Culture's Special Circumstances section, charged with high-level interference in civilisations throughout the greater galaxy.Concealing her new identity - and her particular set of abilities - might be a dangerous strategy. In the world to which Anaplian returns, nothing is quite as it seems; and determining the appropriate level of interference in someone else’s war is never a simple matter.";Like an onion or a profound human, the many layers of shellworlds and similar superstructures may give living space to trillion of human or whatever alien beings in the future. Reread 2022 with extended review  Under each crust is a special species tasteOne of the most mindblowing features may be to mix different physics, geology, biology, mentality, and prosperity in each shell, open the gates from time to time to let them fight or cuddle and interbreed, how tentacly naughty, with each other and to manage everything with an AI-controlled, almighty, self-replicating, permanently morphing infrastructure that uses probability calculation and coincidences to let the system run smoothly. And that just for the only reason to generate data, knowledge, or entertainment for the ones running the shellworlds/amusement park studies. A bit of altruism in the cosmic zoo, please.Another option and motivation for the builders of such megastructures might be enabling alien races to develop and evolve in different or optimized or hellish living conditions and form endless, ideological bloodlines by giving the species more and more power until they can begin uplifting or genociding others in neverending circles of revenge and vendettas. And some theoretical physics too, pleaseThere are many concepts for megastructures, some including the use of black holes, suns, etc., directly built inside, or better said around, those space anomalies to get endless energy. And all of it will be needed for such large scale building projects, including all the manipulation of physics, artificial gravity, and suns and the avoidance of system errors and computer bugs that could wipe out a whole or some civilizations at once. Of course just as long as cosmic voodoo economics allows if, if not, it will stay impossible, dubious hard science forever in eternity until payday or galactic tax declaration. Special physics for special circumstancesBanks´ legendary Special Circumstances are around too to make the reading the ultimate Sci-Fi overkill.

Look to Windward;Iain M. Banks;2000;2000;496;4.22;27558;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Cultural', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Speculative Fiction'];"The Twin Novae battle had been one of the last of the Idiran war, one of the most horrific. Desperate to avert defeat, the Idirans had induced not one but two suns to explode, snuffing out worlds & biospheres teeming with sentient life. They were attacks of incredible proportion - gigadeathcrimes. But the war ended and life went on. Now, 800 years later, light from the 1st explosion is about to reach the Masaq' Orbital, home to the Culture's most adventurous & decadent souls. There it will fall upon Masaq's 50 billion inhabitants, gathered to commemorate the deaths of the innocent & to reflect, if only for a moment, on what some call the Culture's own complicity in the terrible event.Also journeying to Masaq' is Major Quilan, an emissary from the war-ravaged world of Chel. In the aftermath of the conflict that split his world apart, most believe he has come to Masaq' to bring home Chel's most brilliant star & self-exiled dissident, the honored Composer Ziller. Ziller claims he will do anything to avoid a meeting with Quilan, who he suspects has come to murder him. But the Major's true assignment will have far greater consequences than the death of a mere political dissident, as part of a conspiracy more ambitious than even he can know--a mission his superiors have buried so deeply in his mind that even he can't remember it.  Hailed by SFX magazine as ""an excellent hopping-on point if you've never read a Banks SF novel before,"" Look to Windward is an awe-inspiring immersion into the wildly original, vividly realized civilization Banks calls the Culture.";Better try not to mess with an almighty war AI, especially if you´re a primitive, status driven society.Reread 2022 with extended reviewSome of the topics are huge habitats controlled by a veteran AI and an, in comparison, primitive, archaic culture that plays around with hightech. Banks thereby criticizes caste systems, the process of deciding against or for war or cultural imperialism prime doctrine style, and the concepts of an afterlife that gets misused by ideology.  Brains for each special useThe discrepancy between an AI that should, on the one hand, protect all living beings in its sphere of influence and be as merciless as possible against attackers on the other hand. As if a high ranking killer general would have to build the best living for all the people under his command. Of course that´s totally possible, but the option of being governed by a super killing entity has a kind of overachieving protector taste. The AI gives one of the most badass superiority speeches ever too. The impact of artThe worth of art and its uniqueness and how art could be instrumentalized in the future as a tool for describing and criticizing complex topics are demonstrated by a renegade artist living in exile and sarcasting the heck out of his wacky, conservative culture. Castes and hierarchiesCriticizing these is one of Banks' big topics, giving loads of innuendos about everything that went and goes wrong in human societies. Especially economy and politics, money and ideology, are the maladies that postpone a post scarcity utopia and lead to things like Mind uploads for glory and homelandControlling a technology that could give immortality, but is instead misused to cement sick dictatorships that reduce the worth of humans to socioeconomic status and the family and caste they´re born into, is completely bonkers because of the unused potential of all these conscious beings. With optional use for war, deleting some billion souls to get some more free memory space, or pimp bandwidth. Giggle while being awestruckThat´s what Banks would have wanted, laugh about the great situations and dialogues satirizing this whole mess and recognize how far humankind still has to go. As always after finishing one of Banks' novels, the reader is left rueful, realizing how minuscule humankind is in relation to the undiscovered and barely understood, endless universe and the billions of years old and advanced civilizations that might be lurking, or hopefully friendly waiting, out there.

Under the Skin;Michel Faber;2000;2000;296;3.75;27083;no;['Fiction', 'Horror', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Scotland'];"Isserley picks up hitchhikers with big muscles. She, herself, is tiny—like a kid peering up over the steering wheel. She has a remarkable face and wears the thickest corrective lenses anyone has ever seen. Her posture is suggestive of some spinal problem. Her breasts are perfect; perhaps implants. She is strangely erotic yet somehow grotesque, vulnerable yet threatening. Her hitchhikers are a mixed bunch of men—trailer trash and travelling postgrads, thugs and philosophers. But Isserley is only interested in whether they have families and whether they have muscles. Then, it's only a question of how long she can endure her pain—physical and spiritual—and their conversation. Michel Faber's work has been described as a combination of Roald Dahl and Franz Kafka, as Somerset Maugham shacking up with Ian McEwan. At once humane and horrifying, Under the Skin takes us on a heart-thumping ride through dangerous territory—our own moral instincts and the boundaries of compassion.";I was supposed to write this review a month ago but life happened and the right moment did not seem to materialize. I wanted to write a detailed and spoilery analysis of the themes present but time passed and I don't feel capable to do it anymore. However, I feel obliged to write a few words.I will begin with the strong recommendation not to read any blurb before starting Under The Skin. The plot it is better to be explored without prior knowledge of the main mystery. Unfortunately, most blurbs and reviews include major spoilers. Please do not dismiss this novel because ir is described as Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy. There might be a touch of SF but the main ideas have nothing to do with space travel and the such. Also, although I agree that there are a few creepy and disturbing scenes, I would not classify it as horror either. At its core, Under the skin is a moral story and asks the question of what makes us human. It might be considered a books concerning animal activism but I don't think this was the objective. It is more of a discussion about identity, alienation, perception of humanity. Ultimately, the conclusion is that we are all the same under the skin.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123063.Under_the_Skin
The Swarm;Frank Schätzing;2004;2000;881;4.09;26157;no;['Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Fiction', 'German Literature', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery'];For more than two years, one book has taken over Germany's hardcover and paperback bestseller lists, reaching number one in Der Spiegel and setting off a frenzy in bookstores: The Swarm.Whales begin sinking ships. Toxic, eyeless crabs poison Long Island's water supply. The North Sea shelf collapses, killing thousands in Europe. Around the world, countries are beginning to feel the effects of the ocean's revenge as the seas and their inhabi-tants begin a violent revolution against mankind. In this riveting novel, full of twists, turns, and cliffhangers, a team of scientists discovers a strange, intelligent life force called the Yrr that takes form in marine animals, using them to wreak havoc on humanity for our ecological abuses. Soon a struggle between good and evil is in full swing, with both human and suboceanic forces battling for control of the waters. At stake is the survival of the Earth's fragile ecology -- and ultimately, the survival of the human race itself.The apocalyptic catastrophes of The Day After Tomorrow meet the watery menace of The Abyss in this gripping, scientifically realistic, and utterly imaginative thriller. With 1.5 million copies sold in Germany -- where it has been on the bestseller list without fail since its debut -- and the author's skillfully executed blend of compelling story, vivid characters, and eerie locales, Frank Schatzing's The Swarm will keep you in tense anticipation until the last suspenseful page is turned.(front flap);This is probably the only non-political book where I wanted to punch the author in the face after reading it. Possibly the most irritating book I have read since The Dark Tower. the book is fine for about 600 pages, then Frank loses it completely. First off, if after 600 pages you don't care whether a single character lives or dies, you know your in trouble. Secondly, if you are going to make the argument that everyone is just a mass of DNA and everything we do is the sole outcome of that DNA, why is every single American in this book practically evil? I don't have a problem with the portrayal as such, just that it doesn't jive with what he is putting forth about humanity. And Lastly, if the Yrr are so much better than humanity, so much more in tune with nature and basically benevolent, why are they using whales as projectiles? All of their offensives essentially involve that mass destruction of living creatures both human and non. That kind of hurts the case of them being benevolent avatars of mother nature or whatever he is trying to suggest. The chapter about the trip a particle takes through the oceans right in the middle of the books Climax was particularly galling. This may be the first any only time I invested this much time in a book to basically skim the ending. It is big and long so it would undoubtedly make excellent kindling.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68146.The_Swarm

Now, Bob is up to his neck in spycraft, parallel universes, dimension-hopping terrorists, monstrous elder gods and the end of the world. Only one thing is certain: it will take more than a full system reboot to sort this mess out ...;"so there's all sorts of nerds in the world, right? so many different kinds and really they don't have a lot in common outside of their basic nerdiness. I was out for drinks last Friday and someone made some kind of joke about renaming a lesbian club ""Aphrodite"" and I responded that that doesn't make sense, it should be called ""Artemis"" or at least ""Athena"", some goddess who isn't so connected to the male gaze and men in general etc. then I proceeded to describe what each of those goddesses oversees, their hallmarks, and their various equivalents across other mythologies. sadly, I soon noticed glazed looks and averted eyerolls from the guys & gals around the table. being quite familiar with those sorts of looks, I quickly apologized about going off into nerd-land so I could avoid an onslaught of mockery. I guess my apology must have been pleasing because they responded with a chorus of comments along the lines of ""Oh but we love our nerdy little mark"" or some such attempt to lift my nerd spirits. sigh. I really should find nerdier friends.the next day, thinking on that, I realized what kind of nerd I specifically am. I like the ancient world, and powers, and god-like beings, and strange cultures and forgotten civilizations. et cetera. magic and comics and mythology and that sort of stuff. I'm not a numbers or tech nerd and I'm definitely not a science nerd. I love science fiction, but I love it for its take on social and societal issues and I love it when it is all about the opera in space opera, rather than explaining in precise detail what ""space"" is.so The Atrocity Archives is definitely for nerds, but not this kind of nerd, not me, no way. every frickin' scientific theory or paranormal doodad is explained in intense detail over the course of long paragraphs punctuated by exclamation points that seem excited about things I barely understand and certainly don't care about. this book was a chore to read and I skimmed through so much technobabble. ugh, I hate when I skim through a book because that's like forcing myself to read. the one thing in its favor was that I was amused by the breezy, casual tone of the narrative and the narrator's voice - it reminded me of the very few urban fantasy novels I've read. but besides that, the book was a bore to me.this was a 1-star book for me but I'm not giving it that because it wasn't a bad book. I didn't like it but it's hard for me to blame the book for the two of us not being a good fit. I'm sure it's perfect for the right kind of nerd.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101869.The_Atrocity_Archives
Chasm City;Alastair Reynolds;2001;2000;694;4.13;25772;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Mystery', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];The once-utopian Chasm City—a doomed human settlement on an otherwise inhospitable planet—has been overrun by a virus known as the Melding Plague, capable of infecting any body, organic or computerized. Now, with the entire city corrupted—from the people to the very buildings they inhabit—only the most wretched sort of existence remains. For security operative Tanner Mirabel, it is the landscape of nightmares through which he searches for a low-life postmortal killer. But the stakes are raised when his search brings him face to face with a centuries-old atrocity that history would rather forget.;Get some illegal implants if you dare Welcome to the fabulous, mutated, degenerated, cyberpunk dystopian nightmare where the elite is celebrating with sick games while the base is rotting away, good old Roman decadence style. Want some cheap, illegal, operation as a welcome gift to make sure that you don´t grey/green goo too much and make the place even slimier and grittier?A fallen utopiaPossibly one of the darkest future city planning scenarios, it reminded me of China Mieville and shorter descriptions of decay and madness in other Sci-Fi works, but both the sheer range and the plot importance in the series and its other parts make it outstanding. Such an interesting place, partly dominated by steampunk and primitive trade and barter economy, some areas ruled by gangs of hybrids, and wait what is lurking in the abyss.Playing god is always funOh, the hybrids, often seen, but also used in a more positive way, but Reynolds goes full frontal pessimism and makes them  sad, abused creatures, first created for human use, just as meat and organ donor animals, becoming an own, independent fraction fueled by hate and thoughts of revenge . Brin did it more optimistic with dolphins and chimps, Hamilton had them at least with not enough conscience to make them feel bad about it, and strangely not many authors thought about complex backstories (to come in one of the next parts) and histories of human whatever hybrids or completely new creations and chimeras.Alien drugs are to die forAliens and drugs, a match made in psychedelic heaven or hell, depending on the standpoint, human or alien brain chemistry and how it reacts to the drug, addiction potential, and sense of responsibility, although if one deals with the devil, the devil doesn´t change, she/ he/it/ the hive mind changes you. Many plot options, the dealers being the humans or aliens, the influence on trade and politics, and, most important, it´s influence on the character´s personality, motivations, and abilities, thereby changing progress and payoff depending on the individual influence of the substance on setting and protagonists. And, most important, abuse, artificial scarcity, misuse, monopolization, and profiteering, basically the same as today in real life on bad, old earth, just with far cooler products. Future sects and cults may be even wackier than the nowaday standardsA complex second story deals with ideology and faith, inspiring to think about how future sects could develop their narrative, adding more Sci-Fi instead of old school hairy prophet stories with fantasy elements. What happens if believers go more sciency, of course just in their fairytales, not using the scientific method or doing research themselves or similar dangerous stuff, is a thought experiment of vast dimensions and, in this case, distances. Taking 1000 or 5000 years, one can easily imagine a colony or even a solar system where they teach kids that their holy woman (who knows?)/man was asteroid mining when an alien spaceship gave her/him a tip to go to an artifact where she/ he opened a wormhole to… I don´t see much real difference, although they may certainly cut the hard science part for better and easier understanding.Cool as heck, fast paced, and absolutely fascinatingAs always with Reynolds, the finetuning is immense, no more reading horsepower could be tickled out of this beast of a book, and all of the mentioned elements, the city, second story, drugs, and protagonist´s life, are perfectly interlinked and offer a perfect combination of quick cuts, Hollywood style dialogues and action sequences, cliffhangers, epic worldbuilding, and dry wit. Not so hard hard sci fi many will appreciateIt hasn´t as many hard science elements as in his other works, this is why I lower the too specific warning to a medium. We dive deeper into Reynolds´ world, although the main, meta, space opera story doesn´t really continue as a part of the Revelation Space series in this one and it´s more of an interlude. But that makes it perfectly readable for the ones who aren´t so much in the complexity and science of his other novels and like a good suspense, crime, thriller, whodunnit story. Oh, I forgot to mention that, he uses such a plot device with many flashbacks too.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89185.Chasm_City

That man was Darth Bane, a twisted genius whose iron will, fierce ambition, and strength in the dark side of the Force made him a natural leader among the Sith until his radical embrace of an all-but-forgotten wisdom drove him to destroy his own order . . . and create it anew from the ashes. As the last surviving Sith, Darth Bane promulgated a harsh new directive: the Rule of Two.Two there should be; no more, no less.One to embody the power, the other to crave it.Now Darth Bane is ready to put his policy into action, and he thinks he has found the key element that will make his triumph complete: a student to train in the ways of the dark side. Though she is young, Zannah possesses an instinctive link to the dark side that rivals his own. With his guidance, she will become essential in his quest to destroy the Jedi and dominate the galaxy.But there is one who is determined to stop Darth Bane: Johun Othone, Padawan to Jedi Master Lord Hoth, who died at Banes hands in the last great Sith War. Though the rest of the Jedi scoff at him, Joshuas belief that there are surviving Sith on the loose is unshakeable.As Johun continues his dogged pursuit of the man who killed his master, Zannah, faced unexpectedly with a figure from her past, begins to question her embrace of the dark side. And Darth Bane is led by Force-induced visions to a moon where he will acquire astonishing new knowledge and power, power that will alter him in ways he could never have imagined. . . .";This is a sequel to Path of Destruction: A Novel of the Old Republic (Star Wars: Darth Bane) it continues immediately after the first book and then jumps 10 years. The book follows Bane's apprentice from an innocent 10 year old to claim her own Darth title. Zannah can be even more cold blooded then her master. This book is enjoyable, and it is a credit to the author that he finished this book in 6 months. This book is the second step in the 1000 year plan that became Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (Star Wars (Random House Hardcover)). In the first book, Bane showed some humanity when he felt remorse and even crippling guilt over his first force murders, but Zannah does not seem to have a conscience at all. As a reader, I was drawn into Zannah's point of view. During the book, Bane makes himself nie-indestructible, which presents an interesting problem to his apprentice, who is destined to kill her master.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1347837.Rule_of_Two

Not only is the Ocisen Empire fleet fast approaching on a mission of genocide, but also an internecine war has broken out between the post-human factions over the destiny of humanity.Countering the various and increasingly desperate agents and factions is Paula Myo, a ruthlessly single-minded investigator, beset by foes from her distant past and colleagues of dubious allegiance...but she is fast losing a race against time.At the heart of all this is Edeard the Waterwalker, who once lived a long time ago deep inside the Void. He is the messiah of Living Dream, and visions of his life are shared by, and inspire billions of humans. It is his glorious, captivating story that is the driving force behind Living Dream's Pilgrimage, a force that is too strong to be thwarted. As Edeard nears his final victory the true nature of the Void is finally revealed.;"By linking 2 parallel, different universes, dimensions, realities; co dependent in potential mutually assured destruction, Hamilton unleashes an amazing plot dynamic. Dreams enabling a connection to parallel, or separated, or other, dimensions, are used as a central visionary element to accelerate the development towards typical reactions, depending on the technological and sociocultural stage of the population. And guess what, advanced tech doesn´t mean better brains, technological singularity comes many millennia before higher brain functions and logic dominate over instinct ridden, animalistic tribe behavior. There is a deep irony in the fact that the ever so sophisticated 4th millennia humans are still so prone to occult faith sect group think madnesses, no matter how ultimately destructive the consequences of their fringe enlightenment might be. Cool allegory, by the way, humans who could have everything to find a fulfilling life prefer endangering not just themselves, but many others, because their intuitive idiocy told them so. A list of physics and astrophysics tropes can, not just for experts who can visualize and imagine the forces while colorful numbers are popping up in their amazing brains, be a fascinating tool to define the laws and mechanisms of sci-fi series, establishing new senses of wonders, making suspension of disbelief easier, and finding completely new combinations of beloved genre archetypes. Hamilton does this a lot, while other authors are more focusing on the well known action plots, he takes underappreciated and never executed ideas and makes them big, driving forces of his ingenious masterpieces.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...This wise, just joking, advice is added to all reviews of Hamiltons´series.One of the most fascinating aspects of Hamilton´s future vision is to see the technology and society developing in very detail over long periods of time, making a return to his universe something always stunning and inspiring.

But their little colony has just received an unexpected an avenging angel with the power to lead mankind to safety -- or draw down its darkest enemy.And as she leads them to an apparently insignificant moon light-years away, it begins to dawn on Clavain and his companions that to beat one enemy, it may be necessary to forge an alliance with something much worse . . .""Absolution Gap is a good as it gets, and should solidify Alastair Reynolds' reputation as one of the best hard SF writers in the field."" -- SF Site";The final stages of an epic journey filled with goodies for fans, sci fa elements, a big WTF plot moment, more indoctrination virus and melding plague fun, and tons of goodies, innuendos, and connotations for fans of the series. Melding Plague, hyperpigs, inhibitors, and psi babiesThe melding plague infection moves towards its final stages, Scorpio gets an important role, the inhibitors are busy kind of gray gooing around and a science fantasy telepathy element gets big. All mixed together make it one of Reynolds easier to follow and consume works, purists and hardcore fans might even deem it too soft and easygoing for his standards.  Indoctrination virusNotice that this idea is big in Simmons epic Hyperion series too and how much potential it has. I´m not sure how often I´ve seen pure nano technical, biological psi, or mixed variants of it in both sci fi and fantasy, but its possibilities are sheer as endless as real life virus evolution. Depending on the technological level, ideology, and biology of a human or alien species, the mind, computer, nano, etc virus can be used for all good or bad, maybe even for medical applications instead of breeding the ultimate evil mind control brainwashing empire around a wacky, immortal god emperor. Even greater when one is a fan of the seriesIt could be read as first book of the series too, of course, especially because it´s as mentioned not so hardcore, but the biggest pleasure comes from getting the overkill of elements from the whole series, including the standalone books of the series. This outstanding interconnectedness over very long periods of in universe time must have taken Reynolds pretty much psi power and finetuning effort to get this whole thing rolling to a culmination even gigantic for a genre known for its huge scales. With its darkness, grim humor, and awakening a feeling for the vastness of space and time in comparison to the unimportance of humankind, Reynolds has created a unique universe and a new standard for all dark hard sci works of the future before they finally become reality.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89184.Absolution_Gap
The Algebraist;Iain M. Banks;2004;2000;434;4.03;22879;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];It is 4034. Humanity has made it to the stars. Fassin Taak, a Slow Seer at the Court of the Nasqueron Dwellers, will be fortunate if he makes it to the end of the year. The Nasqueron Dwellers inhabit a gas giant on the outskirts of the galaxy, in a system awaiting its wormhole connection to the rest of civilization. In the meantime, they are dismissed as decadents living in a state of highly developed barbarism, hoarding data without order, hunting their own young & fighting pointless formal wars. Seconded to a military-religious order he's barely heard of—part of the baroque hierarchy of the Mercatoria, the latest galactic hegemony— Taak has to travel again amongst the Dwellers. He is in search of a secret hidden for half a billion years. But with each day that passes a war draws closer—a war threatening to overwhelm everything & everyone he's ever known.;"The Dwellers are the Minds, just less friendly and even more advancedAn evil antagonist, the Dwellers, and The Mercatoria This one is different than the Culture novels, but uses the completely same trope mixture. An evil antagonist, mostly steampunky or technologically highly advanced but neo feudal torture nightmare state aka present reality in the Culture series, the Dwellers as the Minds and the Mercatoria as a spoiled and less advanced form of the Culture. The rest is business as usual, although it´s maybe even a bit funnier, because the typical Mind humor is now strange Dweller humor, who kind of care about nothing and tend to overreact or procrastinate.The devil in the machineThe dangers of AI and what the best long-time approach is one of the key elements of this novel and an everlasting hot topic that might lead to some interesting real-life events. Of course, in a perfect universe, benevolent AIs would help happily evolving humans and aliens, forever peacefully and symbiotic united. But if any of those parties might be evil it could get exponentially nasty and, let´s face it, nothing beats an AI.But without hell, there is no heat.But banning it after it nearly killed everyone damns the civilization to stagnation and loss of any technological progress in comparison to other aliens that use AI as a driving force of anything. Reducing the abilities of an AI to gain consciousness or to give it consciousness and incarcerate it in an escape-proof cyber prison, without cyborg bodies and networks to play with, may be an option, but it´s not able to remain competitive that way too.Techno primitivism or technocrazySo what to do with a pesky civilization that has chosen ""Kill all AIs."" as their mantra and logo when you are an AI or an alien race that wasn´t too stupid to integrate important preventive measures while developing AIs or still has some secret trigger hands in the background? Ignoring or preventing them from spreading might be the only options, because feeding those dull trolls by interacting with them might not be helpful.Billion years oldHow the longevity of a species might influence their view of the galaxy, intergalactic politics, social life and diplomacy is the second big topic. Million years of natural life with a childhood of a few hundred thousand years or something even closer to immortality may lead to apathy, arrogance, aggressive expansion, isolation, a god complex, etc., or even to something boring and positive outcomes. There is no real answer to this question and how a society deals with both godlike power and a never-ending life may be a question and mixture of culture, coincidence, and the motivation, technology, and mentality of the species they meet on their way to ultimate power.So now we´re gods and what´s next?Finally, there is the question of what stays important for a species that has reached everything. When the universe is understood, no borders exist and every endless life can be lived free, probably just philosophy, wisdom, and the interest in giving little pieces of it to other species to help them evolve may be interesting hobbies.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12009.The_Algebraist
The Android's Dream;John Scalzi;2006;2000;396;3.98;22692;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Humor', 'Fantasy', 'Aliens', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];A human diplomat kills his alien counterpart. Earth is on the verge of war with a vastly superior alien race. A lone man races against time and a host of enemies to find the one object that can save our planet and our people from alien enslavement...A sheep.That's right, a sheep. And if you think that's the most surprising thing about this book, wait until you read Chapter One. Welcome to The Android's Dream.For Harry Creek, it's quickly becoming a nightmare. All he wants is to do his uncomplicated mid-level diplomatic job with Earth's State Department. But his past training and skills get him tapped to save the planet--and to protect pet store owner Robin Baker, whose own past holds the key to the whereabouts of that lost sheep. Doing both will take him from lava-strewn battlefields to alien halls of power. All in a day's work. Maybe it's time for a raise.Throw in two-timing freelance mercenaries, political lobbyists with megalomaniac tendencies, aliens on a religious quest, and an artificial intelligence with unusual backstory, and you've got more than just your usual science fiction adventure story. You've got The Android's Dream.;I could have read The Ghost Brigades, could have read Fuzzy Nation, but if there is a book in the “to be read” stack whose title is an unmistakable Philip K. Dick reference, then this was clearly the right choice.And it was a good choiceLike a book by PKD, John Scalzi’s The Android’s Dream packs a lot to think about into an economically written, tightly wound package. From the genetically designed electric blue sheep, to a variety of alien races, to competing paranoid and invasive government agencies, featuring and aggrandizing a small business owner, to a complicating and weird religions Scalzi has done for Philip K. Dick what he did for Heinlein in Old Man's War – he has highlighted the best of the grandmaster and re-tooled the message for today’s audience.The Android’s Dream tells the unlikely but highly entertaining story of Harry Creek, an erstwhile, reluctant but capable hero who is not out to save the world – but he’s just the man to do just that. Harry meets up with Robin Baker, a charismatic, flirty pet shop owner with a mysterious past. Scalzi throws these two into an adventure that could have originated in a poverty stricken, paranoid rented house in northern California in the mid sixties.And like the very best of PKD, Scalzi casts as his protagonists the ordinary folks who display their greatness behind the scenes, while quietly saving us all in understated Ghostbusters fashion. Dick’s greatest heroes are rarely the power elite, more often the small-time, unnoticed everyman whose character provides the framework and foundation of a greater society.If you like Scalzi’s work, if you are a fan of Philip K. Dick, if you like a quirky but fun modern science fiction work that does not take itself too seriously, The Android’s Dream is a good read.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7081.The_Android_s_Dream
The Evolutionary Void;Peter F. Hamilton;2009;2000;694;4.28;22412;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Adventure'];Exposed as the Second Dreamer, Araminta has become the target of a galaxywide search by government agent Paula Myo and the psychopath known as the Cat, along with others equally determined to prevent-- or facilitate --the pilgrimage of the Living Dream cult into the heart of the Void. An indestructible microuniverse, the Void may contain paradise, as the cultists believe, but it is also a deadly threat. For the miraculous reality that exists inside its boundaries demands energy--energy drawn from everything outside those boundaries: from planets, stars, galaxies... from everything that lives. Meanwhile, the parallel story of Edeard, the Waterwalker -- as told through a series of addictive dreams communicated to the gaiasphere via Inigo, the First Dreamer -- continues to unfold. But now the inspirational tale of this idealistic young man takes a darker and more troubling turn as he finds himself faced with powerful new enemies -- and temptations more powerful still. With time running out, a repentant Inigo must decide whether to release Edeard's final dream: a dream whose message is scarcely less dangerous than the pilgrimage promises to be. And Araminta must choose whether to run from her unwanted responsibilities or face them down, with no guarantee of success or survival. But all these choices may be for naught if the monomaniacal Ilanthe, leader of the breakaway Accelerator Faction, is able to enter the Void. For it is not paradise she seeks there, but dominion.;"Better be careful in choosing what to think about, because one´s dream could become other people´s dimension crushing reality.Reminds me of the Zones of ThoughtVernor Vinge used a similar idea of switching between science and fantasy, letting the 2 collide, and battle it out in the readers´ minds between a little magic and big science, in the first Zones of Thought novel. Of course not as complex, bombastic, and cinematic as Hamilton does, close to nobody can, but the idea was there and Hamilton used it to accelerate towards a grand escalation in the third, final part of the series.Even big at fantasyThat he is also that big at writing fantasy amazed me, because jumping between genres is not the usual hold my beer, in between activity, but his letting characters tell the story and using their abilities and interests as main plot vehicles narrative style works in fantastic worlds too. Parallels shouldn´t collide in conventional physicsWatch in awe how the consequences in both parallel, co dependent universes have to worsen the situation for reasons of survival, how physics forces different humankinds to once fight for a really good reason, for not letting the dirty, expansionistic reality eat away ones´ universe. Although this could make natural science the big factor in the game, because whoever would find an easy, realistic solution for the physical quarrel reasons, should really get the Nobel prize and at least the patents for the technology as a reward. Wouldn´t that motivate kids to become scientists, not just to be curious, altruistic, and brave, but famous and rich too?Could have many different manifestationsThe series is also showing the potential of science fantasy on many different levels. Beginning with the worldbuilding, society, culture, tradition, faith, and how science is done; over to how the fractions find out that there is something beyond their sphere of influence and unattainable behind a barrier of physics, reality, and time; and how finally the protagonists´ abilities can be explained with scientific, fantastic, or mixed anomalies, making them masters of the physical ones, and used as fascinating story development options.Throwing so many aspects in the mix as Hamilton did over the time of this series, in this case, dreams, far future tech humans, primitive fantasy humans, multiverses, or different universes, indirectly implying the option of time travel if there would be copies of universes with the same, cloned or multiplied, population in different time zones, consciousnesses, etc., opens up the possibility that one of the thousands of sci fis´ reality explaining attempts could be the real deal. That it´s already shown and researched how it works, but we still don´t know or never will for sure.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...This wise, just joking, advice is added to all reviews of Hamiltons´series.One of the most fascinating aspects of Hamilton´s future vision is to see the technology and society developing in very detail over long periods of time, making a return to his universe something always stunning and inspiring.

The 2-D villains (the evil empire and doubters in the fleet... basically everyone not on team Geary) started to get annoying, as did the simplistic analysis of military doctrine (tactics=good, flying your spaceship into your enemies death-ray=bad) which was especially disappointing as I had actually enjoyed it in the previous book. On the Brightside Geary's attempts to maintain morale in the fleet were written with surprising deftness and the battle scenes were still cool. I'll continue on with this series as it's light and pretty enjoyable and also in the hope that the military strategy and villains will be fleshed out more in the future.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96594.Fearless
Agent to the Stars;John Scalzi;2004;2000;286;3.92;22328;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Aliens', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];The space-faring Yherajk have come to Earth to meet us and to begin humanity's first interstellar friendship. There's just one problem: They're hideously ugly and they smell like rotting fish. So getting humanity's trust is a challenge. The Yherajk need someone who can help them close the deal. Enter Thomas Stein, who knows something about closing deals. He's one of Hollywood's hottest young agents. But although Stein may have just concluded the biggest deal of his career, it's quite another thing to negotiate for an entire alien race. To earn his percentage this time, he's going to need all the smarts, skills, and wits he can muster.;For a first work, this is both so weird and hilariously funny at the same time that I am absolutely not sure what to think about it. It´s as if it was Scalzi´s intent to write some crappy elements in this one, because he usually doesn´t do this, I don´t know, intending to write less pro. Ok, it was his first novel, subjectively I am pretty sure that this is a bit of an experiment and not meant really seriously, just a kind of test balloon to see how his writing might be accepted by the audience, just as redshirts, not really meant to be a serious, more of a just joking, novel, more a satire of the themes included, not really interested in telling an own story. That´s especially interesting, because he published Old Man´s War the same year, so he definitively knew how to write bombastic, comedic sci-fi that satirizes the genre itself, but just wanted to do something else too. A kind of slapstick comedy writing exercise with some sci-fi trope mixed in. I, subjectively, don´t think that there is much ironic depth hidden here, maybe a bit of superficial Hollywood criticism behind all the fart jokes, but nothing really substantial. But I couldn´t point my finger at any of his other works, or another sci-fi authors´ books, who used alien physiology in such a hilarious fashion to create easy, stinking entertainment.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88072.Agent_to_the_Stars
Infected;Scott Sigler;2008;2000;342;3.83;21921;yes;['Horror', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Zombies', 'Aliens'];Across America a mysterious disease is turning ordinary people into raving, paranoid murderers who inflict brutal horrors on strangers, themselves, and even their own families. Working under the government’s shroud of secrecy, CIA operative Dew Phillips crisscrosses the country trying in vain to capture a live victim. With only decomposing corpses for clues, CDC epidemiologist Margaret Montoya races to analyze the science behind this deadly contagion. She discovers that these killers all have one thing in common – they’ve been contaminated by a bioengineered parasite, shaped by a complexity far beyond the limits of known science.Meanwhile Perry Dawsey – a hulking former football star now resigned to life as a cubicle-bound desk jockey – awakens one morning to find several mysterious welts growing on his body. Soon Perry finds himself acting and thinking strangely, hearing voices . . . he is infected.  The fate of the human race may well depend on the bloody war Perry must wage with his own body, because the parasites want something from him, something that goes beyond mere murder.;Time to break free from these nasty monster parasites, no matter how entertaining their escalating body horror and mutilation action is for the reader. Bloody technobabbleScience mixed with disgusting terror in a way I haven´t seen before, Sigler is giving a completely fresh and educating look on the tiny aspects of possible biological hazards, alien germ, and infectious tropes. Mostly, in resident evil walking dead style horror genre novels, the people dealing with these problems, especially the annoying hypochondriacs, aren´t the protagonists, but cannon fodder, while the real, clean, and healthy protagonists are cliffhanging around. How discriminating.Redshirts can live, and suffer immensely, tooBut not here, the forgotten, rarely thought, and well executed idea of making the researchers and the victims the main focus of the story, instead of the boring, stereotypical action heroes, opens 2 different, fascinating narrative perspectives.Why is this happening to me?The research part is also often highly underrepresented, because it includes hard-sci fi elements, thereby stigmatizing and branding itself as potentially boring, not suspenseful enough for most of the audience who wants her/his average protagonist personal and ideological development mixed with some action soup, except for the ones who are into it too. Thereby it would open up so many complex, fascinating plot options that go beyond the known informing the hero about the newest, creepy research, such as implying micro and meta developments, educating, integrating ideology, philosophy of science, etc.I don´t like how it manifestsThe disgusting perspective is, subjectively, even more fascinating, because people love terrible mutations in combination with mind control, losing personality, and generally having a bad week, as long as they don´t suffer themselves, and the introspections of people infected with maladies with potentially endless combinations of physical and psychological effects are interesting to see and, especially, guess, what that wacky virus might do next. This could be expanded to not just one or some infected humans, but to groups, states, and planets secretly or openly ruled by king parasite.Future will show how much will become realThere is more reality than one might want to think about in this one too, because we still know nothing about the impact of brain parasites, fungi, prions, viruses, etc. on any stage of human evolution from first microbiology to tiny mammals and rodents to simian evolution and early humans, just as with food, biochemistry, why drugs work, etc. Who infected us and ran haywire while we ate what are 2 of the biggest open questions in brainy brains history to think about before it rots, mutates, or gets assimilated.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2331954.Infected

Molecular nanotechnology runs rampant, replicating and reprogramming at will. Contact with extraterrestrial life grows more imminent with each new day.Struggling to survive and thrive in this accelerated world are three generations of the Macx clan: Manfred, an entrepreneur dealing in intelligence amplification technology whose mind is divided between his physical environment and the Internet; his daughter, Amber, on the run from her domineering mother, seeking her fortune in the outer system as an indentured astronaut; and Sirhan, Amber's son, who finds his destiny linked to the fate of all of humanity.For something is systemically dismantling the nine planets of the solar system. Something beyond human comprehension. Something that has no use for biological life in any form.";"OK, let's start with the fact that the book jacket compared Charles Stross's writing with William Gibson and Neal Stephenson at their best.As a reader who has a serious crush on Stephenson's writing, I instantly had an expectation was set up in my mind, as you can imagine.However, this novel was thoroughly disappointing. I like hard SF and cyberpunk that explores social mores and the impacts of technology and science upon society. And can do so with humor (or irony). The science was so outlandishly bad (e.g. generating sufficient power to run manufacturing plants on a satellite of Jupiter by wrapping conductors around the satellite, across the poles, to create a conducting loop to move through Jupiter's magnetic field), and the belief in the Singularity so without skepticism, that I stopped drinking the Kool-Aid at about page 220, and had to gut out the last half of the book without the necessary suspension of disbelief that is why I read science fiction in the first place. As the book proceeds use of science or IT concepts becomes increasingly absurd as the main characters (who are nearly impossible to feel any sympathy for) are rescued, Deus ex Machina style, from ridiculous crises with unexplored implications that abuse the reader's time and effort placed in attempting to understand what has been written.The ability to dash out clever metaphors and create a story around a compelling idea (like the Singularity) does not guarantee that the story will be good. Stross has moments of true humor and irony, but the characters are leaden and locked in epoch-long neuroses that persist whether the character is in ""meatspace"" or has re-instantiated itself as an orangutan or a flock of passenger pigeons (I'm not making this up). There is also a level of omniscience and confidence in the main characters that suggests they know everything that has happened and will happen. While this may be a device to make the post-humans off-putting to us as human beings, part of the reason to write a book is to get humans to read it, and most real humans won't soldier through a book with know-it-all characters they cannot care about, who already have figured out everything that will happen to them, and seem unbelievably bored by anything except for their family squabbles. The middle third (from around page 200 through 300) really lacks coherence and cannot be readily followed by any but the most careful reading. And, upon careful reading, you are not rewarded. This is not Pynchon or Faulkner; this is geek speak that does not connect with ideas that matter. At the point where the travellers encounter alien intelligences, the entire story completely falls apart and has to be rescued, again, from its own excesses.I have spent too much time writing about this. If you read this review, you have been warned about what to expect in reading this book. I will not be picking up another Stross novel any time soon.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17863.Accelerando

On Coruscant, the Senate watches anxiously as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine aggressively strips away more and more constitutional liberties in the name of safeguarding the Republic. Yoda, Mace Windu, and their fellow Masters grapple with the Chancellor’ s disturbing move to assume control of the Jedi Council. And Anakin Skywalker, the prophesied Chosen One, destined to bring balance to the Force, is increasingly consumed by his fear that his secret love, Senator Padmé Amidala, will die.As the combat escalates across the galaxy, the stage is set for an explosive endgame: Obi-Wan undertakes a perilous mission to destroy the dreaded Separatist military leader General Grievous. Palpatine, eager to secure even greater control, subtly influences public opinion to turn against the Jedi. And a conflicted Anakin–tormented by unspeakable visions– edges dangerously closer to the brink of a galaxy-shaping decision. It remains only for Darth Sidious, whose shadow looms ever larger, to strike the final staggering blow against the Republic . . . and to ordain a fearsome new Sith Lord: Darth Vader.Based on the screenplay of the eagerly anticipated final film in George Lucas’s epic saga, bestselling Star Wars author Matthew Stover’s novel crackles with action, captures the iconic characters in all their complexity, and brings a space opera masterpiece full circle in stunning style.;"Lord Vader… rise!
Once again, fellow readers in the Force, if you have been reading my reviews about Star Wars film novelizations, you already know that I’ll do several spoilers in this review (which is quite the opposite to my regular kind of reviews, but with Star Wars movie novelizations is quite hard not to fall into spoilers in the reviews while I am writing them. Don’t say I didn’t warn you!
YOUNGLINGS
Revenge of the Sith is the darkest moment of Star Wars movies, since it’s when Anakin Skywalker finally meets his fate in the balance of the Force.It’s kinda funny that good ol’ Georgie thought that using the word “younglings” would make a milder impact on people instead of saying plainly “kids” or “children”, when Anakin does the unspeakble act againts the youngest students in the Jedi Temple. Also, I think that The Force is quite permissive, about who enters into it,......since in Episode VI, you can watch Anakin as a ghost along with his pals, so it seems that you can massacre entire Tusken Raiders’ town (men, women and children) and killing “younglings” at the Jedi Temple, for not saying all the Jedi that he must kill at the following Jedi purge, etc… and still you can become one with the Force……yes, he repented from his sins before Luke, but hey, he did A LOT of VERY BAD things, so The Force should have some kind of purgatory I think, since it seems that got away with you evil deeds in life is kinda too easy and you still becoming one with The Force.
SO WHAT’S DIFFERENT HERE ANYWAY?
Movie versus book, you can find here……that Palpatine reveals himself openly to the readers since the beginning of the book, instead that the movies, that if you hadn’t read the expanded universe old novels, it wasn’t clear that Darth Sidious and Chancellor Palpatine were one and the same. Moreover, during the novel, Palpatine goes into deeper details of his master plan to defeat the Jedi Order.…Dooku was fooled thinking that he will be part of a ruling triumvirate along with Anakin and Palpatine, and oddly, Dooku isn’t that powerful in comparison to Anakin, since in canonical novels and animated TV episodes, it was evident that no alone Jedi could be able to beat Dooku in a duel.…also quite ood, General Grievious didn’t have the cough, result after his battle against Mace Windu.…but the prize to the oddest in the book is that all scenes in Kashyyyk (the Wookie homeworld) aren’t developed!!!…while you can feel it something about it in the movie, on the book it’s quite clear that Anakin is jealous of Obi-Wan and fearing that his master would be having a secret affair with Padme.…the Jedis that go with Mace Windu to arrest Palpatine, do a kinda better battle, instead than in the movie were they’re beaten too easily.…on the book is quite disturbing to read how much Anakin enjoys to kill Separatist Leaders once he turned to the Dark Side.…you have clear access to the thoughts of Darth Vader once inside the protective armor, in his bitter process of truly becoming someone totally different than Anakin.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35458.Star_Wars

Born in Cuba, he speaks fluent Russian, lives in one room in a NoLita warehouse, and does delicate jobs involving information transfer. Hollis Henry is an investigative journalist, on assignment from a magazine called Node. Node doesn't exist yet, which is fine; she's used to that. But it seems to be actively blocking the kind of buzz that magazines normally cultivate before they start up. Really actively blocking it. It's odd, even a little scary, if Hollis lets herself think about it much. Which she doesn't; she can't afford to. Milgrim is a junkie. A high-end junkie, hooked on prescription antianxiety drugs. Milgrim figures he wouldn't survive twenty-four hours if Brown, the mystery man who saved him from a misunderstanding with his dealer, ever stopped supplying those little bubble packs. What exactly Brown is up to Milgrim can't say, but it seems to be military in nature. At least, Milgrim's very nuanced Russian would seem to be a big part of it, as would breaking into locked rooms. Bobby Chombo is a ""producer"", and an enigma. In his day job, Bobby is a troubleshooter for manufacturers of military navigation equipment. He refuses to sleep in the same place twice. He meets no one. Hollis Henry has been told to find him.";"William Gibson’s Blue Ant series theme seems to be the post Cold War / post 9.11 world where governments, government agencies, intelligence groups and powerful global entities have made paradigm shifts in their focus and world view.Blue Ant is a global marketing agency led by Belgian Hubertus Bigend and operated out of London. Bigend sees modern advertising as “reverse espionage” and finds that his special projects involving post-cyberpunk underground investigations akin to an organisms need for sleep and dreams.In Spook Country, Gibson’s 2007 publication and (sort of) sequel to his novel Pattern Recognition (2003) and followed by Zero History in 2010 – we find Bigend engaging the services of Hollis Henry, a former world celebrity cutting her teeth in journalism but never completely leaving behind her status as a famed rock star. Hollis encounters visual and virtual artists and other locative technology specialists in her investigation that leads her to underground engagements.Gibson’s narrative follows Hollis but she shares time with two other plotlines: one with a hostage translator kept by a former special forces thug and the third storyline with a group led by a former CIA agent and focusing on a Cuban-Chinese family of special operatives.Like Pattern Recognition, Gibson wastes little time with lengthy foundations and intricately explained characterizations. The pace is fast and with little clues as to what’s happening; so the reader gets only a brisk introduction and really figures things out towards the middle of the book. Gibson is too good a writer to lose his audience though, as the language is sophisticated and engaging.Readers may be put off by the trifecta of protagonists, but Gibson expertly weaves the three loosely connected storylines together and his fiction has the look and feel of a corporate espionage over watch, which is really where Bigend seems to fit in; almost as a smooth European Charley to the action setting Angels.Gibson’s earlier cyberpunk incantations are revisited here through his exposition of locative art and, like his post/Cold War and post 9/11 themes, this element of Spook Country seems to again declare Gibson’s role as a chronicler of the here and now, an in depth current historian with his finger on the pulse of the world culture as it is perhaps in only the very near future.Is this science fiction? The setting is the current time, perhaps a step ahead, but Gibson’s attention in Spook Country is more on the speculative fiction of the Now rather than future world building.Urbane and thrilling with a cool delivery, Gibson has crafted another very readable page-turner.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22322.Spook_Country

A bit too much character focus that escalates toward drivel I wonder how this could have happened to Reynolds, because he usually tends to fully focus on worldbuilding or future humans´ modifications and its effects on their psychology, ideology, and, duh, physiology cyborging full throttle, but here he escalates towards redundancy. That´s especially annoying because it´s not connected to aliens or the mentioned body upgrades, but based on a friendship vs rivalry constellation around a basic plot decision that keeps being a problem throughout the whole novel. The most annoying thing is that  Different alien and future human fractionspop up so late in the story and make it a real space opera that one seriously asks why it couldn´t have lifted off much, much earlier. Don´t get me wrong, there are still fascinating ideas about cryogenics, Clarketech, time travel paradoxes, alien cultures, etc., but I´ve read most of Reynolds´works twice and know that he can do so much bigger, better, and more complex. He kind of wasted a perfect plot for the sake of character focus as if he wanted to try out some social studies in space instead of doing what he is famous for, hard sci fying with fascinating meta concepts. If another author would have done this from his first work on, I absolutely wouldn´t have a problem with this social sci fi attitude, but Reynolds´just didn´t deliver the usual dessert, making this work the definitively not brightest candle on his hard sci fi space opera chimera cake. Micro future human societyThe very long timeline combines the problems of resource scarcity, best use of an alien artifact, and the mentioned über focus on protagonists to one more idea of how  aliens might like to do their research . If there are artifacts, superstructures, and relicts out there, is their origin based on the extinction of the aliens that built them, a kind of cosmic Chuck Norrising to show everyone what they got both for prestige and deterrence, bait to attract alien civilizations to put them in a cosmic zoo or laboratory, or just a hobby for everyday, multidimensional, immortal, almighty, and thereby bored, godlike aliens?Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89186.Pushing_Ice

But it has hardly ever been exemplified in such a disturbing, freaky way as in this part because no normal, not enhanced human could go through such psychological and physical stress without going completely bonkers.Self referencing as heck Please read the series in order, because without that, all the innuendos and connotations get lost. Reynolds is playing with anticipated events of other parts of the series in other timelines, showing other aspects of the fractions, power balances, governments, systems in a different state of technical and sociocultural evolution, and generally expands the Revelation Space universe. And why couldn´t he continue it, why, it´s one of the best sci-fi universes ever created, what a world do we live in where such a groundbreaking milestone of the genre can´t…Excuse the breakdown, I did also just notice that he continues it, so, false alarm, jay!Not one AI, 2 of themAnd how they show humanity who is boss which leads to an interesting conclusion and forever war that should irritate everyone using networks.

Many shy away from the heavy load of the hard sci-fi overkill, but miss many of the best parts of it that way that just can´t be shown as stylish in other subgenres or outside the genre itself.

There would be even a third way, the often underrepresented biopunk option, that could see much more use in hybrid works, because already simple seemingly fantasy magic vs technology, especially nano, makes incredible plot goals, characters´ motivations, suspense potential, possible, and biotechnological fueled Gaia fraction would be great extra to see.I wish Simmons would have continued writing big science fantasy series, maybe even with a bit of horror, instead of starting to just keep writing standalone novels, often with close to no real fantastic elements as far as I see from the reviews and descriptions, just some magic and stuff. The real irony is that most of his newer novels seem to be even that bad that I won´t ever read them and that readers first confronted with whatever happened to one of the greatest authors will never touch his groundbreaking Hyperion and Ilium series, which is a true shame.Nobody knows what might have happened here, I don´t know examples of authors who downed their rating in such a way, especially not in that order and timeline and never when they´ve once been so good. Bad first works are ok, everybody has to learn, but getting weaker and seemingly even below average?! Maybe the lonely writing in the cabin in the woods in the mountains concept has had some substantial change or something, I really can´t grasp it.

Originally in paperback.;"""Your Grace,"" she said, ""I have only one question. Do you wish this man crippled, or dead?""This may be the best so far of Weber's Honor Harrington space buckle-and-swash series. Exiled in disgrace, Honor takes up her post as Steadholder of Grayson, but a Woman In Charge is a very new thing on her adopted planet and not everyone thinks her presence there is a good idea. The covert battle between new and old culminates in a face-off between Honor and the bad guy with big-ass swords. And then she has to go out and save Grayson from an invading space navy. Again. Great stuff.The thing I like most about these novels is that Honor is no cardboard character. She has hopes and fears and doubts, she screws up, but never has there been a character that better represents the definition of a good commanding officer. The best thing about her is she doesn't buy into everyone else's opinion of her--if she were a hero, she thinks, then she should have been able not only to win the battle, but to have saved all of her crewmen who died in that battle. But then she'd be Wonder Woman, and she knows that, too.The thing I like least about these novels is the interminable explanations of the various political scenes in the various empires, and the equally interminable explanations of future tech. The good news is they usually come in indigestible chunks that are easily skipped over so you can get back to Honor and the plot.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77738.Flag_in_Exile

Badly damaged and low on supplies, the Alliance Fleet is raiding Syndic mines for raw materials-and Captain ""Black Jack"" Geary hopes they can continue to remain one step ahead of their enemies. But the Syndics are the least of Geary's worries when he learns of the existence of aliens with the power to annihilate the human race.";"LOOKING FOR INTELLIGENT, WELL WRITTEN, MILITARY SF?....Congraties to you maties because here it is... 

3.5 stars. I read a lot of different genres and sub-genres and not all of them are in my “sweet spot” so sometimes my ratings can be a little lower on books than I think they deserve. This is a case in point. I believe that fans of military SF will likely rate this between 4 and 5 stars and deservedly so as it is definitely a high quality effort. The Lost Fleet series, of which this is the third installment, is very well written, intelligently plotted and among the best examples of the sub-genre that I have come across. 

John “Black Jack” Geary is an excellent character and one of the truly well-drawn GOOD GUYS of popular fiction. In my opinion, too often “white hats” are portrayed as one dimensional or over the top heroic...and frankly that gets more irritating than URKEL spouting catch phrases in his suspenders...

...YES...YES, you did that you annoying douchetard now please leave us alone... Anyway, Geary is anything but one dimensional and it is his growth as a character and his engaging presence that allows even the slower parts of the narrative (at least from my non military-SF-loving perspective) to be interesting. His character alone is worth checking out the series and is probably the number one reason while I will continue on with the series.For those of you not familiar with the series, Geary, a legendary captain awoken after 100 years in hyper sleep, finds himself in command of a battle fleet cut off and deep in the heart of enemy territory (that enemy being that vastly larger empire known as the Syndicate). During Geary’s 100 year absence, the protracted war has caused a sever degradation in military tradition, skill and honor in the participants and atrocities have been committed on both sides. Thus, in addition to fighting his way home, Geary also finds himself fighting to instill a sense of honor in the fleet while trying to downplay his own larger than life reputation (which he does not believe he deserves). According to the author, the series is inspired by the journey of the Ten Thousand as told by the ancient Greek historian Xenophon in The Anabasis. Part of the charm of the series is the authenticity of the plotting, the battles and the attention to detail regarding the military engagements. Given the vast distances involved, communication and real time information are incredibly difficult to coordinate and Jack Campbell does a terrific job in making his story feel right. Unfortunately, this is the same aspect of the book that keeps me from giving it 4 stars. It is terrific for what it is but is not interesting enough for me to keep me engrossed in the narrative. I would prefer more politics and intrigue than tactics and strategy. I just say this so that you can take my rating for what it is worth. Overall, a good book and I liked it. Certainly recommended for fans of military SF.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1372055.Courageous

The world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned poet. Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger, and he’s starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts. Living with his son’s family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice. But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only if, like his thirteen-year-old granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless access—through nodes designed into smart clothes—and to see the digital context—through smart contact lenses.  With knowledge comes risk. When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination.  In a world where every computer chip has Homeland Security built-in, this conspiracy is something that baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts, including Robert’s son and daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military. And even Miri, in her attempts to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the plot.  As Robert becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked to learn of a radical change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books there, and worldwide, would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees feel compelled to join protests against the change. With forces around the world converging on San Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular moment as unique and satisfying as it is unexpected.";"Christmas 2010: I realised that I had got stuck in a rut.

. I really did try to like it. I thought for the first half of the book that I might just actually end up liking it. But I didn’t. What frustrates me most about 

Rainbows End

 is that I’m not even certain why we didn’t gel.The world building is top-notch – plausible and convincing, thoroughly detailed, interesting and original, memorable, etc – all qualities I normally laud.I know it can’t be just because the protagonist is a grating grouch. I’ll admit that I spent most my read hoping he’d fall down an open manhole, but I’ve enjoyed other books with even less likeable leads (Donaldson - 
Thomas Covenant
?).And it’s not that the protagonist was old – I’m not ageist – I love a good silver-haired sleuth! (King - 
Insomnia
?)Could it be that the plot sort of fizzled and drifted into a faux-thriller mystery with a bunny? Maybe.Or that the supporting cast are utterly forgettable? Perhaps.Was it because the story lacks anything close to a true emotional hook? Could be.None of these factors on their own would be enough to put me off a book, but all of them together stopped me from enjoying the wonderful ideas that kicked this book off. The only reason I can’t outright 1-star the book is that I’m not sure it’s entirely

’s fault. Have you ever had that feeling, when you take an instant dislike to somebody? It’s out of character and you’re probably just having a bad day, but you can’t shake your first impression that this guy is a thoroughbred douche? And you feel bad for being so judgemental, so you end-up being nicer to this douche than you probably should be? Yeah. This is like that.I think my favorite idea here (and it's one that completely irrelevant to the plot) is the notion of fiction inspired augmented reality overlays of real locations.

Based directly on Frank Herbert's final outline, which lay hidden in a safe-deposit box for a decade, these two volumes will finally answer the urgent questions Dune fans have been debating for two decades.At the end of Chapterhouse: Dune-- Frank Herbert's final novel--a ship carrying the ghola of Duncan Idaho, Sheeana (a young woman who can control sandworms), and a crew of various refugees escapes into the uncharted galaxy, fleeing from the monstrous Honored Matres, dark counterparts to the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. The nearly invincible Honored Matres have swarmed into the known universe, driven from their home by a terrifying, mysterious Enemy. As designed by the creative genius of Frank Herbert, the primary story of Hunters and Sandworms is the exotic odyssey of Duncan's no-ship as it is forced to elude the diabolical traps set by the ferocious, unknown Enemy. To strengthen their forces, the fugitives have used genetic technology from Scytale, the last Tleilaxu Master, to revive key figures from Dune's past--including Paul Muad'Dib and his beloved Chani, Lady Jessica, Stilgar, Thufir Hawat, and even Dr. Wellington Yueh. Each of these characters will use their special talents to meet the challenges thrown at them.Failure is unthinkable--not only is their survival at stake, but they hold the fate of the entire human race in their hands.;"I hope I live a very long time, but I know that someday, like all human beings, I must die.

Anderson bring us the magnificent final chapter in the unforgettable saga begun in Dune: House Atreides and continued in Dune: House Harkonnen.Here nobles and commoners, soldiers and slaves, wives and courtesans shape the amazing destiny of a tumultuous universe. An epic saga of love and war, crime and politics, religion and revolution, this magnificent novel is a fitting conclusion to a great science fiction trilogy ... and an invaluable addition to the thrilling world of Frank Herbert's immortal Dune.Dune: House CorrinoFearful of losing his precarious hold on the Golden Lion Throne, Shaddam IV, Emperor of a Million Worlds, has devised a radical scheme to develop an alternative to melange, the addictive spice that binds the Imperium together and that can be found only on the desert world of Dune.In subterranean labs on the machine planet Ix, cruel Tleilaxu overlords use slaves and prisoners as part of a horrific plan to manufacture a synthetic form of melange known as amal. If amal can supplant the spice from Dune, it will give Shaddam what he seeks: absolute power.But Duke Leto Atreides, grief-stricken yet unbowed by the tragic death of his son Victor, determined to restore the honor and prestige of his House, has his own plans for Ix.He will free the Ixians from their oppressive conquerors and restore his friend Prince Rhombur, injured scion of the disgraced House Vernius, to his rightful place as Ixian ruler. It is a bold and risky venture, for House Atreides has limited military resources and many ruthless enemies, including the sadistic Baron Harkonnen, despotic master of Dune.Meanwhile, Duke Leto's consort, the beautiful Lady Jessica, obeying the orders of her superiors in the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, has conceived a child that the Sisterhood intends to be the penultimate step in the creation of an all-powerful being. Yet what the Sisterhood doesn't know is that the child Jessica is carrying is not the girl they are expecting, but a boy.Jessica's act of disobedience is an act of love -- her attempt to provide her Duke with a male heir to House Atreides -- but an act that, when discovered, could kill both mother and baby.Like the Bene Gesserit, Shaddam Corrino is also concerned with making a plan for the future -- securing his legacy. Blinded by his need for power, the Emperor will launch a plot against Dune, the only natural source of true spice. If he succeeds, his madness will result in a cataclysmic tragedy not even he foresees: the end of space travel, the Imperium, and civilization itself.With Duke Leto and other renegades and revolutionaries fighting to stem the tide of darkness that threatens to engulf their universe, the stage is set for a showdown unlike any seen before.;Buddy read with Athena!Though grand events could take place in the politics of the Imperium, the desert itself never changed.That sentence beautifully summarises this whole series. The houses are fighting wars in the shadows. Assassins are striking unknowing targets. Planets are being bombarded. People are born, and people die. But Arrakis… Dune… the desert… never changes.House Corrino is a great conclusion to a great prequel trilogy. I had not expected this kind of enjoyment at the start of the first book, but in the end this proved to be a brilliant expansion of one of the most fascinating science fiction universes ever created. Though easier to read than the original novels, these prequels are filled to the brim with political intrigue, fighting and general suspense.Certain events were also quite surprising. A surprising character death, for instance, is not something you expect to find in a prequel. There were also hints to storylines beginning far later in the main series, thus making it even more important that readers considering this series read it in order of publication.So far, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson seem to have done a great job of carrying on the legacy of the brilliant Frank Herbert. And there is a lot more yet to come…;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20252.House_Corrino

Diplomatic Immunity;Lois McMaster Bujold;2002;2000;367;4.19;16653;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy'];A rich Komarran merchant fleet has been impounded at Graf Station, in distant Quaddiespace, after a bloody incident on the station docks involving a security officer from the convoy's Barrayaran military escort. Lord Miles Vorkosigan of Barrayar and his wife, Lady Ekaterin, have other things on their minds, such as getting home in time to attend the long-awaited births of their first children. But when duty calls in the voice of Barrayar's Emperor Gregor, Miles, Gregor's youngest Imperial Auditor (a special high-level troubleshooter) has no choice but to answer.Waiting on Graf Station are diplomatic snarls, tangled loyalties, old friends, new enemies, racial tensions, lies and deceptions, mysterious disappearances, and a lethal secret with wider consequences than even Miles anticipates: a race with time for life against death in horrifying new forms.The downside of being a troubleshooter comes when trouble starts shooting back . . .;"*** 4 ***A buddy read with my friends Evgeny and Maria, because we need some Forward Momentum!!!This book starts about an year after the newly Weds tied the knot and are on their way back after a honeymoon. They are excited because right before their departure they began a family, placing a boy and a girl zigots in uterine replicators and they will be gestationaly mature enough to be born by the time they return home. Miles and Ekatherin are blissfully happy, until the ship is intercepted by an Emperial order for Miles to sort things out on a trade space station. The station is an Outpost of the Quaddies, a genetically engineered human race with for limbs, only all of them are hands, an advantage for work in Zero Gravity. We have met those very endearing, somewhat naive, joyful and hard working race of people before and I carry enormous love for them! So, it was not a surprise to find them just as wonderful as we did in our first encounter. However, you mix any genetically altered species with our rough-neck military Barrayaran soldiers and things get messy and potentially dangerous. Thus, the presence of the soldiers on top of Komaren trader ships, 1000 uterine replicators full of "" fetuses of mammals"", a fish-man, missing persons, possible murders, love-sick officer, and a random shooter, make Miles's life substantially more interesting, but just as dangerous... And as fast as he tries to solve the problems and keep the diplomatic damages to a minimum, the bigger the possibility that he might not make it home on time for his kids births increases... As he tries to put the puzzle pieces together, the possibility of never seeing his children at all fast becomes a probability. This book is much more of a murder mystery than any of the previous volumes. Miles is his usual, although very happily in love, self. His brashness and typical daring approach is somewhat tampered by his personal fears for his loved ones. We get to see Bell, the hermaphrodite, and his quaddy Nicole. It is also really nice to see what asset Ekatherin is when it comes to encouraging him, being his helpmate with her diplomatic manner and easy communication with all around her, and just by loving and believing in him. I was very pleased and impressed by her, despite the author being very subdued in her presentation to us. I also loved fish-man and was really hoping he would find his way to a certain Mercenary company I know of☺☺☺!For all those who have not taken the plunge into this series yet, I only have one question - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!???! Miles is one of the best characters ever to hit the Science Fiction genre. Period!!!Now I wish you all Happy Reading and many more wonderful books to come!!!❤";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61901.Diplomatic_Immunity
The Machine Crusade;Brian Herbert;2003;2000;800;3.8;16396;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Space'];"Alternate cover edition located here.The breathtaking vision and incomparable storytelling of Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson's Dune: The Butlerian Jihad, a prequel to Frank Herbert's classic Dune, propelled it to the ranks of speculative fiction's classics in its own right. Now, with all the color, scope, and fascination of the prior novel, comes Dune: The Machine Crusade.. More than two decades have passed since the events chronicled in The Butlerian Jihad. The crusade against thinking robots has ground on for years, but the forces led by Serena Butler and Irbis Ginjo have made only slight gains; the human worlds grow weary of war, of the bloody, inconclusive swing from victory to defeat.The fearsome cymeks, led by Agamemnon, hatch new plots to regain their lost power from Omnius--as their numbers dwindle and time begins to run out. The fighters of Ginaz, led by Jool Noret, forge themselves into an elite warrior class, a weapon against the machine-dominated worlds. Aurelius Venport and Norma Cenva are on the verge of the most important discovery in human history-a way to ""fold"" space and travel instantaneously to any place in the galaxy.And on the faraway, nearly worthless planet of Arrakis, Selim Wormrider and his band of outlaws take the first steps to making themselves the feared fighters who will change the course of history: the Fremen.Here is the unrivaled imaginative power that has put Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson on bestseller lists everywhere and earned them the high regard of readers around the globe. The fantastic saga of Dune continues in Dune: The Machine Crusade.";"Buddy read with Athena!""There are countless ways to die. The worst is to fade away without purpose.""After decades of standstill, the Butlerian Jihad is rising. The almost fanatical priestess Serena Butler and the power-hungry patriarch Iblis Ginjo have led it from an idea to a universe-spanning holy war. And in the spearhead of the movement stand the now legendary generals Vorian and Xavier, two brothers in arms whose surnames happen to be Atreides and Harkonnen.A curious statement that pulled this book from mediocrity to greatness: This is Dune.The Butlerian Jihad was something else. A depressing dystopia with little to no action and little to no connection with the most popular sci-fi universe in literature. In the second half of this book, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson take the series back to where it belongs, and starts building the setting for what is to come ten thousand years after these stories.""Long ago, we conquered the Old Empire, and then lost it to Omnius. Now, the Synchronized Worlds are weakened from decades of war against the free humans. The Army of the Jihad has worn down the thinking machines for us - an opportunity we must seize!""The wild cards of this story are fully unleashed. The treacherous Titans are conspiring against the machines and the free humans both. The legend of Selim Wormrider travels across the sands of Arrakis and leads a band of Zensunni slaves to the heart of Dune. From the schools of Ginaz, the greatest swordmaster in history arises. An Atreides sets foot on Caladan for the first time. Tensions are rising between the leaders of the Jihad. And Serena Butler uses all means to ignite the flames of war one last time. ""I am no more than a woman with a mission. That is all I have ever been."" Then she murmured, ""That is all I ever need to be.”This book did not only continue the story of the machine crusade with great success; it also started building the foundation of the rest of the series, and did so amazingly well. In contrast to the first book, this one definitely fit into the name of the trilogy: Legends of Dune. This is what I hoped for when I started reading these books.Unfortunately, a huge chunk of this book was incredibly boring. Not more so than almost the entirety of the first book, but still pretty disappointing. There was little plot development, little character development, little action. It still wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t exactly good either. Fortunately, about halfway through the book, it suddenly rose to become almost mind-blowingly amazing.From that point on, there are great twists and developments in every chapter. I felt that the authors never fully utilised the material they were working with in the first book, but here they’ve done a truly impressive job. The Prelude trilogy was like a breath of fresh air into the series when Frank Herbert’s writing grew tiresome, but this was like the best of both worlds. And the result is astounding for a Dune fan.So it turns out I can forgive hundreds of pages or practically nothing, when the remainder of the book is most likely the best part of the series since the Great Dune Trilogy, and certainly the best contribution by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson so far.I’ll finish off this review with the quote that truly made me love this book:""She saw mankind's future, with space-folding ships connecting a vast empire... a civilization that remained linked to the past through a long line of Sorceresses dressed in black, hooded robes.And she heard a harmonious, hypnotic chant from the desert: ""Muad'Dib...

Singularity Sky;Charles Stross;2003;2000;389;3.84;15626;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Singularity', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Time Travel'];In the twenty-first century man created the Eschaton, a sentient artificial intelligence. It pushed Earth through the greatest technological evolution ever known, while warning that time travel is forbidden, and transgressors will be eliminated.Distant descendants of this ultra high-tech Earth live in parochial simplicity on the far-flung worlds of the New Republic. Their way of life is threatened by the arrival of an alien information plague known as the Festival. As forbidden technologies are literally dropped from the sky, suppressed political factions descend into revolutionary turmoil.A battle fleet is sent from Earth to destroy the Festival, but Spaceship engineer Martin Springfield and U.N. diplomat Rachel Mansour have been assigned rather different tasks. Their orders are to diffuse the crisis or to sabotage the New Republic's war-fleet, whatever the cost, before the Eschaton takes hostile action on a galactic scale.;"The opening of Singularity Sky is as gripping as they come: one day, on the backwater planet of Rochard's World, telephones begin raining down from the sky. Everybody who picks one up is given a simple order: Entertain us, and we will grant your wish. And just like that, money, bicycles and replicator machines begin falling from orbit, and Rochard's World falls into chaos.Soon, the New Republic, a strict dictatorship, dispatches a fleet to deal with the enemies 'attacking' their colony. But in so doing, they put their entire civilisation at risk: for in trying to gain an advantage on the Festival, they plan on delving into time-travel, a technology sternly prohibited by the Eschaton, a transcendant AI controlling the fate of Humanity itself.Sounds good so far, doesn't it? Unfortunately, that's pretty much the point where the whole novel grinds to a halt. It's a sad statement on Charles Stross' storytelling abilities that he would go on to tell such a boring story based on such a strong setting, but here it is: the major part of the novel gets lost in cliché spy vs. spy stories aboard a capital ship run by two-dimensional military types.One major problem with Singularity Sky is determining whether Stross is serious or satirical throughout his novel. A lot of the happenings aboard the ship are one-sided and flat, and as far as espionnage stories go, they make James Bond look realistic. It's bad enough that Rachel Mansour, the sympathetic UN delegate, actually uses some sort of miraculous replicator luggage to do everything from staging a rescue to fabricating an escape pod. I kept having flashbacks to Rincewind's Luggage in Terry Pratchett's Discworld.Is the novel satire, then? It might well be, and it certainly includes some part that seem to be aimed for comedic effect. The major problem with satire, though, is consistency: Stross seems to alternate between moments of satire and seriousness, and it makes any attempt at emotional connection with his main characters totally impossible. At no point do they exceed the stereotypes they are meant to represent, and the relationships that eventually grow around them are unconvincing and bland.I understand that Stross is pretty popular with today's geek crowd, much like Cory Doctorow. Just like Doctorow, however, I find Stross entirely too rooted in modern ideals for my SF tastes. It seems that Stross built his future world not so much as an argument for his own view of the world, but as a vindication of it. It's at its most obvious when, near the end of the novel, his ""good guys"" engage in a totally one-sided argument with the representative of a controlling dictatorship, where the heroes treat their adversary like a child who has yet to discover that ""information wants to be free,"" and other such truisms. Such blatant geek wish-fulfillment might please other readers, but for me, it totally steals away my ability to suspend disbelief. I love SF novels that raise thought-provoking debates (of which Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is possibly the epitome); in the case of Singularity Sky, though, the whole thing is built as a one-sided monologue, and so accomplishes as much as the propaganda it so strongly decries.Another annoying tendency of Stross is to throw away references to modern times with total disregard to credibility. It's cheap, and it feels like Stross is pandering to the crowd by sacrificing the timeless qualities of his story. For instance, when describing some sort of exotic technology, a character reflects that the thing has:""...rather more computing power than the whole of the pre-Singularity planetary Internet.""That's well and dandy to give the readers a point of reference, but the reason most of the SF authors avoid such device is because it sounds as silly as if I went around claiming my word processor has ""more writing power than 2 medieval cloisters full of monk scribes"". It just doesn't make sense for future characters to refer to events and technologies that are so far in their own history.As a whole, Singularity Sky is as chock-full of bizarre and interesting ideas as the reviews made it out to be. Unfortunately, the grand canvas of ideas that Charles Stross has created is used to paint a boring story that never provides emotional resonance. Add to it a number of annoying writing habits, and all I can say about Singularity Sky is that it totally fails to live up to its own hype.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81992.Singularity_Sky
Trading in Danger;Elizabeth Moon;2003;2000;357;4.0;15509;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Space', 'Military Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Military Science Fiction'];Kylara Vatta is the only daughter in a family full of sons, and her father's only child to buck tradition by choosing a military career instead of joining the family business. For Ky, it's no contest: Even running the prestigious Vatta Transport Ltd. shipping concern can't hold a candle to shipping out as an officer aboard an interstellar cruiser. It's adventure, not commerce, that stirs her soul. And despite her family's misgivings, there can be no doubt that a Vatta in the service will prove a valuable asset. But with a single error in judgment, it all comes crumbling down.Expelled from the Academy in disgrace—and returning home to her humiliated family, a storm of high-profile media coverage, and the gaping void of her own future—Ky is ready to face the inevitable onslaught of anger, disappointment, even pity. But soon after opportunity's door slams shut, Ky finds herself with a ticket to ride—and a shot at redemption—as captain of a Vatta Transport ship.It's a simple assignment: escorting one of the Vatta fleet's oldest ships on its final voyage . . . to the scrapyard. But keeping it simple has never been Ky's style. And even though her father has provided a crew of seasoned veterans to baby-sit the fledgling captain on her maiden milk run, they can't stop Ky from turning the routine mission into a risky venture—in the name of turning a profit for Vatta Transport, of course.By snapping up a lucrative delivery contract defaulted on by a rival company, and using part of the proceeds to upgrade her condemned vehicle, Ky aims to prove she's got more going for her than just her family's famous name. But business will soon have to take a backseat to bravery, when Ky's change of plans sails her and the crew straight into the middle of a colonial war. For all her commercial savvy, it's her military training and born-soldier's instincts that Ky will need to call on in the face of deadly combat, dangerous mercenaries, and violent mutiny. . . .;"OK, I'll admit it: I'm a sucker for space opera. Have been ever since my grandfather gave me a copy of E.E. ""Doc"" Smith's ""Galactic Patrol"" to read back when I was 9 years old. Always will be. And ""Trading in Danger"" is space opera....I cracked the book shortly before midnight last night and finished it around 4AM. I'm a fast reader, but I'm not that fast. Frankly, there's a fair amount of fluff... lots and lots of details that neither advance the plot nor provide significant additional insight into the main character (since, as has been noted by another reviewer, there aren't really other any other complex or interesting characters). The high fluff rating of the book could be because Moon is trying to pump out too many books too quickly, or it could be because she isn't that good a writer. I have only read one other book by her (""The Deed of Paksenarrion""), and I didn't think too much of it, so I'm inclined to guess that it is the latter. But you know what? I don't care. It's a space opera, it has a fast-moving plot hinting (albeit blatantly) at much larger complexities, it has action, it has space-ships, it has good guys and bad guys... so I liked it.If you haven't read everything by David Weber, or S. M. Stirling, or Lois McMaster Bujold, or Sharon Lee & Steve Miller, or even E. E. ""Doc"" Smith (who although dated has in some ways never been equalled), all of whom are superior practitioners of the same genre, then you have better things to do than read Moon. But if you need a fix while waiting for the next book from the above, then ""Trading in Danger"" hits the spot. Best of all? As of today there are four sequels to read... excuse me while I head off to Amazon....";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/284658.Trading_in_Danger
Sandworms of Dune;Brian Herbert;2007;2000;494;3.69;15482;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Classics'];At the end of Frank Herbert's final novel, Chapterhouse: Dune, a ship carrying a crew of refugees escapes into the uncharted galaxy, fleeing from a terrifying, mysterious Enemy. The fugitives used genetic technology to revive key figures from Dune's past--including Paul Muad'Dib and Lady Jessica--to use their special talents to meet the challenges thrown at them.Based directly on Frank Herbert's final outline, which lay hidden in two safe-deposit boxes for a decade, Sandworms of Dune will answer the urgent questions Dune fans have been debating for two decades: the origin of the Honored Matres, the tantalizing future of the planet Arrakis, the final revelation of the Kwisatz Haderach, and the resolution to the war between Man and Machine. This breathtaking new novel in Frank Herbert's Dune series has enough surprises and plot twists to please even the most demanding reader.;"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***This is part two of Dune 7, or at least Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's interpretation of how Frank Herbert may have intended it based on a supposed outline and notes they'd found of the book. I ripped apart part one of Dune 7, Hunters of Dune, in my previous review, but believe it or not, that book was better and more enjoyable than this one, but not by much. Sandworms of Dune was one of the worst books I've ever read, in terms of plot, pacing, character development, dialogue, writing style...basically, in any category in which you would judge a book's worth, this book was the pits. I must note that I am placing 99% of the blame squarely on the shoulders of Kevin J. Anderson, who's horrendous writing style, apparent in every one of his ""100 books, half of them bestsellers, selling over 20 million, etc"" in his own words, is smeared and slapped on every page of these awful, awful books.In a nutshell, this story tells, again, in excruciatingly boring detail, the story of the struggle between humans and thinking machines. Yes, it's really that basic, and really as stupid as a Terminator-style fight between evil robots bent on slaughtering humans for no apparent reason other than revenge, and people fighting back. Throughout it all, we get more gholas, more characters from the old books brought back for no apparent reason other than ""it would be cool,"" (more on this later), and more one-dimensional character ""development,"" or in the case of KJA's style, character ""devolution."" Because, you see, the characters in these Dune 7 books act and talk NOTHING like they did in the previous 6 real Dune books by Frank Herbert. Here we have Bene Gesserit sisters showing loads of emotions, for example, when they had always been in complete control of their feelings and expression of them in previous books. The entire ""Dune babies"" storyline has dialogue so stiff and lame that it makes young Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode I seem eloquent by comparison. And the stupid midichlorian tangent from that movie is better than a lot of the reasons given in this book for why things happen (too many for me to detail, not that you'd want me to, anyway...trust me).The characters in these books act so STUPID you're shocked they survived beyond a few chapters previously. Example: Face Dancers had infiltrated the no-ship and were sabotaging it. One of the characters says he can create a poison that only kills Face Dancers and doesn't affect true humans. He says he can make it into a gas. Another character, who's supposed to be a military genius, asks ""what good will that do?"" After some back and forth, he exclaims ""Oh, I get it! We can run it through the air vents and it will only kill Face Dancers!"" Really? A supposed legendary military mind in these books, the great Miles Teg, is that dense? This is but one of numerous examples in these books.I could go on and on but I'm so sick of these books that I don't want to. However, what truly makes them awful is the last 100 pages or so, when every defeat of the villains is accomplished so easily that it's amazingly anticlimactic, and there are seriously six to seven deus ex machina solutions to every problem such that the entire books ends up being wrapped up so neatly and tidily that it's absurd. It has one of those ""and they all lived happily ever after"" feelings, which, after what is supposed to be described as the final struggle for the survival of humanity, is again limp and anticlimactic. Humans and machines living in harmony singing Kumbaya and holding hands...gee, how nice!Anderson's typical introduction of the ""ultra"" or ""ultimate"" anything gets so ridiculous that I literally laughed out loud (""ULTRAspice,"" ULTIMATE Kwisatz Haderach,"" etc). Seaworms, sandworms morphing into giant ""Monarch"" worms, Duncan Idaho described as a ""superman."" As one poster on an internet message board stated, these books pass the KJA ""wouldn't it be awesome?"" test, in that you can find every new thing they introduce and picture him thinking ""wouldn't it be awesome if worms lived in the sea?"" for example.The most infuriating this about these books is that it's clear they COMPLETELY misunderstood everything Frank Herbert was trying to get across in his 6 books. The Butlerian Jihad was a crusade against thinking machines such that humanity was becoming too dependent and complacent with the assistance of mass automation, and they rebelled against it such that they vowed never to let their inherent and natural abilities and talents go to waste again. It was a way to ensure humanity would flourish and evolve over the millennia. KJA and BH turned this into a mindless fight against killer Terminator robots (who just appear out of nowhere) and humans. Stupid. And Frank Herbert had said REPEATEDLY that he introduced ""hero"" characters who turned out to be eminently flawed and corruptible to shatter the myth of the hero who saves the day and conquers all and the blind devotion of humans throughout history to follow such a character, often to ultimate ruin. And what to KJA and BH do? Introduce the newest superman, ULTIMATE Kwisatz Haderach Duncan Idaho. And get this...near the end of the book, he contemplates how he will not be corrupted by his immense power as so many before him have, and solves the problem buy simply stating to himself, ""I won't let that happen."" Problem solved. Case closed. Ludicrous. Equally galling are the CONSTANT references to the non-canon events in the stupid ""prequel"" books KJA and BH have written, repeated AD NASEUM in these Dune 7 books to the point of making me angry enough to slam the book down. How many times to we have to read about Paul ""almost being assassinated"" by Fenring? Or the ridiculous histories of their laughable ""Oracle of Time"" or ""Serena Butler?"" And don't get me started on the ridiculous ENEMY, who turn out to be cross-dressing smarmy robots, again their own creations, Omnius and Erasmus (yes, the names are that stupid), who also end up being so easy to defeat. We're to believe they've spent 15,000 years plotting revenge on the humans, and have slaughtered trillions of humans throughout Dune 7, yet Omnius is simply whisked away by the Oracle in a matter of a paragraph, while Erasmus cuts a deal with Duncan basically over a handshake (""I'll stop slaughtering humans if you promise to be nice to us.""). I couldn't make stuff this idiotic up. And the constant attempts to tie-in more of their fanfic as canon is truly disgusting. Basically, these two books would make an excellent film for Mystery Science Theater 3000 to rip apart, and at least then, they'd be slightly enjoyable!I'm going to stop now because I could go on forever, but if you read my review of Hunters of Dune and this book, you'll get a clear picture of how I really feel about these bastardizations and how I and LOADS od others worldwide do not consider anything these guys have written as canon or ""real"" Dune. It's fanfic aimed at Young Adult/Tweens that is being passed off as legit, but it's not. Don't fall for it.And as with Hunters of Dune, there are a smattering of interesting ideas or plot threads that I attribute to Frank Herbert himself (based on his outline, which they claimed to be doing for these entire books), but these are few and far between. In fact, if you add them all up, they'd amount to what you'd expect from...an outline. And not the ""copious notes"" they claimed to have found for this book. No one buys that excuse from them anymore, and no one buys their books anymore, either, judging from the dismal sales and the cancellation of the latest series of ""interquels.""Stick to the 6 original Frank Herbert books and use your imagination to come up with how he may have finished the saga in Dune 7 had he lived. He certainly wouldn't have changed it into a cheesy planet-hopping whizz-bang-pow shoot 'em up space opera ala Star Wars the way these guys did. I may read their ""prequel"" and ""interquel"" Dune books just for some laughs, as I know I'll never accept them as canon, although after reading their insipid attempt at Dune 7, I'm not sure I want to put myself through that.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42434.Sandworms_of_Dune

He swallowed. “Isn’t this kind of…illegal?”“He wants to know if it’s illegal,” the other John said, amused. “You’re a funny guy, Hack. Yes, it’s illegal, killing people without their consent, that’s very illegal.”Vice-President John said, “But the question is: what does it cost? Even if we get found out, we burn a few million on legal fees, we get fined a few million more… bottom-line, we’re still way out in front.”(c)Q:Hack sat in traffic, biting his nails. This had not been a good day. He was beginning to think that visiting the marketing floor for a cup of water was the worst mistake he’d ever made.(c)Q:“Well, that’s cheaper. We can make sure we don’t take out anyone with means. For, you know, retribution. And you need ten capped, so there’s a bulk discount. We could do this for, say, one-fifty.”(c)Q:Jeeps were one of the safest vehicles on the road, Buy had read; safe for people in the Jeep, anyway.(c)Q:Until recently, Buy had thought that moving to a USA country was the best move he’d ever made, with the possible exception of changing his name from Jean-Paul.(c)Q:“I know first aid.” Not many people did; there was too much risk of being sued. (c)Q:“Nine-eleven Emergency, how can I help you?”“I need an ambulance. Quickly, a girl has been shot at the Chadstone Wal-Mart mall.”“Certainly, sir. Can you tell me the girl’s name?”“Hayley. Hayley something. Please, come straight away.”“Sir, I need to know if the victim is part of our register,” the operator said. “If she’s one of our clients, we’ll be there within a few minutes. Otherwise I’m happy to recommend—”“I need an ambulance!” he shouted, and it was only when water splashed on his hand that he realized he had started to cry. “I’ll pay for it, I don’t care, just come!”“Do you have a credit card, sir?”“Yes! Send someone now!”“As soon as I confirm your ability to pay, sir. This will only take a few seconds.”He looked at the faces around him. “Someone help her. Help her!” The kid who had loaned Buy his cellular knelt down and held the jacket over the wound. A girl began stroking Hayley’s hair. Buy dragged his wallet out from his back pocket and retrieved his credit card. Hayley’s eyes were fixed on him. I promise, he told her. I promise. “I have American Express—”“That’s fine, sir. Could you read your card number to me, please?”“Nine seven one four, oh three—”Two shots rang out from somewhere below them, close. The people around him shrieked and fled; only the kid stayed, crouching lower.“—six six—”People were screaming. Something hit the ground—or one of the Mercedes?—with a deafening boom.“Sir? Are you there? I didn’t catch the number, sir.” “Nine seven—”The kid put his hand over Buy’s. “Mister…I don’t think it matters.”Hayley was no longer looking at him. Her eyes were turned upward, at the Nike Town sign, at the fluorescent lights. Her face was white.“Oh, no,” Buy said. “No, please.”“Sir?” the operator said. “Can you please repeat your credit card number for me, sir? Sir? Are you there? Sir? Sir?”(c)Q:Hack, what you just saw was a press release. We have no intention of hunting down the people responsible, because the people responsible are us. All right?(c)Q:“You want to know why Americans took over the world, Hack? Because they respect achievement. Before this was a USA country, our ideal was the working-class battler, for Christ’s sake. If Australians ruled the world, everyone would work one day a week and bitch about the pay.” He shook his head. “Then there’s the British, who thought there was something wrong with making money. No surprise they ended up kissing the colony’s ass. The Japanese, they think the pinnacle of achievement is a Government job. The Chinese are Communist, the Germans are Socialists, the Russians are broke…who does that leave?”“Canada?”“America,” John said. “The United fucking States of America, the country founded on free-market capitalizm. I tell you, those Founding Fathers knew their shit.”(c)Q:“You mean the one time you did something nice for no reason, the person died?”(c)Q:He reddened. “Well, we still need that information. It may not seem important to you, but this is a serious suit.”She couldn’t help it: she looked at his suit.(c)Q:In order to pursue the perpetrators, we need funding, yes. The Government’s budget only extends to preventing crime, not punishing it. For a retributive investigation, we can only proceed if we can obtain funding.(c)Q:Hack said. “See, there’s this body in my kitchen—”“You’re meant to call first,” the agent said. “To set up an appointment. We can’t drop everything just because you walk in.”(c)Q:He smiled. Trespass was an assault against property and therefore a crime, but fraud was fine: fraud was practically a constitutional right, like free speech.(c)Q:";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33356.Jennifer_Government
Ashes of Victory;David Weber;2001;2000;672;4.19;15123;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Military Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space'];"The People's Republic of Haven made a tiny mistake when it announced the execution of Honor Harrington. It seemed safe enough. After all, she was already dead. Unfortunately, they were wrong. Now Honor has escaped from the prison planet called Hell and returned to the Manticoran Alliance with a few friends. Almost half a million of them, to be precise including some who know what really happened when the Committee of Public Safety seized power in the PRH. Honor's return from the dead comes at a critical time, providing a huge, much-needed lift for the Allies' morale, for the war is rapidly entering a decisive phase. Both sides believe that victory lies within their grasp at last, but dangers no one could foresee await them both. New weapons, new strategies, new tactics, spies, diplomacy, and assassination all are coming into deadly focus, and Honor Harrington, the woman the newsies call ""the Salamander,"" once more finds herself at the heart of them all. But this time, the furnace may be too furious for even a salamander to survive.";"If you read my review of the previous book, Echoes of Honor, I mentioned it was an awesome basic story hampered by some real annoyances. Well, the annoyances are the same, but much worse. The basic story is still great & the ending is, again, just awesome. (It doesn't star Honor, either!) Info dumps - There are too many of them & he's expanding beyond the necessary - an ugly trend that has gotten way worse - adding in details & back story that I don't much care for. I just don't see where it helps the story beyond padding it. This time we're talking half a dozen pages on communication. Please! I realize that an author has to do a butt load of research for even a fictional book, but I really, really don't want to read even the condensed version unless it really helps the story along. This didn't.Good point - my skimming skills are increasing under Weber's tutelage. I can skim an info dump for the high points at warp speed. ;-) This was a 2 star book because of all the annoyances, but I'm giving it 3 because the basic story is excellent as is the ending. More, I'm going on to the next book, War of Honor, because his universe has expanded nicely in several ways - if you like politics. I never cared for them before, but I'm more in the mood for them this time.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77742.Ashes_of_Victory
Fallen Dragon;Peter F. Hamilton;2001;2000;808;4.08;14641;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Military Fiction'];From science fiction master Peter F. Hamilton comes a standalone novel that is “a fascinating, compulsively readable clash of hardware and ideals”, political intrigue, and space opera at its best (Kirkus Reviews (starred review)). In the distant future, corporations have become sustainable communities with their own militaries, and corporate goals have essentially replaced political ideology. On a youthful, rebellious impulse, Lawrence joined the military of a corporation that he now recognizes to be ruthless and exploitative. His only hope for escape is to earn enough money to buy his place in a better corporation.When his platoon is sent to a distant colony to quell a local resistance effort, it seems like a stroke of amazing fortune, and Lawrence plans to rob the colony of their fabled gemstone, the Fallen Dragon, to get the money he needs. However, he soon discovers that the Fallen Dragon is not a gemstone at all, but an alien life form that the local colonists have been protecting since it crashed in their area. Now, Lawrence must decide if he will steal the alien to exploit the use of its inherent biotechnical processes — which far exceed anything humans are capable of — or if he will help the Resistance get the alien home.;"hi there! *
review
: Hamilton is a surprisingly contemplative writer in this rare (only?) standalone novel. he layers diverse and often opposing ideas about identity, ambition, globalization, colonialism, and corporate (ir)responsibility atop a fun and compelling narrative chock-full of detailed world-building. the story pits a revolutionary against a disgruntled corporate mercenary; neither are mere talking heads for their respective perspectives on life and how to live it, both continually confound expectations. the author strives, as always, for an even-handed approach, and succeeds. the book also features a lovely Golden Age-style science fantasy that has major impact on the main story surrounding it - a nice precursor to the fascinating parallel fantasy narrative he embedded within his Void series. a very enjoyable novel despite its frequent inconsistencies and occasional missteps in characterization.you probably should just skip the rambling that follows.anyway... you're a regular sort of person who likes the occasional bout of binging on quality and maybe not-so-quality tv, right? don't even talk to me if you are the sort of person who doesn't even own a tv because of whatever reason. i admire your strength but you may as well be from mars. anyway, let's say you like to binge-watch some tv. that's a large group of people.ok let's narrow it down some. are you also a fan of binge-watching science fiction or fantasy tv shows? I'm not talking high quality stuff like say Battlestar Galactica or Westworld or the earlier seasons of Game of Thrones, but something a bit more low-brow like um Farscape. that's probably a smaller group of people. but still a big bunch of people!can you enjoy binging on those tv shows despite the internal inconsistencies and the often flat but fun characters and the sometimes eye-rolling melodrama? you are entering into a different world when you binge-watch so you have to suspend some disbelief. the main thing is that the person who created these worlds really believes in them, in their product, in the world they are creating. there may be irony, but not so much irony that distance is being created between viewer and world. there may be a central narrative, but because these are 12-26 episode tv serials, the narrative is just one thing of many things, and many of those many things are about building a world and giving life to all of its settings. ok, that may be a slightly smaller group of people, but that's still a lot of people.A Recommendation for This Group of PeopleRead This Book!also, don't complain about its length. PLEASE. if you can spend 12-26 hours binge-watching a tv show, you should be down for a big fat doorstopper of a book like this one. live in its world for chrissakes! it's a lot of fun and you get to live in it for a whole bunch of hours. stop being so impatient and stop being so hooked on that central narrative. it's not all about the narrative all the time! it's about living in a place.* drunk review";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45258.Fallen_Dragon
The Years of Rice and Salt;Kim Stanley Robinson;2002;2000;763;3.75;14556;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Alternate History', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Speculative Fiction'];It is the fourteenth century and one of the most apocalyptic events in human history is set to occur - the coming of the Black Death. History teaches us that a third of Europe's population was destroyed. But what if? What if the plague killed 99 percent of the population instead? How would the world have changed? This is a look at the history that could have been: a history that stretches across centuries, a history that sees dynasties and nations rise and crumble, a history that spans horrible famine and magnificent innovation. These are the years of rice and salt.;"Christmas 2010: I realised that I had got stuck in a rut. I was re-reading old favourites again and again, waiting for a few trusted authors to release new works. Something had to be done.On the spur of the moment I set myself a challenge, to read every book to have won the Locus Sci-Fi award. That’s 35 books, 6 of which I’d previously read, leaving 29 titles by 14 authors who were new to me.While working through this reading list I got married, went on my honeymoon, switched career and became a father. As such these stories became imprinted on my memory as the soundtrack to the happiest period in my life (so far).2003 was a wonderfully rich and diverse year for Sci-Fi and Fantasy!My beloved Locus Sci-Fi Award went to this, Robinson’s 

Years of Rice and Salt

The Scar

American Gods
 took the Nebula.The prestigious Hugo was awarded to Sawyer’s

The Years of Rice and Salt

. I’d only read one other Robinson before – 
Red Mars
, many years before – and found it tough going at the time (but that’s another review). I chucked this into my suitcase for my honeymoon, content that if it was too much of a grind for around-the-pool reading, my wife was packing plenty of lighter fantasy fare I could borrow.My fears were all for naught – this is totally different kettle of fish to the Mars Trilogy.Alternative history premise: the black plague obliterated Europe and the Eastern civilizations scrap over global conquest.Story lens: reincarnation! A small family (?) of souls reincarnate in different forms and relationships with each other over ten novellas covering seven hundred years in a great karmic cycle.I like Buddhism. I like alternative histories. I like the interlinked novella approach.For holiday reading, this was perfect. I devoured a novella every time we took one of Malta’s quirky buses to a tourist trap. I sipped at them leisurely while lounging on the beach. I chatted about the wonderful ideas with my new wife while we enjoyed room service on our balcony. I loved the little between-life moments of the reincarnation.By turns this book made me excited and tranquil. It reminded me a little of David Mitchell’s brilliant 
Ghostwritten
 with a touch of Wilbur Smith in each little adventure. It was one of those books I didn’t want to end. Surely there could be one more reincarnation? One more story? I’m surprised by the number of negative reviews I’ve found, I guess it helps that I’ve always held Buddhist inclinations. I give this five-stars without hesitation.Not long after we returned from our honeymoon one our cats, Callie, escaped and was killed on the road near our flat. She was the prettiest, most affectionate kitty I’ve ever met – adored by all who met her (even dog people). When I found out that she had died, it was this book that came to mind. One of the stories involves a soul 'demoted' to a life as a tiger for one cycle.I told my wife that Callie “was just too good to be a cat and they had to call her spirit back so she could be reincarnated as a person”. The idea was comforting. Those words were still in my head when, very shortly after, I discovered we were having a child. When I look into my baby son's eyes now, I wonder if, just maybe, there’s a bit of Callie's endless curiosity looking back. That makes me happy.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2723.The_Years_of_Rice_and_Salt
The Battle of Corrin;Brian Herbert;2004;2000;704;3.79;14423;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Space'];Alternate cover edition located here.Following their internationally bestselling novels Dune: The Butlerian Jihad and Dune: The Machine Crusade, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson forge a final tumultuous finish to their prequels to Frank Herbert's Dune.It has been fifty-six hard years since the events of The Machine Crusade. Following the death of Serena Butler, the bloodiest decades of the Jihad take place. Synchronized Worlds and Unallied Planets are liberated one by one, and at long last, after years of victory, the human worlds begin to hope that the end of the centuries-long conflict with the thinking machines is finally in sight.Unfortunately, Omnius has one last, deadly card to play. In a last-ditch effort to destroy humankind, virulent plagues are let loose throughout the galaxy, decimating the populations of whole planets . . . and once again, the tide of the titanic struggle shifts against the warriors of the human race. At last, the war that has lasted many lifetimes will be decided in the apocalyptic Battle of Corrin.In the greatest battle in science fiction history, human and machine face off one last time. . . . And on the desert planet of Arrakis, the legendary Fremen of Dune become the feared fighting force to be discovered by Paul Muad'Dib in Frank Herbert's classic, Dune.;"Buddy read with Athena!The distance between greatness and disaster can sometimes be so depressingly short.The second half of The Machine Crusade was good enough to force a five-star rating from me, but all in all, the Legends of Dune trilogy has been the least impressive part of the Dune universe so far. And this was arguably the worst book of the three. I’ll not call it a huge disappointment, for with the aforementioned exception, this trilogy has been more or less on a stable level throughout. But it was not good.Only two things made this book worth reading: first of all, the origins of the legendary feud between Houses Atreides and Harkonnen. I had anticipated it would turn out to be something like this, but in the end I was still horrified by it. And to be honest, the whole scenario behind the enmity seemed entirely forced. It took an Atreides and a Harkonnen to go completely out of character to provide us with a rather unsatisfactory explanation. But it still was worth reading this book just to actually get to know.And second, which is actually a positive point, that Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, unlike the former’s father, actually realise the importance of opening and finishing up a book with spectacular, epic writing. In my review of The Butlerian Jihad, you can find the opening passage of the trilogy, and here is the last passage of it. Arguably the best way a Dune book has ended so far.""The broad expanse of sand kept its own time. As tides of change and history swept from planet to planet across the galaxy, the endless desert on Arrakis scoured away all attempts to manipulate or tame it. The arid environment preserved artifacts, while ferocious sandstorms erased anything in their path. Spice prospectors came and went, and the worms destroyed many of the unprepared interlopers. But not all of them.The outsiders kept coming, drawn by the lure and legend of the spice melange.Even as empires rose and fell, Arrakis, the desert planet, would turn its face to the universe and endure.""The only unfortunate thing is that those lines were better than the rest of the book combined.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99220.The_Battle_of_Corrin
172 Hours on the Moon;Johan Harstad;2008;2000;368;3.54;14127;no;['Horror', 'Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Space', 'Mystery'];Three teenagers are going on the trip of a lifetime. Only one is coming back. It's been more than forty years since NASA sent the first men to the moon, and to grab some much-needed funding and attention, they decide to launch an historic international lottery in which three lucky teenagers can win a week-long trip to moon base DARLAH 2 - a place that no one but top government officials even knew existed until now. The three winners, Antoine, Midori, and Mia, come from all over the world. But just before the scheduled launch, the teenagers each experience strange, inexplicable events. Little do they know that there was a reason NASA never sent anyone back there until now-a sinister reason. But the countdown has already begun. . .;"This is the dumbest book I've read this year. Granted, we're only a few days into 2016, but the fact remains that this book is awful. Here are the reasons why:1. Everyone says OMG THIS BOOK IS SO SCARY. It was not. It was boring. 50% of the book is spent introducing us to the bratty and annoying Mia, the token Japanese girl (she's Japanese so she can tell scary Japanese stories), and the spectacularly unmemorable Mia2. It was boring. Seriously. You could skip to the last 15% of the book and know what you need to know3. Zero character development. Completely needless moment of romance where Mia and Antoine know each other for all of a few pages and all of a sudden kisses. Like what? Why? Where did that come from?4. It was boring. In case I haven't made that quite clear5. It was hilariously, spectacularly, hysterically unbelievable.Let me talk to you for a moment about willing suspension of disbelief. It is a tool passively exercised by the reader to believe what we read in a book is within the realm of possibility. Vampires exist, you say? So it shall me.In order for willing suspension of disbelief to happen, there has to be an iota of credibility, some tiny fragment that makes our mind say ""this could be true, there's a slight chance this might happen."" It sets up for the enjoyment of a book. That's what powers the imagination, the spark of possibility.As for this book, my book reaction is: BWAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LOLOLOL ARE YOU FUCKING SHITTING ME? Because there is no way in hell anything in this book is believable.The premise: NASA runs out of funding, so they decided to hold a publicity event to send some random ass 14-18 years old to the moon.WHAT?! WHAT THE FUCK?! In what universe is that even remotely possible?! It takes astronauts years and years of training, advanced degrees, physical and mental tests have to be passed in order to get chosen for a mission. And they're selecting KIDS and sending them up there with little to no training at all?! Throw in three kids and have them talk to each other when they're all from different countries?! Completely absurd. I can't for a single moment forget how dumb this premise is. It is the book's responsibility to make me feel like what happens is a possibility, and this book did not do that.Plus, it was so boring, guys.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12810834-172-hours-on-the-moon

He's lived long enough to see the cure for death and the end of scarcity, to learn ten languages and compose three symphonies...and to realize his boyhood dream of taking up residence in Disney World.Disney World! The greatest artistic achievement of the long-ago twentieth century. Now in the keeping of a network of ""ad-hocs"" who keep the classic attractions running as they always have, enhanced with only the smallest high-tech touches.Now, though, the ""ad hocs"" are under attack. A new group has taken over the Hall of the Presidents, and is replacing its venerable audioanimatronics with new, immersive direct-to-brain interfaces that give guests the illusion of being Washington, Lincoln, and all the others. For Jules, this is an attack on the artistic purity of Disney World itself. Worse: it appears this new group has had Jules killed. This upsets him. (It's only his fourth death and revival, after all.) Now it's war....";"One of the many complaints I hear about Cory Doctorow's Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom is that it is ""shallow."" Readers see a shallowness in character, a shallowness in the work they choose, a shallowness in story depth, and a shallowness in the story's morality. I don't see it myself. Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom may seem shallow, but there is a great deal of depth to be found if one approaches the book with a willingness to overcome the prejudices and perspectives of our current culture, to project oneself into the mindset and morality of the future world Doctorow has created.I won't go into the story itself with any detail, as I don't want to spoil anything, but Doctorow's finest achievement in Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom is the way he explores the question of morality. In a world where death and disease are over, where scarcity is barely remembered, it becomes clear that morality, even our morality today, is formed and shaped by mortality -- or the lack thereof.The only real immorality in Down and Out seems to be the destruction of another's work. Only the tangible creations of an individual or a team (""ad-hoc"") have value. Adultery, theft, destruction and even murder have no real negative value. They may reduce a person's prestige (""Whuffie"") for a short time, but it is not difficult for the ""victim"" of any of these crimes to remain close friends or become close friends with his or her ""victimizers"" once he or she is ""rebooted.""What this suggests for ourselves is fascinating: that morality itself is based on our mortality. The shortness of our lives, the moment of death that we all face, is the ultimate arbiter of what is right and wrong. I am sure some would say, ""So what? That doesn't change anything. Wrong is wrong. Bad is bad. Evil is evil."" Perhaps. But perhaps not, and what makes Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom a victory for me is that it makes me wonder about the perhaps not.Anything that makes us consider our morality rather than just blindly accepting what has been passed down to us is a good thing, as far as I am concerned. And so that leaves me with one nagging question: how can a book that expects us to make considerations about mortality and morality really be considered shallow? Very simply, it can't be.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29587.Down_and_Out_in_the_Magic_Kingdom
War of Honor;David Weber;2002;2000;869;4.13;13708;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Military Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space'];"NO ONE WANTED ANOTHER WARThomas Theisman didn't. After risking his life and a fresh round of civil war to overthrow the Committee of Public Safety's reign of terror and restore the Republic of Haven's ancient Constitution, an interstellar war was the last thing he wanted.Baron High Ridge didn't. The Prime Minister of Manticore was perfectly happy with the war he had. No one was shooting anyone else at the moment, and as long as he could spin out negotiations on the formal treaty of peace, his government could continue to milk all those ""hostilities only"" tax measures for their own partisan projects.His Imperial Majesty Gustav didn't. Now that the fighting between the Star Kingdom and the Havenites had ended, the Andermani Emperor had his own plans for Silesia, and he was confident he could achieve them without a war of his own.Protector Benjamin didn't. His people had made too deep a commitment to the Manticoran Alliance, in blood as well as treasure, for him to want to risk seeing it all thrown away.And Honor Harrington certainly didn't. The ""Salamander"" had seen the inside of too many furnaces already, knew too much about how much war cost.Unfortunately, what they wanted didn't matter....";"David Weber writes the Honor Harrington series, and the early books (those that I've read) were actually pretty good. It's high-quality space opera, starring a starship captain in the far-future version of the Royal Navy. The books are -- somewhat sketchily -- drawn from the same Napoleonic-era sources as the Aubrey-Maturin series, or the Hornblower series. (The lead bad guy in Nouveau Paris in the early books is named ""Rob S. Pierre"", get it?) Honor Harrington is a character in the Hornblower tradition of audacity, competence, and awkwardness, and when Weber writes about her, it's done with brio and panache. Harrington's a natural leader, with the guts and energy needed for high command, along with an incapacity to suffer fools that gets her into frequent feuds with those selfsame fools. I am reading the series somewhat out of sequence -- blame my service -- and wasn't a bit surprised that War of Honor was a letdown. The ninth or tenth volumes of any sci-fi or fantasy saga tend to be potboilers at best, unreadable at worst. I wasn't expecting anything really good or outstanding from War of Honor, just a quick read and then move on to the next target, er, book. I regret to have to tell you that War of Honor is almost laughably bad. It is the sort of book that cries out for an editor, or maybe even an author. It is overstuffed, padded, and upholstered, but somehow not comfortable. There are basically two problems with War of Honor, either of which could be fixed in about fifteen minutes with the editing features in Microsoft Word. It is not that the novel is too long. I would welcome -- I suppose -- a really long Honor Harrington novel if it were a novel about Honor Harrington. This is not that. Instead, War of Honor is about politics, and not in a good way. Weber falls into the common trap of being overly interested in his fantasy world, which is about as bad as being overly interested in your fantasy baseball team. It's important for me to know that I have Grady Sizemore and Hideki Matsui and Jason Bay in my fantasy outfield, but you could care less, and I wouldn't think to bore you about it. So there's pages -- chapters -- whole sections of discussions of the political situation in the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the Republic of Haven. There were similar chapters in previous books, mind you, but those chapters usually were pretty skinny, and they usually featured the politicians b!tching about poor Honor. Now, there's more stuff in the book -- by a factor of about eleven -- about the ""High Ridge Government"" and its nefarious deeds than there is about starships blowing up. This is unforgivable, and mean-spirited to boot. Basically, all one would have to do would be to highlight the e-text of War of Honor, delete all the chapters about political matters, and stick to the story. However, that gets us into the second problem. The plot of War of Honor is recycled - hell, not even that. It's like it's been passed down through the generations like some heirloom, and brought out for special occasions. Yet again, the political operatives have stuck poor Honor out on the sharp end of the spear, putting her in an impossible position against superior enemy fire -- and she manages to fight her way through yet again, burnishing her reputation in the process. But even with high-tech editing solutions, there really isn't much to be done with War of Honor. This is because Weber has lost sight of what made the prior books so fun -- not just space battles, but the character of Honor herself. So much of what happens in War of Honor has nothing to do with its title character, which is a mistake as large as the Manticore Junction. When she appears at the end of the book to save the day, it's almost an afterthought, and that's a shame.

A Neanderthal physicist, Ponter Boddit, accidentally passes from his universe into a Canadian underground research facility. Fortunately, a team of human scientists, including expert paleo-anthropologist Mary Vaughan, promptly identifies and warmly receives Ponter. Solving the language problem and much else is a mini-computer, called a Companion, implanted in the brain of every Neanderthal. A computerized guardian spirit, however, doesn't eliminate cross-cultural confusion; permanent male-female sexuality, rape, and overpopulation are all alien to Ponter. Nor can it help his housemate and fellow scientist back in his world, Adikor Huld, when the authorities charge Adikor with his murder.";"(Homo sapiens and four other human species)The Smithsonian National Museum has listed twenty-one human species that are recognized by most scientists. These are just the ones we know about and have fossil evidence of and I think we will unearth many more.We homo sapiens are far from unique, though we like to think we are. We think we're special and everything on earth was made for us. We used to think (and some still do) that this blue planet of ours was the center of the universe, and a supreme being created it all just for us. It was probably sheer good luck that let us survive when all other human species went extinct. I like to imagine what it would be like if one or more of the others had survived, and we were sharing Earth with cousins even closer than chimps and bonobos. Would we get along or would we find reasons to hate the other species because they are different? Unfortunately, the latter is likely, given how we treat members of our own species who we think are different. In Hominids, Robert J. Sawyer imagines a parallel universe in which it is the Neanderthals who survived, while we homo sapiens went extinct. Ponter and Adikor are physicists working on quantum computers. They accidentally open a portal into another universe, the one in which homo sapiens survived and Neanderthals went extinct. Ponter is thrown into our universe, a universe he hadn't known existed. Thankfully he has a Companion implanted in his arm that quickly learns English and can communicate with the odd-looking people he finds himself among. I absolutely loved this book. Mr. Sawyer has created a stunning Neanderthal world and it was amazing to read about their advanced culture and see how they are different to us, how they are the same, and how they are superior in many ways. Neanderthal do not have religion and it was invigorating to read the passages where humans try to explain the concept of a Creator, an afterlife, and a soul to Ponter who is incredulous over such ideas. The book switches back and forth between the two universes and I enjoyed them both equally. I loved seeing Ponter interact with ""us"", learning our ways. I also loved being in the Neanderthal world, learning about their advanced technology and almost crime-less society. This book is thought-provoking, imaginative, and fun!I do have a couple bitches though:• Mary is a world-renowned geneticist, having been the first to successfully extract Neanderthal DNA from a fossil. But we are to believe she reads Harlequin romances and is embarrassed to say she's on her period.  Then there's this cringe-inducing, eyeball-rolling phrase illustrating her attraction for Porter: ""She swiveled her head to watch his buns as he disappeared into the kitchen"". Oh come on! That is stupid and immature and downright silly. Thankfully there's not a lot of this sort of thing in the book or it would have ruined it for me.• Another bitch is that, while the Neanderthals are bisexual and all have a female and male mate, they think sex between a male and female is the only ""real"" sex and it's just fun genital stimulation when the act is between members of the same sex. I don't know if that's the author's thoughts or he just made it up, but it's stereotypical bullshit and pissed me off.It says a lot for the book that I'm still giving it five stars. It's amazing. I devoured it in a day because I couldn't concentrate on much else, with my brain having been transported to that parallel universe.

Her grueling all-day Examination has just begun, and if she passes, she’ll be admitted into the Academy—the elite governing institution of her utopian society. But Anax is about to discover that for all her learning, the history she’s been taught isn’t the whole story. And the Academy isn’t what she believes it to be. In this brilliant novel of dazzling ingenuity, Anax’s examination leads us into a future where we are confronted with unresolved questions raised by science and philosophy. Centuries old, these questions have gained new urgency in the face of rapidly developing technology. What is consciousness? What makes us human? If artificial intelligence were developed to a high enough capability, what special status could humanity still claim? Outstanding and original, Beckett’s dramatic narrative comes to a shocking conclusion.;"5.0 stars. Okay folks, this is a must read alert. I was expecting this to be decent but I was blown away by how excellent it turned out to be. Focused, powerful and imaginative. This one is a keeper. As many others have said (but it is certainly worth repeating) this should not be considered a YA novel. Yes, the protagonist is a teenage girl, but that is the only YA connection to this story. This has much more in common with 1984 than Harry Potter. This is a superbly realized and eerily believable dystopian SF story that deals with some important issues. The book also has a very original framing narrative device. The main character, Anax (short for Anaximander), is undergoing a final exam of sorts that will take place over a 5 hour period. The entire story takes place within these 5 hours and through her examination, the story of the history of the world, the creation of the dystopian society (of course they don’t see it that way) and how the society is presently constituted. The novel is only 150 pages long which tracks the 5 hour length of the exam. I listened to the audio version and it was almost exactly 5 hours long and kept pace with the time in the novel (i.e., 30 minutes in the story was pretty much 30 minutes of the audio book). I thought this was clever as was using an “exam” as the narrative format it provides a great vehicle to describe the world. Suddenly any exposition and background information becomes simply part of the oral exam. Again, very well done. One of the fundamental themes explored in the novel is fear and the effect that it can have on breaking down a society (sound familiar). The exploration of this issue is intelligent, and credible way and I was very impressed with how deftly it was portrayed by the author. The language is very readable but also incredibly thought-provoking. For example, in addition to the excerpt I quoted above, here is a passage where Anax is responding to a question about the causes for our world’s decline which led to the formation of the “Republic” of the story: 
 Superstition is the need to view the world in terms of simple cause and effect. As I have already said, religious fundamentalism was on the rise, but that is not the type of superstition I am referring to. The superstition that held sway at the time was a belief in simple causes. Even the plainest of events is tied down by a thick tangle of permutation and possibility, but the human mind struggles with such complexity. In times of trouble, when the belief in simple gods breaks down, a cult of conspiracy arises. So it was back then. Unable to attribute misfortune to chance, unable to accept their ultimate insignificance within the greater scheme, the people looked for monsters in their midst.The more the media peddled fear, the more the people lost the ability to believe in one another. For every new ill that befell them, the media created an explanation, and the explanation always had a face and a name. The people came to fear even their closest neighbors. At the level of the individual, the community, and the nation, people sought signs of others’ ill intentions; and everywhere they looked, they found them, for this is what looking does. This was the true challenge the people of this time faced. The challenge of trusting one another. And they fell short…
 Uh….does anyone else think that people could be making very similar statements about the times we live in 100 years from now? Personally, I thought this was a brilliant depiction of the extremes that fear can lead people. This has earned a spot among my very favorite dystopian stories. It is an extraordinary novel full of important ideas and also a stark commentary on where we are now. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6171892-genesis
Ball Lightning;Liu Cixin;2004;2000;384;3.79;12509;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'China', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Asian Literature'];A new standalone military SF adventure from the bestselling and award-winning author of The Three-Body Problem.When Chen’s parents are incinerated before his eyes by a blast of ball lightning, he devotes his life to cracking the secret of mysterious natural phenomena. His search takes him to stormy mountaintops, an experimental military weapons lab, and an old Soviet science station. The more he learns, the more he comes to realize that ball lightning is just the tip of an entirely new frontier in particle physics. Although Chen’s quest provides a purpose for his lonely life, his reasons for chasing his elusive quarry come into conflict with soldiers and scientists who have motives of their own: a beautiful army major with an obsession with dangerous weaponry, and a physicist who has no place for ethical considerations in his single-minded pursuit of knowledge.Ball Lightning, by award-winning Chinese science fiction author Cixin Liu, is a fast-paced story of what happens when the beauty of scientific inquiry runs up against a push to harness new discoveries with no consideration of their possible consequences.The original Chinese version was published in 2004. In 2018 the English version, translated by Joel Martinsen, was published in the US by Tor Books.;"3.5/5 starsCixin Liu greatly examined the effects of obsession, science, and weaponry in Ball Lightning.I’m a fan of Cixin Liu’s Remembrance of Earth Past trilogy. The second book in that series, The Dark Forest remains in my personal top three sci-fi novels of all time and will most likely stay there for a very long time. Plus, the fact that Ball Lightning is translated by Joel Martinsen, the same translator of The Dark Forest, made me eager to read this one.Picture: Ball Lightning Chinese cover

“The key to a wonderful life is a fascination with something.”

But then what happened when that fascination turns into an obsession? The story of the book starts when Chen’s parents are incinerated by a blast of ball lightning right before his eyes. After this event, Chen immediately decided to devote his entire life to unravel the secret behind the occurrence of the ball lightning. Science, physics, and the theme of obsession with something is the core of the story in the novel. Cixin Liu did a great job on the story, themes exploration, and science aspect of the book. Reading Liu’s books, even though it’s hard sci-fi and I didn’t understand some parts, always felt thought-provoking and quite easy to follow. Cixin Liu isn’t merciless like Hannu Rajaniemi. In my opinion, the lack of exposition in Rajaniemi’s Jean le Flambeur series was brutal, ten times worse than Malazan Book of the Fallen; this could totally be because I’m better versed in reading fantasy than sci-fi though. However, Liu prepared some time to explain the scientific parts he’s talking about in detail so I didn’t feel completely lost. In order words, Cixin Liu backed all his theories with exposure and that’s something I highly appreciate in the hard sci-fi genre.

“That’s what scientific research is. Every step you’ve taken, no matter how absurd, is a necessary one.”

The downsides to this book to me are the same as the flaws I found in The Three-Body Problem: the characterizations were completely neglected. Even though the story was mostly told in first person narration, the characterizations were still flat. This isn’t like Dark Forest or Death’s End where Cixin Liu utilized a more evident character-driven narration; science and physics are top priorities here. There was only one memorable character inside this book and that was only because I’ve read the Remembrance of Earth’s Past trilogy. Not only the characterizations were lacking, the storytelling direction was also quite damaging to the pacing of the book. There were two occasions in the book where the character was telling his/her story; this was done in a lecture form of narrative. I’m talking about ONE dialogue that goes on for almost an entire chapter without a single break or attention to the environment/characters surrounding the storyteller. It was extremely boring and tedious; to me, it totally felt like being forced to attend a lesson where the teacher talked about his/her life in full detail but we, as the student had to remain in absolute silence both verbally and physically.Remember, this book serves as a prequel and was written before The Three-Body Problem got published. Cixin Liu has come a long way as an author since this piece of work and I’m still looking forward to reading his newest book. If you have a great understanding of physics and you’re okay with reading a sci-fi novel that put science discussions as the main driving force of the story—at the same time neglecting its characterizations—Ball Lightning will most likely be a hit for you.

Thirteen;Richard K. Morgan;2007;2000;544;3.9;12450;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Crime'];The future isn’t what it used to be since Richard K. Morgan arrived on the scene. He unleashed Takeshi Kovacs–private eye, soldier of fortune, and all-purpose antihero–into the body-swapping, hard-boiled, urban jungle of tomorrow in Altered Carbon, Broken Angels, and Woken Furies, winning the Philip K. Dick Award in the process. In Market Forces, he launched corporate gladiator Chris Faulkner into the brave new business of war-for-profit. Now, in Thirteen, Morgan radically reshapes and recharges science fiction yet again, with a new and unforgettable hero in Carl Marsalis: hybrid, hired gun, and a man without a country . . . or a planet.Marsalis is one of a new breed. Literally. Genetically engineered by the U.S. government to embody the naked aggression and primal survival skills that centuries of civilization have erased from humankind, Thirteens were intended to be the ultimate military fighting force. The project was scuttled, however, when a fearful public branded the supersoldiers dangerous mutants, dooming the Thirteens to forced exile on Earth’s distant, desolate Mars colony. But Marsalis found a way to slip back–and into a lucrative living as a bounty hunter and hit man before a police sting landed him in prison–a fate worse than Mars, and much more dangerous.Luckily, his “enhanced” life also seems to be a charmed one. A new chance at freedom beckons, courtesy of the government. All Marsalis has to do is use his superior skills to bring in another fugitive. But this one is no common criminal. He’s another Thirteen–one who’s already shanghaied a space shuttle, butchered its crew, and left a trail of bodies in his wake on a bloody cross-country spree. And like his pursuer, he was bred to fight to the death. Still, there’s no question Marsalis will take the job. Though it will draw him deep into violence, treachery, corruption, and painful confrontation with himself, anything is better than remaining a prisoner. The real question is: can he remain sane–and alive–long enough to succeed?2007 1st Ed Del Rey 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1;"Richard K. Morgan is kind of hot shit in the sci-fi world these days, but this book does not demonstrate why. At 550 pages, it's a ridiculously long thriller wrapped in a shroud of William Gibson-esque cyperpunk. Morgan has a lot of interesting ideas about human genetic modification in the future, and how it all ties into the political intrigue of the time, but his actual plot, at least in this book, is an overly complicated murder mystery that fails to pay off in any way whatsoever. The main character, a modified ""thirteen"" with incredible killing powers, is cool enough at first, but becomes quickly unlikable as he proceeds to slaughter human after human, both good and bad. The book is a stylized, tough, crime thriller in a sci-fi setting, which would have been cool had it had any likable characters, or a story that didn't completely bore me. Even at close to 600 pages Morgan can't find a way to explain what is going on until the last 50 pages, when major characters sit in a room and engage in agonizing dialog that serves no other function than revealing backstory. The rest of the book is spent watching the main character and his crime-bustin' allies wander from one part of the world to another, figuring out very little and occasionally participating in fairly cool action scenes. Morgan seems smart enough, but this book is incredibly, unnecessarily indulgent, with the most egregious example being the THREE-PAGE scene describing the Thirteen titty-humping his love interest in a back alley. I'm all for a good titty-hump, don't get me wrong, but a Hustler-style recap of one isn't a good way to legitimize a sci-fi novel that otherwise takes itself very, very seriously.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40448.Thirteen

But the Gbaba can detect the emissions of an industrial civilization, so the human rulers of Safehold have taken extraordinary measures: with mind control and hidden high technology, they've built a religion in which every Safeholdian believes, a religion designed to keep Safehold society medieval forever.800 years pass. In a hidden chamber on Safehold, an android from the far human past awakens. This ""rebirth"" was set in motion centuries before, by a faction that opposed shackling humanity with a concocted religion. Via automated recordings, ""Nimue"" - or, rather, the android with the memories of Lieutenant Commander Nimue Alban - is told her fate: she will emerge into Safeholdian society, suitably disguised, and begin the process of provoking the technological progress which the Church of God Awaiting has worked for centuries to prevent.Nothing about this will be easy. To better deal with a medieval society, ""Nimue"" takes a new gender and a new name, ""Merlin."" His formidable powers and access to caches of hidden high technology will need to be carefully concealed. And he'll need to find a base of operations, a Safeholdian country that's just a little more freewheeling, a little less orthodox, a little more open to the new.And thus Merlin comes to Charis, a mid-sized kingdom with a talent for naval warfare.

For an entertaining and thought provoking blend of science fiction and fantasy, this also gets high praise. But ... It is very long, tends towards space opera melodrama and somewhat collapses under its own weight. It was also formulaic and predictable, though in fairness to Weber, he fills in the predictable gaps with great attention to detail.

I briefly toyed with doing the same for my review, but then I remembered that I already did that, and it wasn't that amusing.Then I thought maybe I would do the whole thing in code like a l33t haXor, which would have been appropriate since this book finds it the height of amusement to throw around with-it language like ""n00b"" and ""pwned.""Then I realized that it is obnoxious to force readers to suffer an affected writing style or stylistic quirk unless you have a really good reason, and ""because it's cute and mildly thematically relevant"" is not a good enough reason, are you listening, Charles Stross?I did not like this book, perhaps because it is about the online gaming community, by which I mean obsessives who spend way too much time playing World of Warcraft, and my idea of a video game binge still tends more toward playing through all of Super Mario World in one night. Maybe if you play Everquest enough to think it is funny to call it ""Evercrack"" (do people still play EverQuest?), then this book is a hilarious romp of in-jokes and references.If you do not, though, it is a dull, unimaginative slice of near-future sci-fi that was quite possibly dated before the manuscript was fully edited. Near-future stuff is tough because if you predict wrong, you just look silly (where are the intergalactic army brigades of 1997, Joe Haldeman?). Stross plays it safe by predicting almost nothing. In 202X, we'll all still be playing online games with fantasy-themed avatars and using the same tired netspeak. The only difference is we will use VR goggles (the future of 1994!) and the U.K. will have collapsed (also the U.S. economy, oh, daring). Everyone will be a gamer, to the point where a virtual crime committed inside of a game could have global economic effects to the tune of billions of Euros! Possibly. I admit I didn't quite follow all of it.But basically, it goes like this: crime is committed inside a video game when a bunch of in-game objects (spells, swords, treasure) are stolen. Cops and insurance companies get involved and investigate. Larger conspiracies unfold. It almost sounds interesting. But then the first 2/3 are all about setting up the gaming culture, describing avatars, going off on tangents about how you'll be able to check Yelp! reviews in the future using a virtual in-glasses display (no, really, there is a long bit about looking up a good restaurant online), and poorly developing a cast of four stock point-of-view characters via the aforementioned unwise decision to write entirely in second person (I guess because YOU are the character in this video game obsessed narrative). (And to clarify: that means that the ""you"" you are reading about is referencing four samey characters, which can make it hard to remember who you are at any given time, even though the chapter titles tell you which character is featured.) Only in the last part are the real stakes revealed, if by ""revealed"" you mean ""explained via a series of confusing expository conversations.""The worst are the ""action sequences"" set inside a game, which clearly have absolutely no real world impact and are thus about as interesting as watching your nerdy cousin play X-Box.

From the sleek ships of the glimmering Coruscant skyscape to the lush gardens of pastoral Naboo, dissent is roiling. The Republic is failing, even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, elected ten years earlier to save the crumbling government. Separatists threaten war, and the Senate is hopelessly divided, unable to determine whether to raise an army for battle or keep the fragile peace. It is a stalemate that once broken, could lead to galactic chaos.Mischievous and resolved, courageous to the point of recklessness, Anakin Skywalker has come of age in a time of great upheaval. The nineteen-year-old apprentice to Obi-Wan Kenobi is an enigma to the Jedi Council, and a challenge to his Jedi Master. Time has not dulled Anakin’s ambition, nor has his Jedi training tamed his independent streak. When an attempt on Senator Padmé Amidala’s life brings them together for the first time in ten years, it is clear that time also has not dulled Anakin’s intense feelings for the beautiful diplomat.The attack on Senator Amidala just before a crucial vote thrusts the Republic even closer to the edge of disaster. Masters Yoda and Mace Windu sense enormous unease. The dark side is growing, clouding the Jedi’s perception of the events. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, a slow rumble is building into the roar of thousands of soldiers readying for battle. But even as the Republic falters around them, Anakin and Padmé find a connection so intense that all else begins to fall away. Anakin will lose himself—and his way—in emotions a Jedi, sworn to hold allegiance only to the Order, is forbidden to have.Based on the story by George Lucas and the screenplay by George Lucas and Jonathan Hales, this intense and revealing novel by bestselling author R.

Well, fellow readers in the Force, you know the drill by now, if you have been reading my reviews about Star Wars film novelizations, but if not, and you have fall in the carbonite complex, therefore, not having watched the film from this novelization was made, well, stop reading, since I’ll do some spoilers. Don’t say I didn’t warn you!
LOVE AT FIRST FORCE
Well, good ol’ Georgie is a business genius, and certainly quite good in many film aspects, but developing a love story isn’t between his skills……I can understand that young Anakin had a huge crush on Padme, come on! She’s Natalie Portman! And she didn’t change a bit in 10 years (never told but I have to assume that people from Naboo aged quite slowly), so what started as a cute chlid crush, evolved into an almost out of control crush……BUT PADME???!!!Last time, she saw Anakin, he was a small tender innocent kid, but she only needed a glimpse of him, already grown up and her Naboonian female hormones started to shake up!I know that it’s not an easy task to present a believable romance in the big screen since true love needs time, and you have time against you in a movie, especially if it’s not a romance film per se, but a sci-fi action movie with some romance elements on it.Therefore, I think they should play with the angle that the movie didn’t start right away from the previous one ended, in fact, 10 years later, sooooo, they could employ the moving yellow words at the beginning of the film, and explain that Anakin had been personal bodyguard of Padme for at least 6 months, and Jedi-Kapow! You can read (literally!) between lines that Anakin and Padme have been close for a fair amount of time and they fell in love during that time.
WORST ACCOUNTING EVER
I am an accountant, so maybe I am a geek with an unique vision about the thing with the Clone Army……that mysterious Sifo-Dyas paid to the people in Kamino to raise a vast Clone Army. You can bet that it wasn’t any cheap……and the Jedi Council never notice that they didn’t have a good amount of their money anymore in their arcs???!Also, Yoda, Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi, didn’t have a single clue about how the heck the Kaminoans claimed to be paid by the Jedi to make the Clone Army, but they didn’t hesitate a second to take them and put them into a “slave-like” service for the Republic (good thing that “slavery” didn’t exist in the Republic anymore!).And nobody followed the money involved!!! Not all battles are won with lightsabers. They only to track the accounting books.What the heck they were doing in the Jedi Council? Only looking “cool” in their seats?! They are the leader of the Jedi Order, so they should at least one time per year to check their finances.Why taking such extremes like Order 66? Palpatine only needed an Audit Intervention and the whole Jedi Council could end in jail for money embezzlement! And if their funds weren’t used in that (Darth Sidious and Darth Plagueis could take the money from other part), still the Jedi could be charged for property (the clones) misappropiation.And in any case, if the Jedi have so much money……couldn’t they pay for the freedom of poor Shmee Skywalker, only to avoid some mental stress to Anakin, and he could stay in the safe side of the Force?!
WORST SHAPE-SHIFTER EVER
Mmh……why the heck, you create a Shape-Shifter Bounty Hunter, but she keeps her original outfit?! Even more ridiculous, wearing a veil in her helmet, why a veil to hide her face if she can change it?!Yes, it’s more believable that she only change her physical body and not also her clothes, but this is where you have to avoid falling into too realism…“Oooh! How odd, I was just chasing a female bounty hunter with your exact clothes, but nope, you have to be another person, since your face is different, yeah.” Geez!!!
JANGO & DOOKU
Jango Fett and Count Dooku must be the best things in the movie…Jango Fett, since he has a cool Mandalorian armor, and ANYBODY is cool with a Mandalorian armor. And while he wasn’t that effective against Jedis, well, anybody without Force powers isn’t that effective against Jedis, but just watch how many Jedis has survive against true Siths, and you realize that poor Jango wasn’t that bad really.About Count Dooku, sure, he’s a pale replacement of Darth Maul (even if he was Dracula before, no offense), but Dooku’s best moment is when he tells openly to Obi-Wan what is really going on, that a Dark Lord of the Sith is controlling the Republic, and dang Obi-Wan didn’t believe him!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320361.Star_Wars
Gridlinked;Neal Asher;2001;2000;423;3.96;12235;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy'];"Gridlinked is a science fiction adventure in the classic, fast-paced, action-packed tradition of Harry Harrison and Poul Anderson, with a dash of cyberpunk and a splash of Ian Fleming added to spice the mix.Cormac is a legendary Earth Central Security agent, the James Bond of a wealthy future where ""runcibles"" (matter transmitters controlled by AIs) allow interstellar travel in an eye blink throughout the settled worlds of the Polity. Unfortunately Cormac is nearly burnt out, ""gridlinked"" to the AI net so long that his humanity has begun to drain away. He has to take the cold-turkey cure and shake his addiction to having his brain on the net.Now he must do without just as he's sent to investigate the unique runcible disaster that's wiped out the entire human colony on planet Samarkand in a thirty-megaton explosion. With the runcible out, Cormac must get there by ship, but he has incurred the wrath of a vicious psychopath called Arian Pelter, who now follows him across the galaxy with a terrifying psychotic killer android in tow. And deep beneath Samarkand's surface there are buried mysteries, fiercely guarded.This is fast-moving, edge-of-the-seat entertainment, and a great introduction to the work of one of the most exciting new SF talents in years.";The entry point of another great, complex space-opera series, Asher´s Polity universe, offers everything a Sci-Fi fan can wish for. Like the behemoths of the genre Hamilton, Scalzi, Banks, Reynolds, Simmons, etc., Asher has created an authentic, complex world, bursting with fresh, creative Sci-Fi ideas. Especially interesting is the idea of the influence of human and alien AIs that are not just entities of their own, but may be open or even dependent on a second kind of evolution. They may, parallel to lonely learning, expanding and rewriting and optimizing their own code and added machinery and production capacity, unite and fuse with aliens and humans in different grades of severity.This can be symbiotic, parasitic, psychotic, traumatic, etc. for both involved, depending on how much feelings an AI can perceive and control. The motive or programming of the AI to share its immense capacity with something as slow as an alien or human opens up the option to describe both the AIs and the persons' main plot goals. Both parties could, with or without consent or noticing it, assimilate, manipulate, destroy, help, etc. each other. Does the machine become humanoid or does the soft shell become like an AI and what is the better model, if it is even possible to objective point the finger on the more attractive lifestyle? This concept is a fresh, unspent idea and could find use in Social Sci-Fi, for instance with different, competing transhumanist concepts like a technocratic, cold, more machine than cyborg woman slowly getting interested in a Gaia-hyping, bioengineered, eco-friendly terraforming Psiguy. It would be an interesting exaggeration of gender stereotypes when the male and female roles are reversed and caricatured.Tropes show how literature is conceived and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98046.Gridlinked

Glasshouse;Charles Stross;2006;2000;335;3.88;11437;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook', 'Speculative Fiction'];When Robin wakes up in a clinic with most of his memories missing, it doesn’t take him long to discover that someone is trying to kill him. It’s the twenty-seventh century, when interstellar travel is by teleport gate and conflicts are fought by network worms that censor refugees’ personalities and target historians. The civil war is over and Robin has been demobilized, but someone wants him out of the picture because of something his earlier self knew.On the run from a ruthless pursuer and searching for a place to hide, he volunteers to participate in a unique experimental polity, the Glasshouse, constructed to simulate a pre-accelerated culture. Participants are assigned anonymized identities: It looks like the ideal hiding place for a posthuman on the run. But in this escape-proof environment, Robin will undergo an even more radical change, placing him at the mercy of the experimenters—and at the mercy of his own unbalanced psyche...;John Scalzi claims to be a gateway drug into science fiction literature, I suppose he may well be but I believe Charles Stross is almost the opposite of that. Stross is deservedly one of the most popular active sci- fi authors today but readers not familiar with the genre may find him a little bewildering. His target readership seems to be those who are quite au fait with the common tropes of the genre and also some computer programming terms. Those “in the know” love the science he puts in books like  Accelerando and  The Atrocity Archives while the likes of me struggle. I certainly had problems understanding much of these two books but less so with  Singularity Sky. It did occur to me that his fiction is probably not for me but I keep coming back to try again because I like his wit and imagination, plus he is a great guy and very approachable to readers in online forums and such. Today I am happy to say I have finally found a Stross novel that I absolutely love and works completely for me. It is Glasshouse.This Hugo nominated novel is set in the 27th century when our 21st century is viewed as part of “The Dark Ages”, presumably pre-singularity (called “the acceleration” here). Most of the book takes place in a sealed experimental environment where participants sign up to reenact life in the 21st century for research purposes. The protagonist starts off as a man named Robin who has part of his memory deleted for reasons unknown, presumably to forget some traumatic experience that he wants to do without. After he signed up for the isolated social experiment he backs himself up and his backed up personality wakes up inside the experiment as a woman called Reeve who has no idea why she has chosen to change her gender. She soon settles down to a married life of a nuclear family as part of the experiment, but begins to feel that the “experiment” is not really an experiment and some very disturbing things are going on.Io9 calls Glasshouse “One of Stross' most challenging books”, I have not read enough of his books to confirm or deny this but I do find it to be his most accessible book so far. Certainly some tech expositions still go over my head but they never impede the storytelling. Whenever I don’t feel inclined to Google the programming terms I was able to gloss over them and enjoy the story. I do hope many more Stross books are like this, and I intend to find out. I don’t remember any of Stross’ characters from his other books that I have read but I doubt I will forget the main characters in this book. This is particularly true for Robin/Reeve whose experience and character growth is unlike anything I have read before. The book is surprisingly feministic in tone after Robin becomes Reeve. Stross seems to have a lot of empathy for the trials and tribulations of womanhood. The emotions, the interactions with other women, the social pressure etc. are all convincingly portrayed (I hesitate to say accurately portrayed as I am not of the gender). Interestingly once Robin’s backup is activated as Reeve we have no idea what becomes of the original Robin, but with all these backups and restores we don’t even know whether the original Robin ever appears in this book. As for Reeve, she has to be one of the most unreliable narrators ever (I won't tell you why though).Of course regularly readers of Charles Stross are probably not exactly looking for books that deal with feminist issues, I imagine the cool tech to be his main attraction. Glasshouse is stuffed to the gills with cool sci-fi tech. The posthumanism reminds me of both  Altered Carbon and  Permutation City*, the memory editing is similar to PKD’s short story  We Can Remember It for You Wholesale (filmed a couple of times as “Total Recall”). However, this is not a derivative novel, the sum of the different influences make for a very original book which is mind blowing, thought provoking and even poignant at times. The wilds ideas and amazing tech are underpinned by a surprisingly touching story of a loving relationship.Glasshouse is definitely the best Charles Stross book I have read so far and I hope that even better ones are in store for me.__________________________* Unlike the virtual world featured in Permutation City, the social experiment of Glasshouse takes place in an actual physical environment where the activated digitized personalities are stored in human bodies.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17866.Glasshouse
At All Costs;David Weber;2005;2000;855;4.21;11435;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Military Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];What Price Victory?The War with the Republic of Haven has resumed...disastrously for the Star Kingdom of Manticore. Admiral Lady Dame Honor Harrington has been recalled from the Sidemore System to command Eighth Fleet. Everyone knows Eight Fleet is the Alliance's primary offensive command, but what most of the public doesn't know is that not only are the Star Kingdom and its Allies badly outnumbered by the Republic's new fleet, but that the odds are going to get steadily worse.Eighth Fleet's job is to somehow prevent those odds from crushing the Alliance before the Star Kingdom can regain its strategic balance. It's a job which won't be done chaply. Honor Harrington must meet her formidable responsibilities with inferior forces even as she copes with tumultous changes in her personal and public life.The alternative to victory is total defeat, yet this time the cost of victory will be agonizingly high.;"Somehow after reading several Neal Stephenson novels, Weber's verbosity has become More irritating, not less. Stephenson's critics complain that he needs a good, strong, editor, but after reading the Quicksilver series I really don't know what I'd cut. On the other hand, it would be simplicity itself to scale back a Harrington novel by 30% or more. Seriously, do we Really need a blow-by-blow on a signed treecat conversation?! The other traditional complaints apply as well: Harrington is more than a little too perfect, to the point of a more than occasional wince from the reader, and a good number of the characters are just too good to be true as well - too honorable, too honest, too understanding... And yet, after I waded through the first 50 or 75 pages, I was hooked and kept reading eagerly all the way through the Battle of Manticore. And I just placed holds on a couple other anthologies in the series so I could figure out what actually happened on Torch / Verdant Vista. (Which, of course, brings me to another complaint. The Honorverse has fractured considerably by this point, and simply reading all of the books in the Honor series itself is going to leave a reader in the dark about a few minor (or not so minor) points. It'd been a year since I read the Honor book before this one, and I spent a long time wondering if I'd simply forgotten a whole series of plot points. Turns out I hadn't: they're covered in spin-off series. But even reading through the Honorverse Wiki doesn't entirely simplify the task of figuring out in which order to read everything... I think the books themselves need to be published with a good, solid ""key."") But for all these complaints, the plot is Really quite good. It takes a good author to make you care almost as much about an ""enemy"" character's death as one of the ""good guys,"" and it really is fascinating to see how two relatively honorable, non-evil societies can find themselves battling to the death even though (almost) no-one actually wanted it.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77732.At_All_Costs
The Speed of Dark;Elizabeth Moon;2002;2000;369;4.0;11322;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Autistic Spectrum Disorder', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Disability', 'Fantasy'];"In the near future, disease will be a condition of the past. Most genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Unfortunately, there will be a generation left behind. For members of that missed generation, small advances will be made. Through various programs, they will be taught to get along in the world despite their differences. They will be made active and contributing members of society. But they will never be normal.Lou Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap the awards of medical science. Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact. He has taught himself to use “please” and “thank you” and other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable. He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself.But then his quiet life comes under attack. It starts with an experimental treatment that will reverse the effects of autism in adults. With this treatment Lou would think and act and be just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical music–with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world–shades and hues that others cannot see? Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings? Would it be easier for her to return the love of a “normal”?There are intense pressures coming from the world around him–including an angry supervisor who wants to cut costs by sacrificing the supports necessary to employ autistic workers. Perhaps even more disturbing are the barrage of questions within himself. For Lou must decide if he should submit to a surgery that might completely change the way he views the world . . . and the very essence of who he is.Thoughtful, provocative, poignant, unforgettable, The Speed of Dark is a gripping exploration into the mind of an autistic person as he struggles with profound questions of humanity and matters of the heart.From the Hardcover edition.";"This book is about as 'sci fi' as an episode of CSI. Moon basically takes 'Flowers for Algernon' and hacks off the ending. The writing was alright, and there was some interesting characterization, but I suspect it only got the Nebula and Clarke because award committees love nothing as much as political correctness. This book is the equivalent of an actor making an Oscar bid by playing a mentally-challenged character.I know Moon is a sci fi author, but in this book, it feels like she just stamped on the 'Sci-Fi' label in order to draw an audience, or perhaps because her publisher refused to authorize a genre switch. I hope that isn't true, because that's always a cheap move. This is just modern pop-fiction, an 'emotionally confessional' book with a veneer of 'vaguely near-future'. This wouldn't have been a problem if Moon had used this opportunity to explore human psychology, which was how 'Algernon' and 'A Clockwork Orange' treated this same theme, but she didn't. She rehashed half of an interesting idea, and failed to capitalize on it. Speculative Fiction has always been obsessed with what makes us human, and how much we can change before we stop being human at all. While that should be the main theme of this book, it goes almost unexplored.The climax is rushed and inauthentic. We never actually see the character change, we don't witness the effects as they happen, instead they are lightly explained in choppy montage at the end. Compared to the rest of the book--an internal, step-by-step presentation of a fairly different mind--this sudden, convenient, external ending is disappointing and jarring.The denouement following the climax is particularly tidy, with all the subtlety of the end of an 80's college movie where we learn through super-imposed text that ""Barry went on to win the Nobel prize"" to the strains of Simple Minds.And it's a shame, because the story leading up to the climax is interesting enough, presenting the psychological workings of autism. Moon researched this disorder much better than Mark Haddon in his laughably flawed 'Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night Time', but then, Moon's son is actually autistic. There was also a part about fencing, which excited me at first, being a former competitive fencer and coach, but instead, it was just weird SCA dressup boffing. Not that I have anything against SCA dressup boffing (or do I?).It's an alright read, goes pretty quick, and it might give you some insight into brain disorders, but it doesn't tie human experiences together; which is really a shame, because other sci fi books have successfully used this topic to ask some very difficult and profound questions about how the future of technology might change the way we think, and about the different ways people process information.'Flowers for Algernon' tackled the exact same themes and was written sixty years before Moon's less profound attempt. You'd think we'd have something more to say after sixty years of neurology and psychology, but apparently not. It also pales in comparison with 'A Clockwork Orange', another good light sci fi which explores the morality of changing the way that people think.This book was light and fluffy, especially given its subject matter, and while it will probably make soccer moms feel proud of themselves for reading something so 'different', it doesn't endeavor to change the way they think about humanity, the mind, or the possibilities within us.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96063.The_Speed_of_Dark

Archaeologist Verity Auger specializes in the exploration of its surviving landscape. Now, her expertise is required for a far greater purpose.Something astonishing has been discovered at the far end of a wormhole: mid-twentieth century Earth, preserved like a fly in amber. Somewhere on this alternate planet is a device capable of destroying both worlds at either end of the wormhole. And Verity must find the device, and the man who plans to activate it, before it is too late—for the past and the future of two worlds…;If one can´t avoid the nanocaust, try at least fixing the problem with the help of time travel.Now that´s a completely different Reynolds novel than one is used to, no extremely far future with unbelievable highly developed tech, but instead with 2 relatively close futures, or even presents, or pasts, clashing together in a classical thriller crime style plot that is suspenseful until the end.Reynolds´single novels are something for true hardcore fans, because standalone novels have the problem of being trickier to write for authors than already established series in which they just have to return to and the readers already know and love. So, it´s more difficult for the average reader without foreknowledge to get in, the writer has to invest much more time in dangerous expositions and, well, in the case of the complex and sophisticated style Reynolds excels at, it´s just something for real hard sci-fi fans. But, on the other hand, it´s also a bit easier to follow with just 2 parallel storylines, so I am not really sure where to go with my reading suggestions, maybe average hard sci-fans who don´t want the complexity of a series that needs time to get in? Tricky.However, it´s a tour de force of everything that makes the genre so great, tropes en masse, action, classic detective style maybe as an homage to Asimov, technologies, etc. sigh, heart, what else can one wish for?I wish Reynolds would have expanded a bit more towards the very close and very far future in the Revelation Space series itself, just as Hamilton did with his universes, because it would be amazing to see what comes before and after, how extremely detailed and fascinating the explanations and worldbuilding might be.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89192.Century_Rain
Transition;Iain M. Banks;2009;2000;404;3.87;11038;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Thriller', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Space'];"There is a world that hangs suspended between triumph and catastrophe, between the dismantling of the Wall and the fall of the Twin Towers, frozen in the shadow of suicide terrorism and global financial collapse. Such a world requires a firm hand and a guiding light. But does it need the Concern: an all-powerful organization with a malevolent presiding genius, pervasive influence and numberless invisible operatives in possession of extraordinary powers?Among those operatives are Temudjin Oh, of mysterious Mongolian origins, an un-killable assassin who journeys between the peaks of Nepal, a version of Victorian London and the dark palaces of Venice under snow; Adrian Cubbish, a restlessly greedy City trader; and a nameless, faceless state-sponsored torturer known only as the Philosopher, who moves between time zones with sinister ease. Then there are those who question the Concern: the bandit queen Mrs. Mulverhill, roaming the worlds recruiting rebels to her side; and Patient 8262, under sedation and feigning madness in a forgotten hospital ward, in hiding from a dirty past.There is a world that needs help; but whether it needs the Concern is a different matter.";"Posted at HeradasTransition reads like it was intended to kick off a new series for Banks, and like Consider Phlebas, the first in Banks’ Culture series, it was kind of a hot mess but I loved it anyway. There’s just so much room in the universe of Transition for more stories featuring the Concern / l’expérience. The concept is so large that there is the potential for all of Banks’ fiction to take place inside of it. Even the Culture could’ve existed inside of this. It’s massive. I’m kind of mourning that loss of potential future stories right now. Something I find myself doing more and more after I finish reading an Iain Banks novel these days. Who even knows if he intended to return to this universe, but it could’ve been spectacular if he did. The bottom line is: Fuck cancer.Strangely enough, Transition was published in the UK as a mainstream Iain Banks novels, but in the US under his Iain M. Banks pseudo pseudonym that Orbit used for his science fiction novels. His mainstream literary novels never took off in America (they’re almost entirely impossible to find at any brick and mortar book shops here), so maybe the publisher thought the book would sell better if labelled as science fiction? Although it’s a much stranger decision to me that it wasn’t labelled as science fiction in the UK. It’s very much a science fiction thriller. Perhaps SF doesn’t sell well there?
“Perdition awaits at the end of a road constructed entirely from good intentions, the devil emerges from the details and hell abides in the small print.”
This is the perviest Banks novel I have ever read. Like a late Heinlein romp, all of the women are gorgeous, their bodies described in detail, and they all want to fuck the protagonist. There’s one scene where minds are transferred from body to body to body so that a couple can orgasm over and over and over again until the experience crosses from heightened pleasure into torture. Just like Aaron Sorkin has his characters continually walking-and-talking, if the characters in Transition are dropping some exposition in dialogue, they’re fucking-and-talking, talking and then fucking, fucking and then talking and then fucking some more...and then talking about fucking. There are endless double entendres and sexual puns. It’s all just exhausting, extremely transparent and ridiculous. There’s also a lot of sexual assault in this book, an inclusion I’m not entirely opposed to if its inclusion is in service of the story and is handled well. Here it’s just uncomfortable, lazy, and almost entirely unnecessary.

Come to think of it, there’s a lot in this book that is unnecessary. You could say it’s more of a maximalist short story than a novel, padded out to 400 some odd pages with so much cruft. That would be one way to look at it. Another way is that almost nothing actually happens. It sort of fizzles and pops at the end as well. This is all sounding very negative, I still truly enjoyed the book, but I’m finding it difficult to explain exactly why. The concept of an organization that borders on cultish behavior, established to serve the betterment of humanity, with agents who are able to transfer their minds into parallel universes to achieve their ends is just fantastic fun. Also, Banks’ prose is just unbelievably expressive at times; the kind of mood he’s able to create with words is occasionally breathtaking. I am beyond biased when it comes to this author, but if you’ve read anything else I’ve written about him or his writing, you already knew that.
“Apparently I am what is known as an Unreliable Narrator, though of course if you believe everything you're told you deserve whatever you get.”
There’s an interesting story in Transition, we just never really get a glimpse at it. Instead we get stories that butt up against that story, bouncing off and spiraling around it, only ever hinting at the more interesting narrative. There are also these little narratively conflicting moments spread throughout the book, and while they seem intentional (we are dealing with infinite worlds and infinite versions of the characters as a story device after all) they don't lead anywhere, and only serve to obfuscate and confuse. I don’t think he quite pulled off what he was going for with their inclusion. There are a lot of loose ends, and it feels like we’re maybe only getting about half of the story in that oh-so-clever, postmodern kind of way that can come across as pretentious if handled poorly.Transition was close to what it could’ve been, but it just wasn’t quite there. I think that sums it up pretty well. Massively ambitious, but he didn’t pull it off, not quite. I would’ve loved to see some more stories in this universe though. They could’ve been incredible in the same way that Consider Phlebas only ever hinted at how great the Culture novels would eventually become in the fully realized Use of Weapons, Excession, or Look to Windward.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6436659-transition

Now the lessons she learned in that trial by fire are about to pay off: because this time, the war has come to her. To be exact, someone unknown has launched a full-throttle offensive against Vatta Transport Ltd., Ky’s father’s interstellar shipping empire. In short order, most of Ky’s family is killed, and subsequent attacks sever vital lines of communication, leaving Ky fighting, in every sense, to survive.Determined to identify the ruthless mystery enemy and avenge her family’s name, Ky needs not only firepower but information. And she gets both in spades–from the band of stranded mercenaries she hooks up with, from her black-sheep cousin, Stella, who’s been leading a secret life, and from Stella’s roguish ex-lover, Rafe. Together they struggle to penetrate the tangled web of political intrigue that’s wreaking havoc within InterStellar Communications, whose effective operation their own livelihoods–and perhaps lives–depend on.But the infighting proves to be infectious, and it isn’t long before Ky’s hired military muscle are turning their suspicions on the enigmatic Rafe, whose wealth of knowledge about ISC’s clashing factions and startling new technologies has begun to make him smell like a rat . . . or a mole. With swift, violent destruction a very real possibility, the last thing Ky needs is a crew divided against itself–and she’s prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that Vatta stays in business, as well as in one piece.What she’s not prepared for is the shocking truth behind the terror– and a confrontation with murderous treachery from a source as unexpected as it is unrelenting.From the Hardcover edition.;This is a very enjoyable book -- assuming you know what you're hungry for. For example, if you want a great continuation of a competence-porn space opera dealing with unexpected reversals (such as the loss of her family's trading empire), assassination attempts, money problems, and the need to do everything possible to fight a war with few resources out in space, then I'd say this would be exactly what the doctor would have ordered.I mean, it has everything a young woman, a trading captain, would want. Handsome spies, mercs in need of work, and action, action, action. :)Get your mind out of the gutter. This isn't that kind of SF. It's better. And slowly, surely, this murderous captain that everyone seems to think is a true greenhorn will build that army she needs.

Now Moon is back and so is her butt-kicking, take-no-prisoners heroine, Kylara Vatta. Once the black-sheep scion of a prosperous merchant family, Kylara now leads a motley space force dedicated to the defeat of a rapacious pirate empire led by the mysterious Gammis Turek. After orchestrating a galaxy-wide failure of the communications network owned and maintained by the powerful ISC corporation, Turek and his marauders strike swiftly and without mercy. First they shatter Vatta Transport. Then they overrun entire star systems, growing stronger and bolder. No one is safe from the pirate fleet. But while they continue to move forward with their diabolical plan, they have made two critical mistakes.Their first mistake was killing Kylara Vatta's family.Their second mistake was leaving her alive.Now Kylara is going to make them pay.


But with a fleet consisting of only three ships including her flagship, the Vanguard, a souped-up merchant cruiser Kylara needs allies, and fast. Because even though she possesses the same coveted communication technology as the enemy, she has nowhere near their numbers or firepower.Meanwhile, as Kylara's cousin Stella tries to bring together the shattered pieces of the family trading empire, new treachery is unfolding at ISC headquarters, where undercover agent Rafael Dunbarger, estranged son of the corporation's CEO, is trying to learn why the damaged network is not being repaired. What he discovers will send shock waves across the galaxy and crashing into Kylara's newly christened Space Defense Force at the worst possible moment.";These books are very solid. They have everything you might want to read if you're looking forward to Space Opera, growing a fleet, some tactics, strategic enhancements, opportunism, and competence porn.This far into the series, her fleet is small but it has some excellent advantages that go beyond smarts. No war can be rightly fought and won without some good old-fashioned luck.No complaints. Very enjoyable. Especially in comparison to more modern Space Opera, this one focuses more on grit than social issues. That might appeal to some readers, so take special note. It's just a fun ride.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96276.Command_Decision

Grad-school dropout Matt Fuller is toiling as a lowly research assistant at MIT when, while measuring subtle quantum forces that relate to time changes in gravity and electromagnetic force, his calibrator turns into a time machine. With a dead-end job and a girlfriend who has left him for another man, Matt has nothing to lose taking a time machine trip himself-or so he thinks.";"**Review may contain some minor spoilers**The Accidental Time Machine came at a right time in my life. No, I am not having any “pre” mid-life crisis (not yet, at least); it’s just that that for the past dozen or so days, I was experiencing some serious reading withdrawal. I would pick up a book thinking that finally I have found the right one, read a couple of chapters, and then with a big sigh, put it back on the shelf. I couldn’t continue even if I found a book interesting. This happened at least 10 times until I picked up “The Accidental Time Machine”.And let me tell you, the only thing that is “accidental” here is that that the book’s hero, Matthew, ""invents"" the time machine accidentally (How else?). Apart from that, nothing that he does from then on could be considered inadvertent. He knew exactly where he was going and when. The machine only travelled into the future. But the time frame increased exponentially with each use, hence providing an intriguing set-up for the novel. One thing that annoys me whenever I read a time-travel story (no, the paradoxes don't deter me, or I shouldn't be reading this sort of book in the first place) is that that the characters generally behave rashly without contemplating whether they would survive time travelling. Just jump in and press the button! It’s surprising that none of them ever end up with their heads in the present and torso in the past or future. The author’s “science” exempts them from this very probable fate. And that bugs me. Every time. Thankfully, here Matthew does a lot of experiments and calculations (which are very interesting to read) before concluding that he could use the machine to transport himself to the future. In his journey, he comes across a religious dystopia from where a girl named Martha accompanies him on his further journeys. They travel much farther into the future to a utopia maintained by an AI. Understandably, the AI is bored of the utopia (utopias are always boring) and wants to accompany them on their future exploits, but not without its own ulterior motives.Matthew and Martha want to go back to their own respective times, but in order to do that, they have to travel to a future earth which might have made enough technological advances which might help them to travel to their original pasts (as I said earlier, his machine only travelled into the future).I won’t tell what exactly happens and ruin it for you, but I could at least say that this book is well-written, extremely funny at times, and raises a lot of questions about humanity living in various (advanced or backward) stages of civilization.  The reviews for this book here are all over the place and the average rating is a bit lower than other well loved time-travel books, but in my opinion, that does not reflect the true difference of quality between “The Accidental Time Machine” and other more popular books like To Say Nothing of the Dog, Time and Again and The Anubis Gates. This book deserves as much appreciation as the other well-known books of the genre are getting. Even more, in some cases.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21608.The_Accidental_Time_Machine

When his mother dies in a flitter crash, eighteen-year-old Ishmael Horatio Wang must find a job with the planet company or leave the system--and NerisCo isn't hiring. With credits running low, and prospects limited, he has just one hope...to enlist for two years with a deep space commercial freighter. Ishmael, who only rarely visited the Neris Orbital, and has never been off-planet alone before, finds himself part of an eclectic crew sailing a deep space leviathan between the stars. Join the crew of the SC Lois McKendrick, a Manchester built clipper as she sets solar sails in search of profit for her company and a crew each entitled to a share equal to their rating.";"This morning, Saturday, I got up, made coffee in a travel mug, then dressed and walked to the train station, catching the 8.33 service to Birmingham New Street for a pleasant day of shopping in preparation for an upcoming holiday. Whilst on the train, I was annoyed that I'd forgotten to put sugar in my coffee, but pleased that I managed to get a seat with a table.So, ""stuff"" did happen to me this morning, but nothing which could be considered a ""plot"". And so it is with Nathan Lowell's Quarter Share - its narrative arc is shallow enough to be invisible to all but the most sensitive literary radars. Our story opens with Ishmael Horatio Wang, the protagonist, in his late teens and about to start university, living on Neris, a ""Company Planet"". On page one his only relative dies and within a handful more pages Wang signs up as a galley steward on a space freighter.And that's it. Really - THAT'S IT. He makes coffee, helps the chef, and studies for exams to improve his rating onboard. Hipster space zombies do not attack, the cargo container in Hold 3 does not contain a time machine and the forced intimacies of close-quarter living do not reveal greater truths about the human condition.This then is very much a novel of the mundane (still can't believe I forgot the sugar - was I THAT hungover?), populated by a cast of stock characters - the enigmatic Captain, the gruff but ultimately warm senior noncom etc, etc. The World Building is competent, though as this is essentially the US Merchant Fleet in space, there's not a vast amount to do.A few chapters in, I thought I'd cracked the case - it's a God Squad book - good wholesome entertainment for those who demand their fiction sans cussing or bedroom gymnastics, but no, a cursory Google deep-sixed that theory.In the final third, Quarter Share's mundanity reaches new levels of Magnolia with endless discussions about the rental of trestle tables for a flea market booth but, and here's the thing - I KEPT READING. Why? I have no idea, except the dawning realisation that, as I read Quarter Share, the novel had spun a cocoon of multi-layered bubble wrap around me that I'm mildly ashamed to say I quite, you now, LIKED - it's just a calm, even, decent novel which puts Tab A into Slot B and cruises along until the last page.So, I can't bring myself to stick a cheap, tawdry, critic's shiv into this one - there's an essential humanity and warmth to its world view - decent people, getting along, and doing the right thing by each other. I'm amazed this has spun out into a multi-part series but hey, it takes all sorts.Thrusting, libertarian types always like to distill human expansion, conquest and ambition back to the first stone-age-cave-woman-man-person who raised her/his eyes to the hill on the horizon and thought ""I wonder what's on the other side of that?"" Well, Quarter Share is arguably a novel which raised its eyes to the same hill and instead thought ""I quite like it here"".";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2334538.Quarter_Share

Plus I was appalled by the rhetoric tricks coming out of a skeptical movement; no better than fundamentalists. Most Christians can reconcile science and faith; they’re not antithetical.

Passage;Connie Willis;2001;2000;780;3.72;9770;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Mystery'];A tunnel, a light, a door. And beyond it ... the unimaginable.Dr. Joanna Lander is a psychologist specializing in near-death experiences. She is about to get help from a new doctor with the power to give her the chance to get as close to death as anyone can.A brilliant young neurologist, Dr. Richard Wright, has come up with a way to manufacture the near-death experience using a psychoactive drug. Joanna’s first NDE is as fascinating as she imagined — so astounding that she knows she must go back, if only to find out why that place is so hauntingly familiar.But each time Joanna goes under, her sense of dread begins to grow, because part of her already knows why the experience is so familiar, and why she has every reason to be afraid.Yet just when Joanna thinks she understands, she’s in for the biggest surprise of all — a shattering scenario that will keep you feverishly reading until the final climactic page.;"This book is kind of a beautiful mess. I can think of few other authors with the equal ability to drive me absolutely insane and keep me reading, usually with a lump in my throat. This is my third Connie Willis novel. To Say Nothing of the Dog is one of my favorite books of all time, a comedic farce wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a sci-fi novel. It is probably too long and a lot of the plot relies on misunderstandings, miscommunication, missed connections and narrative dead ends. Doomsday Book is... not one of my favorite books of all time, a tragedy wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a sci-fi novel and haphazardly glued to a comedic farce-turned-maudlin. It is definitely too long.Passage. Passage is a... something. It has elements of comedy, but it isn't nearly as humorous as To Say Nothing of the Dog. It is certainly tragic, but hardly the bleak death march of Doomsday Book. It is arguably sci-fi, but we're dealing with a fairly plausible (on its own terms, at least) medical exploration rather than, you know, time travel. It is also definitely too long.But damn, all those pages pack a punch. Not that there couldn't be about a third fewer of them.You know this if you have read Connie Willis before, but she has an... unusual way of telling stories. Basically, she plops us right into her characters brains, and give us access to their every thought. Then she gives them a mystery to solve. Instead of watching someone gather clues and track down a solution, we get to hear them endlessly natter on about what the solution might be, but no, it probably isn't, but maybe if oh, but no. Sometimes, the character will search for hundreds of pages for a particular piece of evidence, thinking it might hold the solution to the whole shebang. But it doesn't. And almost always, that part could just be clipped right out, still leaving you with an entirely respectable 500-page novel. Other times, the character is on the right track, if she could just manage to call a key person and not get a busy signal, answering machine, or unhelpful secretary.This undeniably irritating ""style"" worked for me in TSNotD and irked me to no end in Doomsday Book (which definitely mashed the ""phones are wacky and unpredictable!"" button into oblivion). In Passage, it... still kind of bugged me, but when you are unraveling the biggest mystery of all, I guess you are going to have to expect some wheel-spinning. Though it probably didn't need to be in the form of endless descriptions of the maze-like interior of a hospital constantly under construction, or the repeated ramblings of a WWII veteran, or people constantly complaining about a cafeteria that is never open. I mean, it's all lightly amusing, and filled with colorful supporting players, but good grief. Is there an editor in the house?But as I said, some of that is to be expected (and at least some of it turns out to be thematically relevant). Because the mystery Connie Willis is taking on here is death. Technically, near-death experiences -- what they are, what they mean. But really, it's death. The big question that no one will ever answer. Willis certainly doesn't, not even in nearly 800 pages, but she gets so, so close to figuring out what death feels like, or what we imagine it will feel like, or want to hope for. Both for the dying and those who must go on living afterward. Somehow, she accomplishes this while offering several Wikipedia pages worth of detail on brain chemistry, famous last words, and the sinking of the Titanic. The Titanic. There's a subject that probably doesn't need another book, and yet it's still a fascinating, harrowing tragedy, meaningful in its meaninglessness, and the perfect centerpiece for a book about the struggle with mortality (no, I'm not going to explain how it fits into the plot). ""The perfect metaphor, looming up suddenly out of nowhere in the middle of your maiden voyage, unseen until it is nearly upon you, unavoidable even when you try to swerve, unexpected even though there have been warnings all along."" As it is with icebergs, so too is it with car crashes and murders and heart attacks and cancer: if only things had happened a little differently, disaster may have been averted. But only for a little while. Every ship eventually sinks.But hopefully not today.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24984.Passage

Ringworld's Children;Larry Niven;2004;2000;284;3.77;9276;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space'];"Welcome to a world like no other.The Ringworld: a landmark engineering achievement, a flat band 3 million times the surface area of Earth, encircling a distant star. Home to trillions of inhabitants, not all of which are human, and host to amazing technological wonders, the Ringworld is unique in all of the universe.Explorer Louis Wu, an Earth-born human who was part of the first expedition to Ringworld, becomes enmeshed in interplanetary and interspecies intrigue as war, and a powerful new weapon, threaten to tear the Ringworld apart forever. Now, the future of Ringworld lies in the actions of its children: Tunesmith, the Ghoul protector; Acolyte, the exiled son of Speaker-to-Animals, and Wembleth, a strange Ringworld native with a mysterious past. All must play a dangerous game in order to save Ringworld's population, and the stability of Ringworld itself.Blending awe-inspiring science with non-stop action and fun, Ringworld's Children, the fourth installment of the multiple award-winning saga, is the perfect introduction for readers new to this New York Times bestselling series, and long-time fans of Larry Niven's Ringworld.";I totally loved this return to Ringworld, the mysterious artificial world that has the surface area of a million Earths and populated by hundreds of hominid species that have evolved there from human ancestors placed there a half-million years earlier. Since its discovery Ringworld has been the target of multiple alien species now engaged in warfare to gain access to its technology (the “Fringe War”). Destroying the functionality of the Ringworld and thereby killing its inhabitants is one solution to reach that goal. This tale, 4th in the series, is concerned with the efforts of a multispecies group to head off such a disaster. I found the characters wonderful, the technologies marvelous, and the plot filled with exciting puzzles and thrilling action. The kind of escapist literature that also expands my mind's horizons. Our hero Louis Wu, an Earth-born human, wakes up from nanotech treatment in an advanced auto-doc to find his two-hundred plus year old body now that of a twenty year-old. He learns he is still an effective slave of Tunesmith, an incredibly advanced creature known as a Protector who has taken charge of the vast Ringworld defense and repair facilities. His value to Tunesmith lies in his knowledge of the species involved in the Fringe War. He doesn’t mind helping out a good cause, but Tunesmith is just so brilliant and goal directed he is dangerous. Any means to an end will do, and if he needs Louis to be smarter and more dedicated, he could give him tree-of-life root, which will turn him into a Protector too. As some readers may have first learned from Niven’s 1974 book “Protector”, the transformation to a bulked-up smart beastie is just a missing phase in hominid development beyond the “breeder” stage, a stage when any family at hand elicits psychotically extreme efforts to protect them. Soon Louis gets tasked to help manage the repair of a big hole in Ringworld created by an antimatter attack, along with his alien friends also put into Tunesmith’s service, the Puppteer Hindmost (two-headed, anxiety prone creatures resembling an ostrich), an adolescent Kzin (cat-like creatures obsessed with macho), and a Protector-phase local hominid apprenticed to Tunesmith. You may have noticed that all of the species reflect psychological extremes found among humans, features that bring both strengths and weaknesses. That’s part of the fun for me in the story.They encounter some folks from away, a potentially hostile crew from the human military security division ARM. Among them is a female Sergeant who takes Louis’ fancy (facilitated by her being the only other human woman on the vast Ringworld and Louis lack of fulfillment with interspecies sex in recent years). Just when Louis begins to feel happy being human again, he gets captured by another super being, an advanced hominid female who claims to be descended from the Ringworld builders. Despite many reasons to be enemies with each other, they all get motivated to work together to help save Ringworld and its inhabitants. Each emergency leads Tunesmith to devise new technologies and bold strategies for the team. That’s the other part of the fun for me in this book. Since the four books in the series came out about one a decade, Niven took the effort to make the novels capable of standing alone. I look forward to the fifth in this series, “Fate of Worlds: Return from the Ringworld”, which is also the keystone to the four prequels to Ringworld which I am just finishing up. This has been a surprisingly rich harvest, given that the original Ringworld novel was somewhat disappointing as a gee-whiz tale about a proverbial “Big Dumb Object” or technology wonder. Ultimately it provided a playground for Niven to bring all of his wonderful species together in a big multifaceted adventure. At its core the work stands out for a hopeful outlook for humans in a distant future of imagination, which contrasts much with the desperation in the apocalyptic tales of the near future that dominate sci fi these days.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64466.Ringworld_s_Children

The long-awaited event stirs up romance and intrigue among his eccentric family and friends, particularly for bioengineered space mercenary Sergeant Taura and shy, diffident Armsman Roic. But Miles also has an enemy who is plotting to turn the romantic ceremony into a festival of death.

As bleak as my personal life has been as of late, as overcast and rainy with the rivers flooding our streets and highways, and as terrible as our Congress's vote against the healthcare my family counts on was today, just getting to read about Taura from the guardsman in Vorkosigan House Roic's POV, brought some joy and amusement back in my heart. Is the story perfect? No, but it sure packs a punch in its little package.

This whole book is from his perspective and is at New Years' festival, Miles wedding and a ton of guests for the occasion. Being security he is kept busy, but one of his main jobs, personally prescribed by Miles, is to escort Sargent Taura around and try to make her time enjoyable. This mostly means that he has to keep the exceedingly phobic toward genetically modified individuals Barrayarans away from her, so they don't hurt her feelings... Taura is a soul with which everyone can fall in love with, but stuffed in a body of a genetically engineered wolf-human hybrid meant to be the perfect solder, running on very fast metabolism, which shortens her life span to the early twenties... She knows this, she knows her days are numbered, and she still lives to the fullest, no regrets, no missed opportunities to be good, gentle, and embrace every experience as precious!!!! I always say I want to be like Cordelia, Miles's mother, but I also want to be able to cherish every moment the way Taura does! And I wish all of us had her gentle nature and capacity for all sides of life the way she does...

Admiral Ky Vatta’s family was decimated by one such attack and Turek, the pirate force’s leader, will not escape her vengeance.Ky has a loyal taskforce, but the enemy have three times the ships and the firepower to match. She must offset these advantages with her knowledge of military strategy and her ace: superior ansible technology, facilitating fast and accurate in-space intelligence.The alternative to victory is unthinkable - devastation of interplanetary trading networks on a galaxy-wide scale - and the end of a way of life.;"Genre: Space Opera/Military Sci FiThis is probably the weakest book of the Vatta’s War series, it wrapped everything up all neat and tidy but it took too many short-cuts. Despite the relationship between Gammis Turek (pirate leader) and Lew Parmina (former head of ISC, biggest company in the known universe) being critical to the success of the pirates in earlier books, it’s never explained WHY they were working together, or even that they WERE directly working together. It’s hinted at a lot, but not elucidated. The only motivation we’re given for either’s power grabs (both using extremely despicable means) is a lust for power. I feel cheated. The sub-plots were also somewhat weak. The sub-plot of Toby falling for the teenaged daughter of a pirate was interesting, but the resolution was a cop out – instead of slowly discovering that the dad was a traitor over the course of the book and having that interact with the larger story, everyone simultaneously intuits the fact that he’s a pirate. (Oh, and everyone – political authorities included – condemn this as vehemently as the Vatta’s who have personal cause for a vendetta.) To make matters even more black-and-white, he’s got to be suddenly revealed as an abusive spouse as well. Totally unnecessary vilification, in my opinion. It would have been much more interesting if he was a likeable fellow. The result of this sub-plot is equally incredulous - it doesn’t even cause a stutter in Toby’s romance! Speaking of romance, I found the romance between Rafe and Ky completely unbelievable. Yes, it’s been foreshadowed ever since we met Rafe, however, they both independently decide they’re in love with each other without ever talking after he leaves her 2 books ago! Not believable. Especially when there is a lot of pressure against a relationship, and they’re both deeply busy with other things. Partiality for each other I have no trouble believing. Deciding the other person is the love of your life without any communication what-so-ever is too much for me to swallow. Especially when Moon set up a perfectly reasonable way for them to keep in secret contact; she could’ve developed that plot/relationship over the course of the book in a much more believable and less melodramatic way.It was still a fun book, full of action and adventure and amusement. However it could’ve been so much MORE then it was.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1305912.Victory_Conditions

But by the same token, I truly avoided this particular book because he was so very EXCELLENT in the original Dune.Why fix perfection?Well... here's a good reason to read this book: it supplies us with a wealth of information for the ACTUAL jihad. And while that isn't the main plot for the novel, it was very interesting. The actual plot is broken up into two. The first is an extensive flashback to when Paul was 12 and it gives us the whole build-up to the Baron, Paul's confirmation as heir, and the tragedy of Leto's marriage and the near-war that followed it. The other is all about Count Fenring and an extensive plot involving the Tleilaxu, which is also very interesting on its own because it's COUNT FENRING. The *almost* Kwizatz Haderach. The one that *could* have killed Paul.Of course, I have a slight issue with this book because of a certain plot hole revolving JUST THAT, but I forgive it because I'm getting some COUNT FENRING. Final estimation?It's light reading. As in Dune-lite. It's not nearly as good as the originals but it does explore some rather cool surrounding aspects and that's the real draw, isn't it? It is what it is.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2920001-paul-of-dune

Valor's Choice;Tanya Huff;2000;2000;409;3.99;8670;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Military Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Military Science Fiction'];"In the distant future, humans and several other races have been granted membership in the Confederation - at a price. They must act as soldier/protectors of the far more civilized races who have long since turned away from war... — Staff Sergeant Torin Kerr was a battle-hardened professional. So when she and those in her platoon who'd survived the last deadly encounter with the Others were yanked from a well-deserved leave for what was supposed to be ""easy"" duty as the honor guard for a diplomatic mission to the non-Confederation world of the Silsviss, she was ready for anything.At first it seemed that all she'd have to contend with was bored troops getting into mischief, and breaking in the new Second Lieutenant who had been given command of her men.Sure, there'd been rumors of the Others - the sworn enemies of the Confederation - being spotted in this sector of space. But there were always rumors. The key thing was to recruit the Silsviss into the Confederation before the Others either attacked or claimed this lizardlike race of warriors for their own side. And everything seemed to be going perfectly. Maybe too perfectly...";Military Space Opera written by a woman who really knows what she's writing about. Marvelous characters and alien races, extremely snappy dialogue, an endearing and tough heroine, and lots of fast action. Torin Kerr is one of my favorite main characters ever written, and I am a particular fan of this book (the first in the series) because it opens with a post sex pheromone hangover and ends with a battle based one of the early moments in the Zulu War (late 1870s). Please, don't make the mistake of comparing Tanya Huff's different series to one another. She completely changes her author voice depending on the genre. A truly remarkable ability in an author. The tone of Valor is entirely different from that of her UF stuff (Blood and Keeper) and both in turn different from her fantasies (Quarter). SO if you have read Tanya before and not liked her, I suggest giving Valor's Choice a try.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/772606.Valor_s_Choice
WWW: Wake;Robert J. Sawyer;2009;2000;354;3.82;8286;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Cyberpunk', 'Canada', 'Fantasy'];Caitlin Decter is young, pretty, feisty, a genius at math, and blind. When she receives an implant to restore her sight, instead of seeing reality she perceives the landscape of the World Wide Web-where she makes contact with a mysterious consciousness existing only in cyberspace.;I loathed this book. Its Hugo nomination makes me cringe. This morning I came out of my room with a happy Labrador bouncing around my feet and the sunshine pouring in, and my roommate said, “good morning!” and I said, “I hate this book.”A congenitally blind teenager is fitted with a neural implant to restore her sight, but first it lets her see the internet, where something is coming alive.There are a lot of things wrong with this book: cardboard writing, pacing issues, characterization of a teenaged girl so off-key it was painful, including Livejournal entries that were so tone deaf it was embarrassing. But that’s not the point here.This book got off on the wrong foot with me before it even started. The acknowledgements note a deafblind man who touched the author’s life. Because, as we all know, the value of people with disabilities is measured by their ability to inspire able-bodied people to flights of limping philosophy about what it all means. Obviously.Things did improve for a while. Sawyer clearly did a certain amount of research about practicalities – his blind protagonist uses Jaws and keyboard commands, has a USB Braille display, etc. It’s funny how your expectations become more demanding when someone puts out the minimum effort. If Sawyer had written some helpless, computer illiterate blind girl, I would have dropped the book, called him a couple uncomplimentary things, and forgotten about it within the week. But since he did do the bare minimum, all of the ways he failed become way more important. A nitpicky example: protagonist is IMing at one point. Her friend says “see you later” and protag thinks that she probably actually wrote “c u,” but she can’t tell the difference. Er, no. “See you” and “c u” are absolutely distinguishable auditorially – I’m listening to the difference right now, and it’s huge. That sort of fail where the book has a surface layer of proper technology, but absolutely no experiential depth to it.And then we really swung into things. Let me summarize:Book: *projects piles of able-bodied bullshit onto blind protagonist, who obviously wants to be cured because that’s what disabled people want, and who thinks about everything she’s missing all the time even though she’s been blind since birth and vision is frankly irrelevant to her sensory experiences at this point*Me: *sigh*Book: *all she really wants is to know what “beautiful” means*Me: I’m blind and I know what beautiful means and I have been moved by beauty fuck you.Book: *extended passages of awful writing from the point of view of an emerging intelligence*Me: *rubs temples* *perseveres*Book: *protag has only one disabled figure to relate to, and absolutely no connection to blind culture or history. Because Helen Keller is who idiot able-bodied authors can be bothered to Google.*Me: *pours a drink*Book: *focuses on language in that obnoxious wink wink way able-bodied people do when they think they’re being “sensitive” and they’re actually just being ablest assholes. E.g. “She wasn’t blind, so to speak, to the implications of what she was reading.*Me: *bangs head gently into wall for a while*Book: *random incident of sexual assault so that the protag can tell teenaged boy that she doesn’t have to see to be able to see right through him. The point eventually emerges that the boy has ruined his chances of scoring with the protag, not that, oh wait, that was sexual assault.*Me: *weeps quietly*Book: *Has a character explain how autism is nothing to be ashamed of, even though they have kept it a secret in this family and never talk about it and she can’t even bring herself to say the word.*Me: *numb acceptance*Book: *a doctor explains to protag that she’s lucky to have been blind because her gifts with math could have come with inherited autism, but hey maybe they did and her blindness . . . cured her? Because autism is about not making eye contact seriously I don’t even fucking know anymore. The phrase “dodged a bullet” was used. Because that’s not an ablest metaphor for disability.*Me: *emits wounded vowel sounds, emails a blind autistic acquaintance and says “fuck!” a lot*Book: *cutesy anecdote about how blind girl didn’t know white people aren’t actually “white.”*Me: Yes she did. Being a sentient human being over the age of eight who can fucking read. She also knew there were green apples as well as red, having gone to fucking preschool.I could go on. More than I already have, I mean.….Don’t lie, you missed me, really.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4418395-www
Time's Eye;Arthur C. Clarke;2003;2000;379;3.72;8280;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Alternate History'];In an instant, Earth is carved up and reassembled like a huge jigsaw puzzle. Suddenly the planet and every living thing on it no longer exist in a single timeline. Instead, the world becomes a patchwork of eras, from prehistory to 2037, each with its own indigenous inhabitants.Scattered across the planet are floating silver orbs impervious to all weapons and impossible to communicate with. Are these technologically advanced devices responsible for creating and sustaining the rifts in time? Are they cameras through which inscrutable alien eyes are watching? Or are they something stranger and more terrifying still?The answer may lie in the ancient city of Babylon, where two groups of refugees from 2037: three cosmonauts returning to Earth from the International Space Station, and three United Nations peacekeepers on a mission in Afghanistan have detected radio signals: the only such signals on the planet, apart from their own. The peacekeepers find allies in nineteenth-century British troops and in the armies of Alexander the Great. The astronauts, crash-landed in the steppes of Asia, join forces with the Mongol horde led by Genghis Khan. The two sides set out for Babylon, each determined to win the race for knowledge . . . and the power that lies within.Yet the real power is beyond human control, perhaps even human understanding. As two great armies face off before the gates of Babylon, it watches, waiting. . . .;Dear Sir Arthur C. Clarke,As a Poul Anderson fan, I enjoyed your collaborative novel Time’s Eye with Stephen Baxter. Not that Anderson has a monopoly on time travel / alternate history books and ideas, but some of his strongest works are in this sub-genre. This one reminded me of Anderson’s The Dancer From Atlantis, and it was also reminiscent of Philip Jose Farmer’s To Your Scattered Bodies Go, with the eclectic blend of historic folks from divergent times. I also enjoyed the references to your wonderful books Childhood's End and 2001: A Space Odyssey. There were also mysterious elements of your award winning work Rendezvous with Rama.Bravo!You are a literary icon, a legend in your genre, one of the “Big Three” with Asimov and Heinlein. You’re a Knight and I’m just a little dude in the relative backwater of Tennessee.But I have a question, Sir Arthur:Who can I blame?Was it you, great though you are, getting a little long in the tooth, maybe slipping a little, and who could blame you? You were 90 when you passed on, still working, still contributing creatively and being productive! Wow!Bravo!But really, who can I throw this rock at, you or Baxter? If it was him, just say, maybe just a shrug, quick nod, I’ll understand.Who was responsible for the raging discontinuity, the loose ends, and the unfulfilled promise of a great idea?My thought about this “collaboration” was that Baxter did all the heavy lifting and you chimed in from Sri Lanka, directing the excavation and supervised the project. Can we blame Baxter or did you the aging Jedi lead your Padawan astray?This could have been great, might have been, perhaps should have been, but over here in the States we play a game called baseball, and when you’re calling balls and strikes you call ‘em like you see ‘em, and this was not great, it was just OK.Still like you a lot, and I’m sure on any other project Mr. Baxter is a damn fine writer and collaborator. No hard feelings.Love,Lyn;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64936.Time_s_Eye
The Telling;Ursula K. Le Guin;2000;2000;231;3.97;8248;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Queer', 'Dystopia'];Once a culturally rich world, the planet Aka has been utterly transformed by technology. Records of the past have been destroyed, and citizens are strictly monitored. But an official observer from Earth named Sutty has learned of a group of outcasts who live in the wilderness. They still believe in the ancient ways and still practice its lost religion - the Telling.Intrigued by their beliefs, Sutty joins them on a sacred pilgrimage into the mountains...and into the dangerous terrain of her own heart, mind, and soul.;Ursula K. LeGuin returns to her Hainsih cycle in The Telling but begins on dear old Terra.First published in 2000, The Telling has as LeGuin’s outside-looking-in observer / narrator the Ekumen trained Sutty. In LeGuin’s Hainish universe, the Ekumen is an alliance of like-minded worlds who seek to re-unite humanity form the galaxy wide and eons old diaspora of the original Hain colonizers. LeGuin first wrote about the Hain as the original source of humanity. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, people left Hain and went out to populate other solar systems and planets, our Terra being one. That old Hainish culture collapsed and all of the colonies eventually “forgot” from where they had come. A later Hainish civilization has returned to space and finds its offspring changed to meet local adaptive needs and many of the branches off the old tree have evolved separately.This concept is both a fun series for science fiction / fantasy as well as a vehicle by which LeGuin can explore allegorical sociological concepts. In The Telling, the protagonist Sutty is an Ekumen observer, and through her LeGuin can take the reader on a metaphorical examination of a different culture that has roots in our own meta group dynamics.Sutty has left an Earth that is ravaged by geo-political and theological conflict and goes to serve as a kind of ambassador to Aka, a world that has only recently been “re-discovered” by the Hain. Akan society has demonstratively and aggressively shrugged off her old ways and cultures, literally burning the history books, as they seek to catch up to Hain in a single generation. Sutty and LeGuin observe the conflicts this rapid modernization has engendered in the people of both the old ways and the new.From Wikipedia: “Le Guin constructed the recent historical situation of Aka as a parallel to the history of China during the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. The practice of the Telling is analogous to Taoist practices, and its suppression to the suppression of religious practices by the Chinese government at the time.”I have yet to find an Ursula K. LeGuin book that I did not like. The Telling is a fair representative of her fine work, blending a literary virtuosity with fresh ideas and with a significant social message.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59921.The_Telling
Saturn's Children;Charles Stross;2008;2000;336;3.59;7936;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Cyberpunk', 'Robots', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Space'];Following the extinction of humankind in the twenty-third century, leaving behind only androids, femmebot Freya Nakamichi 47 accepts a job to transport a mysterious package from Mercury to Mars, unaware that some extremely powerful and ruthless humanoids will stop at nothing to possess the package and its contents.;"This book goes down a lot better if you realize that Charles Stross was taking the piss out of Heinlein. (I love that phrase, even if I'm not British.)Specifically, it's a semi-satirical rewrite of Friday.Friday is one of my most hated favorite Heinleins. It was a fantastic story with a cool character in an action-packed sci-fi universe, and it showcased everything about Heinlein that has him rather out of favor nowadays. Friday, the title character, was a genetically engineered artificial person who was a super-sexy super-spy who spent about half her time doing super-spy stuff and the other half providing fan service to sci-fi nerds who fantasize about a hot nubile young black belt in the art of sexyjutsu who wants to jump their pot-bellied middle-aged bods.So, in Saturn's Children, Freya (get it?) Nakamichi is an android (or ""robot"" as she admits later) concubine. She becomes orgasmic at the thought of being in the presence of a human male. Her problem being that humans are extinct.Stross is basically taking the Heinlein trope and giving it steroids with a rocket. Freya acts very much like Friday, complete with frequent moments of ditziness despite her superhuman intelligence and sexing anything that will hold still long enough. It does not feel as exploitative as Heinlein because you can tell Stross is doing it with a wink, but I wouldn't exactly call it subversive either. More like half-fanfic, half-parody.Freya winds up working as a super-spy for a shadowy boss who sends her on errands around the solar system. In the post-human society built by their creations, robots have managed to recreate the worst aspects of human civilization: wealthy aristos lord it over slaves and the barely-free. But the prospect of a reborn ""creator"" - i.e., a real live human, whom every robot is hardwired to obey - threatens the entire civilization.This was an entertaining space opera with a sexy adventuress who's a lot more entertaining if you realize the author was probably writing this a little bit tongue-in-cheek. There are conspiracies and double-crosses and triple-crosses, lots of humor, and a classic SF feel.There is a sequel, Neptune's Brood, which takes place in the same universe but centuries later (and with different characters).";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2278387.Saturn_s_Children
Seeker;Jack McDevitt;2005;2000;373;3.92;7847;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Speculative Fiction'];The Barnes & Noble ReviewAlex Benedict and his executive assistant, Chase Kolpath -- ambitious antiquities dealers from Jack McDevitt's A Talent for War (1989) and, more recently, Polaris -- are back in Seeker, a story in which the two antiquarians search for a legendary lost colony that is both a science fiction thriller and a remarkably complex mystery.More than 9,000 years after an interstellar transport named Seeker left an overcrowded and politically repressive Earth with the dream of founding a new society on an unspecified planet, Benedict and Kolpath stumble across a ceramic cup that was once on the now-legendary lost starship. But tracking down how the ancient artifact got from the ship into the hands of a maltreated woman and her thuggish boyfriend turns out to be more than Benedict and Kolpath bargained for -- as their search leads them across multiple star systems and straight into an anonymous assassin's crosshairs. But as the killer closes in, the two courageous antiquarians uncover the jaw-dropping truth about the lost starship and the legendary colony Equally reminiscent of Frederik Pohl's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Heechee saga (Gateway, Beyond the Blue Event Horizon, et al.) and a classic Ellery Queen mystery, McDevitt's Seeker will appeal to readers of hard-core science fiction, as well as adventurous mystery fans looking for an out-of-this-world story. And just like Polaris, Seeker is characterized by a bombshell of an ending that will leave readers absolutely awestruck. Paul Goat Allen;"It’s somehow difficult to qualify just why I enjoy McDevitt so much. His stories invariably have a long build up. Yet, I always end up enjoying them a lot. Perhaps it’s the big reveal mechanism that he so effectively employs. Perhaps it’s the fact that the Alex Benedict books are so hard to pigeonhole (Is it far future thriller? Is it Hard SF? Is it Space Opera? Is it archaeological mystery in space? Is it all of the above?). Perhaps it’s simply the fact that they feel so comfortable, like a pair of lived in jeans.Suffice to say, I do enjoy these books. Seeker, in particular, is one of my favourites. Nobody is likely to draw any comparison between Alex Benedict and Indiana Jones (he pretty much leaves all the manly action type stuff to his female sidekick), but these books do have a strong archeological bent, albeit on a vastly grander scale. In this particular instance the search is on for a mythical colony ship (the Seeker of the title) which disappeared 9,000 years previously, with colonists and all. It turns out that the future history that McDevitt has created is well suited to this kind of mystery, and I daresay these books would possibly even appeal to readers of contemporary mysteries who wouldn’t typically indulge in Science Fiction. That’s not to say that the science in here is soft, it just takes a bit of a back seat to the story, with one spectacular exception that I can’t mention here (spoiler territory).There is more than a little intrigue as the story unfolds. McDevitt doesn’t hurry proceedings; he just lets it happen. Don’t let that fool you though, when excitement does strike it packs quite a punch. And, when the reveal finally comes, reminiscent of the best of Poirot and Holmes, you can’t help but feel awe at his vision. It could just be that McDevitt owns this corner of the Science Fiction market; I’m not aware of any other authors who regularly write the same kind of thing, but feel free to educate me in the comments field below.In the end the book is just a whole lot of fun, with some “gosh-wow!” moments, especially at the grand finale. It just goes to show how a good story can transcend any genre.Seeker won the Nebula award for best novel in 2006. It was also nominated for the John W. Campbell award.Additional InformationIf Xeno-Archaeology is more your thing, McDevitt’s Academy / Priscilla Hutchins series is worth investigating.

Academic and insightful, its dominion stretches from Earth Central into the unfathomable reaches of the galactic void. But when the Polity finally encounters alien life in the form of massive, hostile, crab-like carnivores known as the Prador, there can be only one outcome — total warfare! Starships clash, planets fall, and space stations are overrun, but for Jebel Krong and Moria Salem, two unlikely heroes trapped at the center of the action, this war is far more than a mere clash of cultures, far more than technology versus brute force... this war is personal.;Very readable and extremely quick-paced action adventure with buggy aliens vs AI-enhanced humanity in some distant future.Sound familiar? Well, yeah, it is. But still! Lots of modern concepts thrown in, from virtual realities, fake-matter pocket universes, and bio-enhanced pheromone-enslaved monstrous race of aliens. Add elements, mix well, and let the fur fly!Seriously, I've read much worse and the quality *is* pretty top notch. There's even a few easter eggs for you peeps who want a little poetry or introversion with your pew pew action.All in all, it's pure popcorn, from the peace delegation to the rending of limbs at same, to the dire fates of whole worlds and their humans and AIs. Oh yeah, and humans never really get their shit together, do they? Sometimes, but it's sooooo easy to subvert them, isn't it?

John Harrison’s dangerously illuminating new novel, three quantum outlaws face a universe of their own creation, a universe where you make up the rules as you go along and break them just as fast, where there’s only one thing more mysterious than darkness.In contemporary London, Michael Kearney is a serial killer on the run from the entity that drives him to kill. He is seeking escape in a future that doesn’t yet exist—a quantum world that he and his physicist partner hope to access through a breach of time and space itself. In this future, Seria Mau Genlicher has already sacrificed her body to merge into the systems of her starship, the White Cat. But the “inhuman” K-ship captain has gone rogue, pirating the galaxy while playing cat and mouse with the authorities who made her what she is. In this future, Ed Chianese, a drifter and adventurer, has ridden dynaflow ships, run old alien mazes, surfed stellar envelopes. He “went deep”—and lived to tell about it. Once crazy for life, he’s now just a twink on New Venusport, addicted to the bizarre alternate realities found in the tanks—and in debt to all the wrong people.Haunting them all through this maze of menace and mystery is the shadowy presence of the Shrander—and three enigmatic clues left on the barren surface of an asteroid under an ocean of light known as the Kefahuchi Tract: a deserted spaceship, a pair of bone dice, and a human skeleton.;"M. John Harrison is under the impression that plot and character can be totally abandoned in favor of a frantic and sloppy exercise in ""cyberpunk"" style.Far future cyberpunk just doesn't work.First of all, the voice of the book is off: some deep future hep cat telling you like it is about quasars, dark matter, and quantum physics, baby, in language so opaque and ""snappy"" that a sense of wonder or even simple coherence is never achieved. If you're going to do cyberpunk, and Harrison is very obviously trying, you need to offer a plausible immersion in a future world. Yes, I know good SF is never really about prediction, but good cyberpunk needs a faithful adherence to an illusion of reality. It can't just be a collage of weirdness for it's own sake, or a collection of hastily slapped together future slang, as this book is. The chosen style, such as it is, is consistently employed, but totally unsuited to the material.You can't set a story 400 years in the future, and then keep coming up with reasons, on practically every page, for the environments to be drenched in ""retro"" detail. We don't read SF to immerse ourselves in a collage of weirdness we already know. Cyberpunk works because of its near-future mode, both strange and familiar, that engages cultural details and patterns of the reader's present and recent past. It requires highly specific descriptions of objects and fashions that have a kind of unfamiliar coherence. Harrison gives us absolutely none of that. He just lists a bunch of random objects and styles without really describing them or making them work together, so the ""weirdness"" just seems relentless, forced, and silly. Sort of like an interminable episode of Dr. Who. The frantic onslaught of detail seems to come from a lack of confidence, a fear that the reader will realize that there is no actual story being told. We never get comfortable with the characters, or see them inhabit a coherent setting long enough for them to change or face challenges. All fiction has to do this to some degree. Even Ulysses by James Joyce does this. Harrison is no Joyce, or even William Gibson, and his readers don't come to his books expecting experimental art. They want SF, and his offering is in bad faith. I can't believe this book is as praised as it is.Harrison's characters just scamper around facile collage landscapes, batted about by a Deus ex machina that, though revealed in the final chapter, has no organic, story-based reason for not being revealed in the very first chapter. There are one or two very conventional SF ideas that are stretched out over an entire, exhausting novel.And all of this is a shame, because the first few chapters of the Michael Kearney section read like a first-rate horror novel. Harrison can obviously write well if he wants, and how he went so wrong is a mystery.I am willing to abandon all of my genre expectations if a book is good enough to sustain itself as a work of art. Stanislaw Lem does this. Thomas M. Disch does this. Harrison does not. William S. Burroughs could get away with a frantic collage of strangeness because his writing is so beautiful that you forget the need for any of the traditional offerings of the novel. Perhaps Harrison thought he could do the same thing, but he was most certainly wrong.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17735.Light

Ian McDonald has written the great Indian novel of the new millennium, in which a war is fought, a love betrayed, a message from a different world decoded, as the great river Ganges flows on.My Review: Ian McDonald. This is a name to conjure with, boys and girls. This is one fearless Irishman. This is a major major talent doing major major things. How dare he, how dare I, warble his praises when he, a white guy from the colonial oppressor state, has the temerity to write a science fiction novel about INDIA?!? There are scads of Indian writers and it's their country! Let *them* write their stories!Codswallop.Read the book. Then come and tell me it should have remained unwritten because of some nonsensical national pride hoo-hah.It's got every damn thing a reader could want: A new gender, the nutes, pronoun “yt;” a wholly new form of energy harvested from other universes; a political scandal-ridden politician who falls for our main nute character, despite his long marriage, and pursues yt desperately; a civil war a-brewin' over water rights in the now fragmented subcontinental political world; aeais (artificial intelligences) that are forbidden by law to exceed the Turing Test that establishes whether an entity is human or human-passable; and, as with any law, the lawbreakers who inevitably arise are hunted by a new breed of law enforcement officers, here called “Krishna cops.” Krishna being the Original God, Supreme Being, One Source in many parts of India, there is some justice to that, one supposes.Recapitulating the plot is pointless. This is a sprawling story, one that takes nine (!) main characters to tell. I felt there were two too many, and would entirely prune Lisa, the American physicist, and Ajmer, the spooky girl who sees the future, because those story lines were pretty much just muddying the waters for me. I thought the physicist on a quest, who then makes a giant discovery, which leads her back to the inventor of the aeais, could easily have been a novel all on its own, one that would fit in this universe that McDonald has summoned into being. I simply didn't care for or about Ajmer.The aeais' parent, Thomas Lull, is hidden away from the world in a dinky South Indian village. Yeah, right! Like the gummints of the world would let that happen! I know why McDonald did this, plot-wise, but it's just not credible to me. He could be demoted from player to bit part and simplify the vastness of the reader's task thereby.So why am I giving this book a perfect score? Because. If you need explanations:--The stories here are marvelously written.“And you make me a target as well,” Bernard hisses. “You don't think. You run in and shout and expect everyone to cheer because you're the hero.”“Bernard, I've always known the only ass you're ultimately interested in is your own, but that is a new low.” But the barb hits and hooks. She loves the action. She loves the dangerous seduction that it all looks like drama, like action movies. Delusion. Life is not drama. The climaxes and plot transitions are coincidence, or conspiracy. The hero can take a fall. The good guys can all die in the final reel. None of us can survive a life of screen drama. “I don't know where else to go,” she confesses weakly. He goes out shortly afterwards. The closing door sends a gust of hot air, stale with sweat and incense, through the rooms. The hanging nets and gauzes billow around the figure curled into a tight foetus. Najia chews at scaly skin on her thumb, wondering if she can do anything right.Krishan barely feels the rain. More than anything he wants to take Parvati away from this dying garden, out the doors down on to the street and never look back. But he cannot accept what he is being given. He is a small suburban gardener working from a room in his parents' house with a little three-wheeler van and a box of tools, who one day took a call from a beautiful woman who lived in a tower to build her a garden in the sky.Some of my favorite passages I can't put here, because they contain some of the many, many words and concepts that one needs—and I do mean needs—the glossary in the back of the book to fully appreciate. The concept of the book is breathtaking. Westerners don't usually see India as anything other than The Exotic Backdrop. McDonald sees the ethnic and religious tensions that India contains, barely, as we look at her half-century of independence ten years on (review written 2007) and contemplate the results of the Partition. He also sees the astounding and increasing vigor of the Indian economy, its complete willingness to embrace and employ any and all new ideas and techniques and leverage the staggeringly immense pool of talent the country possesses. McDonald also extrapolates the rather quiet but very real and strong trend towards India as a medical tourism destination: First-world trained doctors offering third-world priced medical care. This is the genesis of the nutes, people who voluntarily have all external gender indicators and all forms of gender identification surgically removed, their neural pathways rewired, and their social identities completely reinvented.Think about that for a minute.If your jaw isn't on the floor, if your imagination isn't completely boggled, then this book isn't for you and you should not even pick it up in the library to read the flap copy. If you're utterly astonished that an Irish dude from Belfast could winkle this kind of shit up from his depths, if you're so intrigued that you think it will cause you actual physical pain not to dive right in to this amazing book, you're my kind of people.Welcome, soul sibling, India 2047 awaits.

The Chronoliths;Robert Charles Wilson;2001;2000;315;3.68;5473;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Fantasy'];"Scott Warden is a man haunted by the past-and soon to be haunted by the future. In early twenty-first-century Thailand, Scott is an expatriate slacker. Then, one day, he inadvertently witnesses an impossible event: the violent appearance of a 200-foot stone pillar in the forested interior. Its arrival collapses trees for a quarter mile around its base, freezing ice out of the air and emitting a burst of ionizing radiation. It appears to be composed of an exotic form of matter. And the inscription chiseled into it commemorates a military victory--twenty years in the future.Shortly afterwards, another, larger pillar arrives in the center of Bangkok-obliterating the city and killing thousands. Over the next several years, human society is transformed by these mysterious arrivals from, seemingly, our own near future. Who is the warlord ""Kuin"" whose victories they note? Scott wants only to rebuild his life. But some strange loop of causality keeps drawing him in, to the central mystery and a final battle with the future. The Chronoliths is a 2002 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel and the winner of the 2002 John W. Campbell Memorial Award.";In a lot of ways, this is an excellent novel full of well-conceived characters driven by a slowly disintegrating society. Add suddenly appearing strange event/objects, the Chronoliths, and watch our near-future implode.This is not an action-fueled novel. It is family-driven, obliquely and curiously propelled by the inclusion of old colleagues and the slow social collapse of our world. Think Spin, but not with the stars disappearing. Just add big monoliths that suddenly warp space-time, appearing in the middle of jungles or places all over the world, have them commemorate some near-future battle, and see how YOU would do with such knowledge. :)The most important (read best) part of this novel is the worldbuilding. The social interactions, the sideways decline. And the main characters. They managed to make me care. :) Quite interesting. The details are especially fine. :);https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116413.The_Chronoliths
Divergent;Veronica Roth;2011;2010;487;4.14;4076819;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Teen'];In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.;What kind of ridiculous mess...Oh man.So I know I say this in dissenting opinion, as many on my friends list are partial to this book, but I could not stand it. So before I go off on my tirade, I must explain. You may be thinking to yourself why I gave it two stars and not one, if I’m complaining so much. Let me explain that two is pretty low on my scale. Two is “why did I buy this.” Or read this. Or whatever. One star is dramatic. One is “this should not have been written,” which I have given out as you may know. But no, I don’t believe that of Divergent. Roth has an interesting concept. It had potential. But it’s the execution of the idea that was just awful to me.I felt like I could feel what the author was thinking. Regardless of whether or not this is true, this is what I felt the author was saying to me through my copy of Divergent (minorish, and a few obvious spoilers to follow, major spoiler hidden under cut, you’ve been warned):Research? Lol who needs to do that to write a book? No I know how to write a book, okay. I’ve read other books so I know.You know what was a good book? The Hunger Games. I liked Mockingjay as well, so I think I’m going to put them together and write a book just like that. Yea. Okay. Small petite girl, check. Dystopia, check. Living in an underground compound, check. Lessons about bravery and self-sacrifice, check. Small girl trains with other people who are jealous of her success, check. Kills people, check.  Boyfriend gets programmed to hate her and tries to kill her, check. Good. I’ve got all the elements of a good book. I’ve even ended the last chapter with a train. Both The Hunger Games and Harry Potter did that. I’m going to be a YA legend.What’s cool? Jumping on a moving train. What else is cool? Jumping off a roof. Oh yea that sounds cool. I’ve seen that in a movie. Yea. What’s even cooler than that? ZIPLINING. I gotta think of more cool things, hold on. Gimme a second and I’ll come up with another. Omg this book took me a WHOLE month to write. That’s like an eternity. Okay publishing time.I’ve read that she did write it in a month. Whether it’s true or not, I'd certainly believe it in a heartbeat. The whole thing is rushed and just…completely nonsensical and full of trope after trope. It seemed to me that there was little effort put into analyzing the world and zero research done for it, which is a reminder to any of us who are writers to always have a reason for something, and not just because it “sounds cool.” This book is a treasure trove of COOL PEOPLE tropes and activities. Which doesn’t seem to work on me as I really can’t stand that breed of thrill-seeking people who’d rather risk their life doing stupid shit instead of… you know, not. So what is supposed to be super awesomely cool people just, to me, looked like a band of idiots.Before I break it down, let’s get one thing out of the way. Wigs, did you like anything about the book though? Yes. Yes I did. Let’s talk about what did work for me:-Chapters 24 and 25. (lol, yes, out of the 39, I liked those two. She must have written those on a good night.) I feel like they kind of dropped all of the other outside nonsense and kind of focused on just human things. I think there’s a good writer in her, just not when she’s trying to be all dystopian and… cool.-Al’s storyline. And while Tris’s initial responses to Al made me rage, the story arc of Al really did move me emotionally and in a way that I was proud of Roth for doing so. Like cathartically I’m glad I felt these things over it.-Some of her little details were nice touches. I enjoyed this particular one where Four was under a blue spotlight in a dark hallway it she described how his eyes were black and shadowed while the rest of his face eerily lit (or something like that.) Just here and there were some bits of description I liked.And since I can’t think of anything else, let’s just move on. I like how it didn’t take me forever to read, but big font and spacing isn’t really a pro that counts for this.Jeez this is starting to turn into Divergent: The Review, a novel by Wigs. But oh well. You can stop at any time. But I can’t. Not yet. I have to get this out of my head.So here’s what I have issues with. And hey, if in book 2 she fixes some of these issues and answers some of the questions, great. I don’t care. Because someone can tell me “oh but we learn about that in book 2!” all they want but that doesn’t change the fact that after book 1 I’m thinking to myself “well that was completely stupid.” If you can’t convince me from book 1 to keep going then we’ve got a problem, right?So as you already probably know, this book is about this dystopian society that is divided up into five factions, based on personality traits, point being that you are assigned a career/lifestyle based on what you’re like. And that’s fine. I can believe that. I can believe that a dystopian society would force you into choosing a limited amount of careers based on what you excel in. My issue is that this society is completely dysfunctional. And I know that we’re supposed to be on the cusp of collapse and all, but there is a difference between dystopian and dysfunctional. A dystopian is scary for us, because ideally, it is supposed to be believable. We can believe The Hunger Games is possible because people would totally watch a reality show where people fight to the death. If you put that on tv right now, thousands, I’m sure, would watch it. In the case of Divergent, my issue is that this society is unbelievable. I’m not convinced that there was a way society could get to this point, because the details are so minimal and poorly thought out. Everything is very homogenized and simplified thusly into these factions and these careers (using the information given to us):Abnegation (selfless people): healthcare, politicsDauntless (brave people): guards, policeErudite (knowledgeable people): research, reporting (and one would guess teaching?)Amity (friendly people): farmingCandor (honest people): lawyers, and…?Okay so seriously what does Candor even do? 1/5 of this society is lawyers? I don’t think so. I would have thought they would have at least done news/newspapers but we’re told that it comes from Erudite so I don’t even know. They seem pointless. Anything I can think of that might go with them is really better suited to Erudite.And wait a minute. Healthcare is given to Abnegation? Wait really? Shouldn’t it be given to Erudite, since being in the medical field requires almost a decade of studying to learn how to do it? Or what, is it like homeopathic healthcare? How helpful.You CANNOT tell me that one faction rules the government. There is NO WAY that when they set up the system people were like you know what's a good idea? Putting one group in all the power. That's ridiculous to say that something like that happens in Future America. There's no way they wouldn't have put together a system where there is representation from each faction within a council. (Isn't that what the American Revolution was all about? Lack of representation in government? I cannot see everyone saying 'fuck representation! let's all agree to give the government over to the selfless people'....and later being like OH WHOOPS we don't like this!) So the whole main plot of Divergent is based on something that's already broken my suspension of belief.And what’s with everyone being white collar? And how blue collar jobs are for the factionless, which the author speaks of as if they’re on the same level as crazy homeless people. I sorely hope she doesn’t think that in real life. Tris speaks about them as if they’re pariahs. Construction workers, bus drivers, gasp, the horror. The villain wants to get rid of them. Oh yes. Oh yes. Get rid of your laborers, what villain who dreams of prosperity DOESN’T get rid of the laborers? Hahaha Roth you’re killing me.Okay, we need to talk about the train for a second. What. Is with. The Train. Why doesn’t it ever stop? (except for that one time when they rode it to the end of the city.) Why is this train an asshole? Didn’t jump on on time? Oops, you failed. Now you’re homeless. Loser. Oops, you fell off and now you’re dead. Lol we don’t stop the train here, bitch. Learn to live. (For a city that hasn’t seen murders in years, why does nobody give a shit when someone dies falling off the train? If random death isn’t common, why isn’t it horrifying? Why is everyone like just ignore it guys, just ignore it.) If it’s a Dauntless only train, why the fuck doesn’t it actually stop at the Dauntless compound. Oh yea because the Dauntless are stupid and have to make things ~death-defying.~ And how is it that the train tracks are both on the ground in front of the glass building and seven stories up at the roof of the glass building? I guess there’s two sets of tracks even though it wasn’t spoken about like that? Or otherwise the steepest track change in the world, haha.AND WHY DO THEY LIVE UNDERGROUND? WHY? They had perfectly good empty buildings to refurbish, and instead they spend however many millions of dollars digging a bigass hole in the middle of the city just so people can enjoy some nice sunlight-deprived living. OH NO IT’S JUST BECAUSE TRIS NEEDED TO JUMP OFF A ROOF INTO A BLACK HOLE. Yea okay now it all makes sense what a good idea I’m glad you came up with such a normal reason for an underground compound. Not like that they’re in hiding or privacy or anything sensical like that. Or maybe she just wanted to copy Mockingjay, that too, of course. I can’t forget that.You know, all of this could have made sense if she just didn’t make it set in our world. She could have chosen, say, a Miyazaki type world where there’s a magical train that doesn’t stop, and a place where the people all live underground, and whatever. But no, this is freakin’ future Chicago. And guess what people. In the future, the trains stop for no bitch, so watch out.Okay okay I could go on forever about all the stuff I hate but I’m just gonna harp on two more topics and call it quits.1)Why are the Dauntless so ridiculous? One thinks that a dystopian society would care about their military. Especially considering that in this case, their entire city is surrounded by a guarded fence with barbed wire. Clearly protection is important to them. So whyyyyyyy are the Dauntless, the only source of soldiers, completely undisciplined jackasses? They party it up and dress up like punks from 70s London and ….train to fight MMA style for whatever reason (It’s COOL, Wigs, gosh) but why are they completely out of control? They all act like they’re 15. Let’s sneak out at night and go do shit wooooo! Why aren’t the initiates sent immediately to bootcamp style training, like an actual military. Instead we’re gonna capture the flag and you know, camp activities mixed in with boy-on-girl fist-fighting and knife throwing. And mental training which, while cool (there’s that magic word again), seems to serve no real life application aside from the ridiculous circumstances Roth cooks up. You know what? We’re not going to kill you normally. We’re going to put you in a box full of water because we know you think about that in your worst nightmares. We already had this ready too, for whatever reason.2) And how, HOW, HOW is everyone not Divergent? Why does Tris have special snowflake syndrome? We’re told that being divergent is basically having a mind which is suitable for multiple factions, not just one single faction. Which is dangerous etc whatever. And I can buy that, I can, that a dystopian society would want to suppress an individual which has too many skills or whatever butttttt… how is it that SO few people actually have multiple skills. Seeing as things like selflessness and kindness go hand in hand, wouldn’t people be divergent for Abnegation and Amity? And wouldn’t people who speak their mind and are smart, a common pairing, be divergent for Candor and Erudite? And what about the people who’s tests tell them that they belong in one faction, but are allowed to choose another?? Why is that allowed, since it encourages them to learn more skills? (which is discouraged!) If they’re good at their chosen faction, and not the one that they were intended, doesn’t that make them divergent? And if they want to discourage people having multiple functions, why the hell are people allowed to change factions at all? Because if you’re raised one way and then learn a whole new way, aren’t you, in fact, becoming divergent by straddling the two worlds? It’s not like suddenly people forget everything, Christina still has her Candor traits even though she’s in Dauntless. I just don’t understand what seems to be this fatal flaw in Roth’s design. And because of this, I see how sad the wasted potential is. Why ISN’T everyone secretly divergent? Wouldn’t that actually be making a statement on the nature of humans and how you can’t suppress them into single pieces and put them in a box? But no, no, Tris has a special brain. No one can get into her mind. Just like Bella Swan.Speaking of which, with Tris, who is supposed to be divergent for Abnegation and Dauntless, I can barely find any selflessness traits outside of a what any regular person would do. I found her, in fact, written incredibly selfish, as teenagers are. It seemed that Roth didn’t realize (or did she?) what a jerk she was writing Tris to be (omg why are my friends so jealous of me??? Omg he’s so gross but lol someone likes me that’s so cool.) She also has to point out physical features to add to why she doesn't like people (greasy hair, crooked teeth, stretch marks, pudge....didn't you know that all bad people are also ugly? Duh.)Ugh I’m sorry I’m going to stop talking, that is enough, Wigs. Basically it comes down to this. I didn’t buy 90% of the stuff I was being fed. Eye-rolling was induced many a time. The ending was just about every cliché from an action movie I could think of. AND WHY DID YOU KILL WILL? WHY? YOU SHOOT ERIC IN THE FOOT, PETER IN THE ARM, PEOPLE YOU HATE, BUT THEN WILL, ONE OF YOUR ONLY FRIENDS, IN THE HEAD? IT WASN’T EVEN A RAGE KILL. YOU SPECIFICALLY TOLD US YOU AIMED AT HIS HEAD. RIGHT AFTER YOU SAID YOU KNEW IT WASN’T HIS FAULT. RIGHT BEFORE YOU SAID YOU NEEDED TO WAKE UP ALL THE DAUNTLESS AS THEY DIDN’T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. OH YEA THAT’S RIGHT WE NEEDED A KILL-YOUR-FRIEND SCENE. CUZ THAT’S WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE STORIES, RIGHT?I’m sorry. I’m sorry everybody, for being a grump. But I just can’t with this. I can’t. I can’t deal. A book without a solid platform of sense is just not for me.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13335037-divergent
Mockingjay;Suzanne Collins;2010;2010;390;4.09;3325867;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Adventure'];My name is Katniss Everdeen.Why am I not dead?I should be dead.Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans—except Katniss.The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay—no matter what the personal cost.;"SPOILERS AHEAD!!What. the. f***. Words can't begin to express my disappointment. I bought Mockingjay the first day it came out and I was preparing myself for a truly epic novel, one worthy of its predecessors. I loved The Hunger Games; it was fast-paced, thrilling, suspenseful. Catching Fire wasn't as good but it was still enjoyable (I was majorly impressed by the game arena). I wasn't let down by Catching Fire though; I figured it was just a transition novel, build-up to what would undoubtedly be a mindblowing, epic conclusion in Mockingjay. Maybe I set my expectations too high. I do think Collins is a good writer; she definitely knows how to write and tell a story. But I feel like she lost her way in this book. Or maybe the only thing that made this series so great was the Hunger Games, and now that it's absent, there's nothing to drive the story.The love triangle wasn't well played out. First of all, I'm getting a bit tired of reading about love triangles -- especially in novels where there's a much greater plot present. But I'll admit, I was on Team Gale throughout the series, because he was strong and resilient and resourceful and caring. There was this attractive manly quality about him and he was so in sync with Katniss, and hot to boot. But towards the end of this novel, I didn't give a flying fart about Katniss's love life and who she ended up with, because everything seemed like such a hopeless, depressing mess that there was no point. I also hated how she kept flip-flopping and toying with both Gale and Peeta (I've been bothered by this since CF). She should make up her mind about who she wants instead of leading them both on! Her fickleness is pretty inconsiderate to these two guys whom she supposedly cares about. And if she can't decide (I can see why, they both have great qualities), then she should give herself some space/time to decide, and in the meantime, don't go kissing or showing romantic affection to either one! She ended up with Peeta, which would have been fine if it had been executed properly. But even in this aspect of her life, she didn't get to CHOOSE, which is basically the story of her life. She just ended up with Peeta because he was the only one who stuck around. At the end, I found myself wanting her to end up alone, of her OWN choice. Heck, instead of spiraling into bleak depression and continuing life as a puppet, I would have rather seen her die for a noble cause and for doing the right thing. That would have been a more satisfactory ending, and that's saying something because I normally HATE when characters die.I didn't like that we didn't get to experience the action close-up. As the war unraveled, I felt like Katniss was always on the sidelines, only called in when other people commanded her to. We didn't get to see Katniss kicking butt against her enemies, we got to hear from other characters about events that occurred, or watch them on the TV. It is so mindnumbingly dull to be watching a character watching something, instead of experiencing the action with the character. Everything she did was for show, for a propo or campaign or whatever. It was all so .. fake. Here they are in the middle of a war, people are dying left and right, and all they care about is filming and getting good shots and angles and putting on a pretty face! It felt so staged and it was boring and infuriating to read. The only real action is towards the end when she and her team are going on the assassin mission to kill Snow, and even THAT was originally only for a propo (that went astray). The last third of the book (the assassin mission) was gorey and bloody, which I didn't mind. It's war after all. But many characters' deaths were so rushed and pointless. Prim's death didn't have the impact that I'm sure Collins was aiming for; I didn't feel sad when she died, as she's barely in the story as it is, so I didn't get to know her well enough and connect with her beforehand. She was absent for at least 100 pages before her death came out of nowhere, for God's sake, so her death felt like any stranger's death. (Although it seems her death kind of defeated the point of sparing her from the Hunger Games.) What DID kill me was Finnick's death. Finnick was one of the characters I loved most in this series, and call me petty, but I can't forgive Collins for killing him off after he'd been through so much and finally got to marry the love of his life. It wasn't even a death of purpose. He got eaten by mutts in a sewer, along with half their assassin team. It annoyed me so much because their deaths felt so UNNECESSARY, like they were just a way for Collins to emphasize that ""this is a DEATHLY SERIOUS, VERY BLOODY BOOK!"" It felt like she was just randomly and meaninglessly killing off supporting characters because she couldn't bear to part with her main ones. Deaths are fine when they're important to the plot, but this felt like death for the sake of death.Okay, now on to the REAL disappointment of this book: Katniss herself. One of the reasons why I loved this series was because of Katniss. She was strong, resourceful, clever and cunning, she had an amazing survival instinct and she knew how to persevere. In Catching Fire, these qualities diminished; she was mainly a pawn, a puppet for others to use for their own objectives. But she still had some semblance of control and she was still Katniss. In Mockingjay, all these traits are scrapped and we get a Katniss-clone who is angsty and bitchy and whiny (wasn't Bella in Twilight bad enough?). Half the book, she's throwing herself pity parties in the closet (literally!). Sure, she definitely has reason to be sad and angry, and her life is full of hardships and tragedies. But I thought that the Katniss from the Hunger Games, the Katniss who had to keep her family alive since the age of 12, would be able to fight through and persevere. I guess I wanted a strong victor, a strong heroine, not a self-pitying victim who can't make her own decisions. That's another thing that bothered me: throughout the whole book, she had no control over ANYTHING, not even her own life and actions. She was a empty, lifeless pawn, a zombie if you will, who didn't do anything that wasn't directed or commanded by other people. In this novel, I was expecting her to STEP UP, embrace her role as Mockingjay, use her power/influence to get involved in the rebellion, take control of her life, and make a difference in the outcome of her world. I was expecting to see her grow and change and I was excited for her metamorphosis. Instead, we get this weak girl who's shirking all responsibilities, addled on drugs half the time, and lashing out at people the other half. Not only did she not improve herself from the first book (she was kickass in the first book btw), she got WORSE, an empty shadow of her former self. At the beginning, I could understand her confusion, her pain, her reluctance to be the Mockingjay. It'd be weird if she DIDN'T feel this way, if she didn't have that time of indecision and unwillingness. But after, I expected her to be strong and work through it, to face her fears and obstacles and choose to do the right thing, to really fight for justice. The best things in life never come easy; anybody who's done anything has had to overcome obstacles to accomplish their goals. When she decided: ""I must be the Mockingjay"", my heart soared (cheesy but it did!) and I was rooting for her 100%. When I heard her inspirational words during the propos, the fire behind them, my heart soared because I thought Katniss was back. But as I kept reading, I realized .. even though she verbally accepted her role, her mind still wasn't in it and she wasn't in control of herself. She didn't grow and become stronger, that's what pisses me off.The post-traumatic stress, the mental breakdowns, the self-pity, the self-loathing, the nearing of insanity .. all of these things are realistic, yes, but a bit tiresome and not very interesting to read when it's all the same and the narrator is drowning herself in it in the face of much greater things to the point where it detracts from the plot. These feelings shouldn't be the main focus throughout the ENTIRE novel. There has to be a turning point when she overcomes all of this and actively decides not to let these obstacles stand in her way. Now, many people will say her breakdown is more true to life, and it's what any normal 17-year-old girl would feel and go through. But, maybe I'm weird here, but for some stories, I don't WANT to read about the average, normal teenager. I want to read about someone who's a bit special, who's different, who displays traits (like courage, heart, perseverance) greater than the norm and accomplishes more than the ""normal, average teen"" even during the most difficult of times. Something that, when you close the book, makes you feel like ""Wow, they're amazing. Inspirational. I want to be like that."" & to be honest, I didn't sign up to read a war documentary or some nonfiction account of how war affects its victims. I came in expecting a break from reality, a fantasy sci-fi young adult novel about a girl who becomes a hero.In trying to be as realistic as possible, I think Collins chose a pessimistic extreme of ""realism"" to portray. There are perfectly human people in real life in real circumstances who are able to fight through obstacles and hardships and come out on top without relying on drugs and hiding in closets. They can find more constructive and positive ways to deal with their problems. Sure, it obviously affects them (they're not invincible) but they don't lose themselves the way Katniss does. Those are the kinds of inspirational stories I wanna read when it comes to these kinds of novels, not this ""Diary of an Emo Puppet."" This book was also REALLY anti-climactic. Whenever Collins finally gave us an exciting scene, as soon as it got intense, Katniss would get knocked out in the midst of things and we'd wake up to her in the hospital being treated. (MAJOR COP-OUT, in my opinion.) Then, of course, comes the inevitable centuries (that's what it felt like) of us hearing about her in pain and agony. Okay, we get it after reading about it the WHOLE novel! Now can she please pick herself up and make herself useful?Katniss doesn't deserve the title ""girl who was on fire"" and to be the main character in such an epic setting and story. Sure, she can be on fire, but only when someone sets her on fire or directs her to be on fire, not of her own doing. She was soulless and indifferent and cared about herself and her own feelings more than anyone else's (seeing as how she spends most of the novel grieving for herself and almost never for anyone else) .. if the main character, the narrator, doesn't care about anything and has no passion, why should we? What's the point when the main character whose eyes we're seeing through has no heart and no passion? And what happened to the selfless girl who willingly sacrificed her life to save her sister?The things I did like. I liked that Katniss had 2 seconds of mental clarity and shot Coin instead of Snow (the only time in the book when she was truly thinking clearly and acting of her own accord). I wonder if I'm giving her too much credit though; judging from her selfish one-track mind in this book, I fear that she did this only because Coin killed Prim, not because she saw the bigger picture. Worse yet, I fear this may just have been a result of Snow's manipulation, not her own decision. I also feel the significance and bravery of this smart moment was rendered meaningless by her immediate cowardly reaction: instead of having conviction in her action and facing the consequences, she scrambled frantically to find the most painless and quickest way to kill herself. She never once in the book acknowledges all she has to live for and all the positive things she still has in her life. When a character's will to survive is absent through a whole novel, I as a reader have no desire for them to live either; grant their wish already! But to continue on .. I liked learning about more of the characters in depth: Gale (who I grew to love even more in this book), Finnick, Annie, Boggs, Johanna, etc. I liked the ending passages (fitting and beautifully haunting) and I liked the songs (The Hanging Tree and the meadow one). There are probably some other things that I'll update this review with once disappointment and frustration are no longer clouding my brain.I wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a page-turner that was exciting to read, but trying to finish this book felt like a chore. When reading for enjoyment starts feeling like a chore, that's the ultimate sign that I dislike the book. 90% of the book, Katniss was wandering aimlessly through hallways, drugged out on morphling, hiding in a closet, or lying in a hospital bed. I kept waiting, I was so sure it would happen any minute, for the story-changing moment when Katniss would pick herself up and say ""Enough is enough."" I kept waiting for the moment when the winds would change and she would decide with conviction to actively work through her problems -- but to my shock, that moment never came. This book seriously dragged and dragged and dragged, and just got slower and slower until everyone started dropping dead towards the last quarter of the book. The Hunger Games, I couldn't put it down; for this, I dreaded picking it up to finish it. I did tons of things in between reading this book (doing my nails, watching TV, taking a walk, etc) because I couldn't read it in one sitting without wanting to gouge my eyes out. It was the same reoccurring theme: Katniss was manipulated and controlled by everyone around her and she didn't think or do anything of her own will. It got old. I read all this build-up and didn't get rewarded for it. And even though the rebels triumphed, I didn't feel anything for them, not relief, not happiness, just nothing. I was just detached. And none of it was thanks to Katniss: her only role in the Capitol's defeat was watching Prim die, getting burned, and waking up in a hospital, where we're TOLD instead of SHOWN how the Capitol fell (all while she was unconscious, an occurrence that's way too common in this book). Again, anti-climactic! During the scene when it really mattered!I understand the message Collins is trying to convey and I agree with it: that war is awful and no one truly wins. And good and bad are not clearly defined black and white. (It got too preachy at certain points though, didn't it?) And I understand that not all books are unicorns-and-ponies happy endings, and that this series has always been intense and dark and a bit bleak. But that only works when there's an underlying message of hope and of optimism. I felt it in the 1st books, but this ending was devoid of all hope and happiness. Yes, humans are disgusting creatures who hurt and kill one another, who do horrible things because of greed and selfishness and just pure malice. But humans are also capable of love and compassion and kindness, and I wish she'd incorporated a bit of that into the story as well so there'd be a more hopeful ending. Even in real life, no matter how bad things may be, there is always hope. Isn't that the kind of message you really want young people to be left with? Instead of pessimistic doom and ""give up on mankind""? I finished the book feeling hopeless and lost and depressed, and not in that deep, profound way where it motivates me to get up off my ass and do something to make a difference.Gosh, at least Harry was his own person and got to face Voldemort in the end. What did Katniss get to do except be an empty canvas for them to paint and feed lines to?Though I guess since I'm feeling so passionately about all of this, it wasn't a worthless read. It was just very, VERY disappointing.Edit:I just re-read this review a month or so after I wrote it and I sincerely apologize for my sloppy writing and overindulgence in run-on sentences! I was in a rush to unleash all my feelings after finishing the book so I wouldn't forget anything. I hope this review was understandable and enjoyable anyway :)That's the end of the review and you can stop here but I wanted to add on .. and I'm thinking those who grew up with Harry Potter like I did can relate:So I decided to re-read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to prepare myself for the upcoming movie, and to get the bitter taste of Mockingjay out of my mouth, and here's a passage towards the end where Harry's character really touched me and left me in awe:""Because,"" said Harry, ""sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!""""You're seventeen, boy!""""I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!"" a few sentences later .. ""I'm going to keep going until I succeed -- or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.""Reading it again makes me all emotional and teary all over again, from Dobby's heartfelt burial to Harry's courageous walk to his death in the forest, knowing fully well what awaits him and yet willing to sacrifice himself for others and for a better world ...all the while, struggling with his fears and the temptation to run away .. and I swear, tears of pride and joy sprang from my eyes and exhilaration shot through my veins when Harry, the boy we grew up with, stepped up as a man and faced his enemy with confidence, strength, wisdom.Whatever faults the last HP book may have, I just have to say: Thank you, Harry, for giving me hope again and proving there are still admirable heroes in young literature.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7260188-mockingjay
The Selection;Kiera Cass;2012;2010;336;4.08;1608159;yes;['Romance', 'Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction'];For thirty-five girls, the Selection is the chance of a lifetime. The opportunity to escape the life laid out for them since birth. To be swept up in a world of glittering gowns and priceless jewels. To live in a palace and compete for the heart of gorgeous Prince Maxon.But for America Singer, being Selected is a nightmare. It means turning her back on her secret love with Aspen, who is a caste below her. Leaving her home to enter a fierce competition for a crown she doesn't want. Living in a palace that is constantly threatened by violent rebel attacks.Then America meets Prince Maxon. Gradually, she starts to question all the plans she's made for herself—and realizes that the life she's always dreamed of may not compare to a future she never imagined.;"UPDATE 3/23/2016: YOU GUYS. I owe Kiera Cass a TREMENDOUS apology. Kiera Cass is the mother-effing ORACLE OF DELPHI. GET THAT WOMAN A JOB IN THE WHITE HOUSE, STAT.Because you guys. She predicted Donald Trump's America. Rich businessman. War with China. Renaming country after own self. Creating a caste system based off of how much money one has. I didn't believe this was an America that could happen, but turns out, I was the one who was wrong. *sobbing quietly into nuclear bunker*ORIGINAL REVIEWI almost never write reviews, but I had to write one to try to persuade people to read this book. Really, it has to be read to be believed. This is actually the worst book I've ever had the pleasure to encounter in my life, and I think it's only fair that everyone else get to enjoy it, too. It's the best ten bucks and three hours of my life I've ever spent. I'm not being sarcastic. The entertainment value of this novel is high. Especially if you can reenact scenes out loud with your boyfriend, which I may or may not have done.As for all you people who couldn't finish it? WEAK. Seriously. The effery gets more and more amazing and you missed some inspiring prose. I've read through many of the reviews here, and people have done a good job of covering the problems. Forgive me for treading familiar ground. 1. RIDICULOUS NAMES. I know, Collins did the same thing. But while it works in Hunger Games to underscore the absurdity of the society (the silliest names come from the Capitol or Career districts), here, it just makes all of our descendants sound stupid. Stop smoking pot, kids. Your progeny will be born dumb and name THEIR progeny things like ""America,"" ""Aspen,"" and ""Clarkson."" Please. Think of the children. (Tangent: I was describing this book to a friend, and I said, ""The heroine is named America Singer. She has a really special talent, and you can tell from her name."" My friend: "". . .Is she really good at freedom?"")2. EXECRABLE WORLDBUILDING. Great, even good dystopians SHOULD stem from a plausible scenario of the future (e.g. 1984), and MUST make a commentary on society as it is now (Hunger Games is once again the good example here--it isn't exactly plausible, but all that War is Hell stuff is good). This book fails miserably on both points. Not only is the vision of the future ridiculous and implausible based on the world we know today, it demonstrates a complete lack of historical, economic, political, and anthropological understanding. Midway through the book, we are given a breathtakingly idiotic vision of the future (how has no one addressed this yet? It's like the best part of the book). Apparently, America becomes so indebted to China that China decides to INVADE. No, really. Because if one country is in debt to another and the first country wants its money back, that's what you do! International Relations 101!Only they find out that oops, there IS NO MONEY. Like...the Chinese are sitting there thinking, ""IF ONLY WE INVADE, WE CAN GET OUR MONEY BACK""? Question: WHY DIDN'T AMERICA USE ITS MASSIVE NUCLEAR ARSENAL TO DEFEND ITSELF? Did China defy international conventions and violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty it signed in 1992 WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING? Did America somehow lose its stockpile? HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? If you're not going to keep things vague like Collins, you need to address the GIANT GAPING HOLES in your idea. SO then America becomes the American State of China (HAHAHAH OMFG) and they get...labor! Yeah! The Chinese want American labor! Anyway, after China invades America, the Russians attack. Because they are SMRT and expanding on BOTH FRONTS (Which two fronts? East and . . . up? I think she might mean China, but it's hard to tell). Only, like Napoleon and Hitler learned (WHEN WILL DICTATORS EVER GET IT RIGHT), fighting a war on two fronts is a BAD IDEA. Russia and China have at it, then a dude named Gregory Illea saves America and forms a new government and country NAMED AFTER HIMSELF.Yes. The nation that didn't even name itself after George Washington, decided to name itself after a ""private citizen who donated his money and knowledge."" (Also, in the history of the world, how many countries are named after a PERSON? Not even the worst dictators in the history of the world have done that.) (ETA. Regarding the naming-a-country-after-a-person, I might be wrong. Not sure. See comments.) I suspect that the attitude of this author is best summed up in what one of the instructors says to the Selected: ""Dear girls, history isn't something you study. It's something you should just know."" If Cass had actually studied history at any point, she would have realized how asinine and ill-concieved this vision of the future is.Moving on, though I guess it's hard to move on from that idiocy. Anyway, the book also doesn't make a particularly cogent argument against misogyny, class-ism, or even basic stupidity. For example, the palace is constantly under attack from rebels. I fail to see why the king doesn't DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. Nope. The rebels just keep on breaking in. The king's response? Get some metal window shades. Seriously. He could build an actual fort (which, you know, people managed to do thousands of years ago before they had like tractors and shit). He could move to a secret bunker. He could DIG A MOAT AND FILL IT WITH ALLIGATORS. But no. He got some metal window shades. He deserves to die and this country deserves to fall, just because of the principle of evolution and survival of the fittest. These people ain't it. Finally, the book actually perpetrates and supports misogynistic ideas. For example, Marlee tells America that girls are all bitchy and out to backstab each other. America takes this in stride, instead of, oh, pointing out that her sisters were great to her? Why is it okay to say this or perpetrate this kind of belief about women? Of course it's true of some women, as it's true of some men. But it's not GENERALLY true of ALL women, and to say so is grossly misogynistic. 3. TERRIBLE CHARACTERIZATION. People lack depth, subtlety, and consistency in this book. You have the classic Bitchy Mean Girl, the Devoted Maids, the Kindly Best Friend, the Adorable Young Tyke, and on and on and on. As for lack of consistency: Maxon, for example, is described as being not very good with girls (""I don't meet very many women,"" he says at one point). . . and yet he goes around calling everyone 'my dear' (ewww sleazy, by the way?) like a dedicated Regency rake. It would be one thing if this was described as being awkward, but instead the women all seem to really like it--so he's inexperienced, yet smooth with the ladies? WTF?Maxon is in general the least sexy 'hero' I've ever read. First off, he's a shitty prince. Even America studied the names/faces of the other Selected, but Maxon asks to be ""[forgiven] if [he's] slow with names; there are quite a few [girls]."" You're a PRINCE, Maxon. Learning people's names and remembering them is a PART OF YOUR JOB, especially because you have access to that information. Sit your ass down. Memorize their names and faces. He's also completely ignorant of what's going on in his country until America tells him (and then he becomes an overnight communist because of her. Not that there's anything wrong with communists per se, but I'm still amused). I get that as the prince he was maybe really sheltered from the realities of the caste system, but it's still really unsexy that he hasn't even tried to find out before. It demonstrates a complete lack of curiosity, empathy, and imagination. As a love interest, Maxon is just really creepy. He says, ""You [the Selected girls] are all dear to me. It is simply a matter of discovering who shall be the dearest."" Oh, ick. The problem isn't that Maxon has clearly never been laid, which is fine (I love non-man-ho heroes!), the problem is he's so awkward/sketchy that he also couldn't get laid if his life depended on it. Actually, I wonder if he actually has all his manly parts intact, because he talks/acts/thinks like a not very bright woman. I also really enjoyed this description of Maxon: ""He just looked . . . thoughtful. It was an interesting expression on his face."" Because, you know, Maxon usually just looks dumb as a brick, so when he's thinking, it's totally weird. As for America, her stupidity is kind of endearing. Watching her navigate the world is like watching a toddler cross traffic, only really hilarious. She's unbelievably self-centered, egotistical, and smug. For example, her treatment of her maids is poorly thought out. It's like Cass wants to make America sympathetic by having her care about her maids (such as her concern for the girls during the two rebel attacks), but America's actual behavior towards the girls is condescending and smug. First, she can't be bothered to learn their names/distinguish them from each other. Later, she self-righteously says that she ""enjoys the company of Sixes."" How about saying that YOU NEVER NOTICE CASTES, AMERICA? That would be a better way of putting it. Finally, America seems to think that the girls are TOTALLY HAPPY to just be America's maids and have no outside interests/lives. According to America, they just LIVE to serve her. All people have their own agendas, Cass, and to describe the girls otherwise--especially when you are using them to make a point about America's kindness/thoughtfulness--ends up making America look even more self-absorbed, naive, and oblivious.4. WORSE DIALOGUE. There is no subtlety, no tension. If someone wants to know something? SURE. Any character will spill the inner workings of their mind immediately. Case in point: when Aspen is angry at America for cooking dinner, instead of drawing out the tension and creating a sense of unease with Aspen withholding this information, Aspen simply bursts out the (chauvinistic) truth. Or when Maxon asks America whether or not she can love him (the second time they meet), instead of saying, ""no, you're really creepy/desperate, ew"" or ""how the fuck should I know, I just met you last night,"" which is I think how most girls would respond to that kind of question on the second meeting (NOT even the second date), America says no and then TELLS HIM WHY--a reason that can technically GET HER IN TROUBLE. Who does that? Someone who is acting according to the dictates of plot instead of human nature and their own characterization.(Then another character describes America as 'mysterious' at one point. America, who literally cannot keep her mouth shut about ANYTHING, even her own darkest secrets. Clearly, the author's definition of 'mysterious' is very different from everyone else's.)Cass is also VERY fond of using the dialogue tag ""sing"" or ""sang out."" Of the 7 or 8 times she does this, it fits ONCE (when May sings the ""sitting in a tree"" song.) This is a really idiotic move because I sort of imagine everyone singing in a Miss Piggy tone of voice. 5. PECULIAR DICTION. The queen is described as sitting ""not in an icy way,"" in contrast to her husband and son. Which makes zero sense. Posture is not described as icy: tone is, mien is, but not THE WAY YOU SIT. You can't just use words because you feel like it. Words mean specific things. Also, someone twirls her fork ""menacingly."" No, really. This is one of those fun things you can try to do at dinner tonight. (I get what Cass is trying to go here, but she hasn't described it right. The girl's expression can be menacing WHILE she twirls her fork. Or it can even be something like, ""She was merely twirling pasta on her fork, but she somehow managed to make the gesture look menacing, like she meant to stab me in the eye with it after I was finished eating."" But the way it's written is just abuse of the English language.)America also puts her books on a ""helpful"" shelf. That's how I describe all my furniture when they fulfill their function: chairs are ""helpful"" when I sit in them, beds are ""helpful"" because I can sleep in them, and ""stoves"" are helpful when they HELP ME COOK DINNER. THANKS, STOVE. At one point, America describes Aspen's hair as ""scraggly."" Here is the definition of scraggly:1. (of a person or animal) Thin and bony.2. Ragged, thin, or untidy in form or appearance.Now, I recognize the use of the word ""or"" in this definition: that it can mean ragged, thin, OR untidy. However, words have connotations as well as denotations, and using the word ""scraggly"" implies dirty and thin.Probably not how you want people to imagine one of the love interests' hair. Cass also likes to juxtapose words weirdly, like when America ""whisper-yelled"" at Aspen, or when Maxon laughs ""with a bizarre mix of rigidity and calm,"" or a character who smiles in a way that's both ""excited and timid.""....eh?6. TELLING, NOT SHOWING. America's family is described as poor because they are lower caste. I don't buy it. She has her own bedroom, and her family owns not only a fridge, but a TV, and they eat popcorn while they watch it. Sure, they are kind of hungry (and they don't have enough makeup *tear*), but when they ARE described as having amenities, it isn't explained. And it would have been so easy to do! Such as, ""the fridge was a cast-off from the home of a Three!"" ""Popcorn is cheap, so it's the only snack we can afford!"" ""I had my own room, but only because older sis moved out!"" (It's also unclear what kind of house/neighborhood the Singers live in. Suburbs? Inner city? Rural countryside? This would have gone a long way towards establishing America's poverty).Or people are described as ""regal"" without any indication of what that means (stiff posture? Raised chin? Expressionless face? Walks with a stick up their rears? WHAT? TELL US.) America's first breakfast in the palace: ""The eggs and bacon were heaven, and the pancakes were perfectly done, not too thin like the ones I made at home."" WHAT DO HEAVENLY EGGS AND BACON TASTE LIKE TO YOU, AMERICA? CRISPY? SOGGY? SALTY? DOES THE FAT MELT ON YOUR TONGUE? Writers: make your words count. Here's another stunning example of Cass's descriptive prowess: ""The wallpaper, the gilt mirrors, the giant vases of fresh flowers were all so beautiful. The carpets were lavish and immaculate, the windows were sparkling, and the paintings on the wall were lovely.""What kind of wallpaper is it? How big are the mirrors? What kind of flowers? What do the carpets look like? WHAT DOES ANYTHING LOOK LIKE?This is not how you write description, guys.The telling, not showing also ties into the bad characterization. We are TOLD, for example, that Aspen's mother is kind, because she ""give[s] clothes that didn't fit her kids anymore to families who had next to nothing.""This is not an effective example of kindness. Giving away clothes that you don't use anymore isn't kind, because it lacks the element of sacrifice. It's vaguely charitable at best. If Cass wanted to use this example, she would have had to add something along the lines of ""instead of selling it for money.""7. AWKWARD, STUPID, STILTED PLOT. Witness the 'bargain' that America offers the prince during their first meeting: she offers to be his friend and to help him selected a bride(after spilling all her dark secrets, natch). Then, after like two meetings (dates lol), America is hurt when Maxon didn't tell her something because she thinks that they are 'friends'. Not everyone is you, America. Not everyone tells all their secrets to their actual friends after YEARS, let alone to random people after a mere days. 8. PROBLEMATIC NOTIONS OF LOVE. For example, at one point the prince says, ""I hope to find happiness, too. To find a woman that all of Illea can love, someone to be my companion and to help entertain the leaders of other nations. Someone who will befriend my friends and be my confidante. I'm ready to find my wife.""This is really offensive, and it's never addressed. Maxon's idea of love is incredibly self-centered: someone whom HIS people can love, someone to be HIS companion, someone to help HIM entertain leaders of other nations, someone to befriend HIS friends and be HIS confidante. And sure, a princess is public commodity and she should be popular with his people and not embarrass the country in front of other nations. But even if you strip away the ""public"" aspect, Maxon doesn't at all mention wanting to be friends with HER friends, to be HER support, to be HER companion, to be a part of HER life. He wants to enfold her into HIS life. 9. STATISTICS IS FOR OTHER PEOPLE. I'm a little confused by everyone's lack of understanding of basic statistics in this book. The selection is a lottery, and your odds are Not Good. And yet this book opens, ""When we got the letter in the post, my mother was ecstatic. She had already decided that all our problems were solved, gone forever. The big hitch in her brilliant plan was me.""Um, I hate to break it to you, America, but technically the first big hitch in her problem is STATISTICS. Your problems are not solved until YOU ARE SELECTED. God, if the woman thinks the ""big hitch in her plan"" is America's stubbornness, she must be dumber than a brick--like mother, like daughter, eh? Curse you, mathematics, for being SO DIFFICULTS. Later on, America notes that ""families had already started throwing parties for their daughters, sure that they would be the one chosen for the Selection."" SERIOUSLY? THAT'S LIKE ME CELEBRATING WINNING THE MEGA MILLIONS JACKPOT BECAUSE I BOUGHT A TICKET. 10. FORGET ABOUT THAT MFA. I would say this is pretty much a master class in how not to write a novel. Aspiring novelists, take note. You can learn more about what not to do spending ten bucks on this than in an expensive university writing program11. AUTHORS BEHAVING BADLY. Writing a book is really hard. I respect that. I don't respect the way this author treats reviewers, because reviews are for readers, who deserve to know what they are getting for their money. Edited: You guys, thank you so much for reading. I am blown away by all of your support. The review for The Elite is up, and I'm working on The Heir.

But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves—and herself—while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable—and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.New York Times bestselling author Veronica Roth's much-anticipated second book of the dystopian DIVERGENT series is another intoxicating thrill ride of a story, rich with hallmark twists, heartbreaks, romance, and powerful insights about human nature.";"I want to give a big old round of applause to HarperTEEN and their insane marketing campaign. Bravo. That is not mockery, but a legit salute. I sincerely have to give it up to you for convincing me that I had to own this book. I was caught up and boarded the Twitter hype train as it drove me round and round the blogosphere's Factions. (BTW, I still don't know who drives the damn train.) So, by the time I stepped into my local bookstore and laid eyes on Insurgent I happily handed over my $17.99. I wasn't thinking logically. It was as if I was under a simulation. (HAHAHA! Did you see what I did there?)And that ending? Ugh. I... I... I need a moment. Let me just stop myself right here before I end up writing a really negative review and 1 starring one of the most anticipated books of 2012. But know I am displeased. VERY. Just look at how long it took me to finish the book! -----------------------------------------------What a shame. The most anticipated book of 2012 is my most disappointing read so far. After all the positive reviews I read, I knew for sure I'd love it. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way. I was conflicted on whether to give this book one or two stars. In the end, Insurgent's saving grace is that it simply doesn't belong with some of my other one starred books. So, I feel I must warn whoever stumbles across this review: If this is one of your favorite series and you love it with the burning passion of a supernova, this review might have the potential to piss you off. It might be best for both you and I if you just hit the back button now before things get going. Go on. Spock and I will wait.*whistles*Oh, you're staying, huh? Well, strap yourself in because I have a feeling it might just be one of those reviews...Spock tells me this review must contain mild spoilers in order to logically explain this illogical novel. Sorry, kids. Spock's call.The first big negative right off the bat was that Insurgent picks up directly after Divergent left off. There is virtually no recap to the story or characters and if you read the book a year ago, well, you may be screwed. But thankfully, Roth wrote up a lovely little cheat sheet for just this purpose. Yay! However, the problem doesn't just lie with remembering names. It lies with the connection the reader may or may not have had with the characters in Divergent, which was now non-existent since I could barely remember who was who. What's that you say? So and so just got shot in the head? I'm sorry, I can't find a single fuck to give. Then, we are introduced to even more characters. So, not only do I have to attempt to remember the old characters, but I have to keep track of these newbies too? That's just way too much work. Obviously, this isn't really Insurgent's fault, but I thought it would helpful to point this out.The Plot:What happened here? What happened to the action packed dystopian series I was introduced to in Divergent? Where the hell was Tris and why was Bella playing her role? Why did Four suddenly update his Facebook status to Douche Bag? Who's idea was it to turn Insurgent into a Dystopian Romance? One thing I loved about Divergent was that the romance took a back seat to the story and action. But in Insurgent the action is scattered with a heavier focus on Tris and Four's relationship. Look, that is not what I signed up for. I really don't care if Four loves Tris or if they'll end up riding a unicorn that poops rainbows as they ride off into the sunset. Whatever, whatever, whatever.So, the Erudite are trying to take over their world by creating a new serum for those that are Divergent while the Factionless plan a rebellion. But all that usually happens in the background with occasional mention to keep the reader up to date. Most of the novel we are stuck in Tris' head as she goes into angst mode over Four, her parents and Will. It was so boring I felt like I was stuck in a throwback episode of As the World Turns. On repeat. Save me. But wait! We have a random plot twist at the end right before the battle is about to go down. Marcus (Four's abusive father) decides to enlist Tris to help him retrieve information stolen from Abnegation. He tells her it's super secret and that he can't tell her what it is because it's something you have to see, that she'll just have to trust him. Doing so would betray Four. She agrees.Wait. Pause.Tris hates Marcus. Tris loves Four. Tris doesn't know what information they would be retrieving. She also doesn't know if Marcus is telling her the truth. She has absolutely no reason to believe him. No real evidence to back up his claim. She agrees. Without much thought. Tris is supposed to have an aptitude for Erudite, right? She's supposed to be logical, RIGHT?!Tris, pack your bags. I think Spock has just voted you off the island.That makes no sense! And then when I found out the super big secret, guess what? He could have easily told her! I smell and easy plot cop-out, folks. The secret is kept long enough from the reader just so it can push you off the cliff on the last page.World Building:In Divergent I let a lot slide and roll off me because I was entertained throughout the entire book. I'm known to do that with a lot of books like Wither and Across the Universe, for example. I could not do it with Insurgent. You see, I have the attention span of a fruit fly. If I'm not fully engaged in the book, I'm going to notice things. Things I probably wouldn't care too much about if I were enjoying myself. Like how the Erudite wear glasses just because they're smart. Or how even though Tris is emotionally unbalanced 16-year-old, everyone still looks to her to ""analyze the situation."" Or even how impossible I find these factions. How is it that you can put all of these traits into neat little boxes and ask a person to choose one over the others? This is the same problem I had with The Hunt. In both novels the author tries to pitch an idea of human behavior completely different from what reality is, but you can clearly see the flaws with it. However, the main character fully believes in that world and way of thinking. They try to rationalize it, convince you of it. Yes, I realize it's a Dystopian novel, but this is a hard concept to sell because it makes it difficult for me to sympathize with the main character, their conflicted feelings and understand their world. Believability is key for me and I have a hard time believing this world. Tris frequently switches back and forth between her Dauntless, Erudite and Abnegation sides. Other characters comment on her embracing one trait depending on what the situation calls for it. But this doesn't work for me. Real talk, you can't just put logical thinking back in the toy chest when you decide you don't want to play with it anymore. It doesn't work like that. At least... I don't think so. Spock?I'm getting no-ish vibes.Tris:This series gets a lot of comparisons to The Hunger Games and in a way I can see why. You have your young girl who, one way or another, plays an important part in bringing forth change to her society. And if I really had to compare the two, I'd say that Insurgent is like Mockingjay. Tris is depressed, struggling to hold it together and fight in the war. The difference comes into play when Tris borderline gives up, while Katniss kicked ass until the very end. I'm not saying Tris didn't have the right to be depressed because I do believe she did. But it was really over done for me. I felt like I was drowning in her angst. This book is over 500 pages long and most of the action doesn't even show up to the party until the last 30 pages! So what was Tris doing for the other 500 pages? Not a damn thing. No, scratch that. Spock tells me that is inaccurate. Tris was in fact doing something. She was off being selfless, trying to get herself killed so that no one else would die. Bella is that you? I didn't know you did Dystopias now! That irritated me to no end. At one point she turns herself into the Erudite because they threatened to kill off people until Divergent started surrendering. So, of course, Tris thinks it has to be her and sneaks off to give herself up before the Dauntless can form a plan. Now, let's think about this logically. Tris knows the Erudite want to experiment on her for a Divergent-proof serum. Which means more people would be enslaved and/or killed because of her turning herself in. *facepalm* Then she almost dies, but it was too late because I had run out of fucks by then! So I had to shake Spock down for some.


What do you mean you're out of fucks?! One of us has to care if Tris lives or dies!
The Ending:Okay, lots of spoilers here, folks. Spoilers all around from this point on.I didn't like the ending. I felt cheated because I had hung on for the ending. Everyone said how it made up for the rest of the book and what not, but here's the thing: The ending couldn't make up for all the angst-filled fluff the rest of the book was stuffed with. I didn't feel the anticipation throughout the novel and I hate to admit that I was really tempted to skim. The villan was killed really fast without much of a fight. I always hate when that happens. The villan has been giving the characters hell all throughout the story and by the time their number is up, they beg for their life and die by a simple stab wound?""Yes, if you kill me you'll never find the information!""*stabby stab*>insert blood and stuff<""UGH! I'M MELTING!""*dies*


Still no fucks I see. That's cold, bro.
And the big secret wasn't anything you couldn't have guessed from Divergent. It's revealed that the world is in chaos outside of the fence. Murders, destruction, etc. The weird thing is that I actually forgot about their society being enclosed in the fence until it was brought up near the end. It totally slipped my mind. But, I digress. The entire point of their society was to be a fresh start to the world. Somehow by boxing people in these Factions and waiting for the Divergent to emerge that equates to saving humanity. I'm not exactly sure how that works since the book just ends with that revelation and the Acknowledgements rolled. But I feel like Roth wrote herself all the way to a deserted island, sent up her S.O.S. signal and that cliffhanger fell right out of the sky to the rescue. *sigh* I really hate cliffhangers. It was one of the things that I liked about Divergent. For the most part things were tied up, but with Insurgent? It's quite the mess we'll be walking into in book three.Will I read the next book? Yes, because I've come this far and I'm hoping I will enjoy book three as much as I enjoyed Divergent. I think Insurgent suffers from ""Second Book Syndrome"" and the infamous ""Hype Train,"" may it die in a fire (the Hype Train, not the book). But ultimately, I'm interested in how Roth will explain away everything. Maybe then this whole series will make perfect logical sense to me. Until then, drink time, Spock?More reviews and shenanigans at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11735983-insurgent
Ready Player One;Ernest Cline;2011;2010;374;4.23;1200942;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure'];Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found hereIN THE YEAR 2044, reality is an ugly place. The only time teenage Wade Watts really feels alive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the OASIS. Wade's devoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this world's digital confines, puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession with the pop culture of decades past and that promise massive power and fortune to whoever can unlock them. But when Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by players willing to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade's going to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.;"I originally gave this book 3 stars as harmless lightweight fun, but my opinion of it declined as time went by. Then after reading Armada I fully realized what a talentless one-trick hack that Cline really is so I changed this rating. Plus, his outraged hardcore fans kept coming on here and telling me that I missed the point since I didn't give it 5 stars so I might as well give them something to really be mad about. If you're one of those Cline fans who wants to whine about it in the comments I will just delete it and block you.Adventures in Time MowingAfter my laptop fused to my lawn mower due to a freak lightning strike, I discovered that I could use it to travel through time.“Wow, where’d you come from?”“I’m from 2011. Got a time mower and decided to come to the future. I’ll spare you the full origin story. My name’s Kemper.”“I’m Wade Watts. Welcome to 2044.”“Thanks. I gotta say, things are looking kind of grim around here. Are those mobile homes stacked up like hillbilly skyscrapers?”“Yeah, I live in one of them. We’ve had a lot of problems once the cheap fossil fuels started running out. Life kinda sucks ass these days. Fortunately, we’ve got the OASIS.”“What’s that?”“It’s this virtual reality that’s kind of a combination of the Internet and the biggest MMORPG ever made. Here put this on, and I’ll show you.”“Hey, this is pretty sweet, Wade. But what’s with all this old stuff here in your virtual room. It looks like the ‘80s vomited in here.”“Oh, it’s part of my research for the contest. See the guy who invented the OASIS was this old nerd named James Halliday. He left an Easter egg hidden somewhere in the OASIS and whoever finds it wins the prize. He was totally obsessed with the ‘80s and nerdly stuff like computers, sci-fi, cartoons, movies, comics and video games. He left three keys to three gates hidden in here, and the clues have to be stuff that he loved. So a lot of people like me have to know all about the '80s to hunt for the egg.""“How long has this been going on?”“For years now. Nobody has found the first key yet.”“And you what? Watch movies from the ‘80s? Listen to the music? Read his favorite books? Play old video games?”“It‘s even bigger than that. Because of the contest, the entire world is obsessed with the ‘80s. The clothes and hairstyles are considered cool again.”“Really? Well, I gotta get the hell out of here then. Thanks for showing me this, Wade. How do I log out?”“You’re leaving already? Don’t you want to…Oh, my god! You said you were from 2011? And you’re in your 40s, right?”“Well, just barely…”“So you actually lived through the ‘80s?”“Afraid so. High school class of 1988.”“That’s awesome! You gotta tell me all about it, Kemper.”“Kid, why would you want to hear about that? You’re sitting here with enough computer power to download everything from the collected works of Shakespeare to the entire run of The Wire and you want to hear about the ’80s? Just for a contest?”“I love the ’80s. It was the coolest time ever!”“Uh, not really. In fact, I think the ’90s beat the shit out of them. That not worrying about the Cold War thing was a relief and the music was a lot better. Plus we got to wear flannel. That was fun.”“But… you got to play the old video games in the actual arcades, and you saw the first generation of home computers come out. Plus, music videos and John Hughes movies and Rubik’s Cubes and Michael Jackson’s Thriller album and….”“Yeah, Wade. I lived through it all. I remember when MTV played music videos and when Eddie Murphy was funny. But you’re making me sad, kid.”“Why?”“Lemme tell you a story, Wade. About ten years after I got out of high school, an old buddy I had stayed in touch with had a birthday bash and invited a bunch of us that used to run around together. So we’re at his house drinking and playing cards just like the old days and catching up and playing ‘Remember when?”. It was a lot of fun, but we’d been listening to hair metal and classic rock all night, and at one point, I was flipping through the CD’s.”“Actual CD’s! Not downloads?”“Hell, I’m so old even my post-high school stories are dated now. Yes, Wade, real CD’s. Anyhow, I found a new Foo Fighters album, and I put it in. And this one guy made a face and asked me why I had taken the Guns-n-Roses out. And I said something like the nostalgia had been fun but I needed something from that decade. Being completely serious he said that he didn’t know how I could listen to that stuff, and that he still listened to the same exact music we did in high school. He had just replaced his old cassettes with CD’s. The guy had completely managed to miss grunge and was perfectly happy with the same play list in 1998 that he’d been listening to in 1988. And that was one of the saddest things I ever heard, Wade.”“But maybe he just really liked that stuff.”“I liked it too, once upon a time. And I can still belt out a pretty good version of Relax when Frankie Goes to Hollywood comes on the radio, but it was a certain time and place. Now it’s done. I find it depressing that someone of Gen X would want to be stuck there and never moved on to anything new. But it got worse after that, Wade. Because we got older and then the media started catering to us by going for nostalgia trips on everything from trying to remake the Knight Rider TV show to shitty movies like The Transformers and G.I. Joe to the goddamn Smurfs. I’m tired of it in 2011, Wade. I don’t want a new Indiana Jones movie, I want the NEXT Indiana Jones. But no one is working on that because all of us got obsessed with regurgitating our childhoods over and over.”“That is kind of sad, Kemper.”“What’s even sadder is seeing it happen to a generation that didn’t even live through it. When I was a teenager, I got sick to death of baby boomer nostalgia and there’d be these kids my age who tried to be like damn dirty hippies by wearing tie-dye shirts and going to listen to Grateful Dead tribute bands. They were nostalgic for an era that wasn’t even theirs, and I always thought it was a waste. Don’t be like that, Wade. You seem like a nice kid. Don’t sit here watching Family Ties reruns and playing Space Invaders and making jokes about Ewoks. That was then. This is now. It’s your time and you should be out there trying to find the stuff that will become part of your own memories of growing up, not rehashing ours.”“Gee, Kemper. That’s a really good point. You’ve opened my eyes. Thanks a lot.”“You’re welcome, Wade. By the way, what the hell was this prize that was so good that it got the entire world doing the safety dance again?”“Oh, the winner gets the controlling interest in Halliday’s company and his personal fortune which is about $240 billion dollars.”“Did you say $240 billion? Dollars?”“Yes, so how about we log off. Maybe I’ll take a walk and see if I can find this girl I like. I’ve been…”“Screw that. Fire this rig up, Wade. Put on some Def Leppard and find me a pair of acid washed jeans and some high top Reeboks. Let’s start looking for clues. For $240 billion I’ll live through the ‘80s again.”**************************************************I didn’t actually hate this book. It did a lot of very clever stuff regarding an entire virtual universe. And for a member of Gen X, it was a fast and fun romp down memory lane. It was kind of like Snow Crash meets the Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World movie.But I’ve got a personal pet peeve against people trying to live in the past and since this book is nostalgia porn*, the basic premise did rub me the wrong way. The idea that the kids of the 2040s are just watching episodes of ‘80s TV shows and playing Donkey Kong really kind of depressed me. *I stole that phrase from Flannery’s review. Sorry, Flannery! It was just too good.I might have been able to get past it a little easier if at least one of the kids said something like, “Jesus, I hate this ‘80s bullshit. I can’t wait until his freakin’ contest is over so I can live in the here and now.” But instead all of them treat it like it’s the greatest entertainment ever. So even though a few post ’80s things like Firefly or the Lord of the Rings movies get mentioned, we’re supposed to believe that nerd pop culture reached a zenith in the ’80s and nothing worth geek obsession happened between 1990 and 2040? Sorry, but that seems kind of unlikely and the kind of wishful thinking that an aging Gen Xer would write as he pines for his glory days.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one
The Martian;Andy Weir;2011;2010;384;4.42;1157140;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Adult', 'Thriller'];Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?;"I’m pretty much fucked.
Ok, show of hands. How many of you have uttered these exact words? (or words to that effect). Not everyone? I see we have some liars out there. How many have said them at least twice? Three times? Four? Those with hands still up, you probably need to make some adjustments to your approach, find a safer line of work, hobbies that do not entail long drops, stop trying the weekly specials at McBlowfish, or seek out people to date who are into less extreme…um…sports. These are the opening words of The Martian. Astronaut Mark Watney is definitely more screwed than most of us have ever been. Dude missed his ride and there will not be another along for, oh, four years. Supplies on hand were only meant to cover a few weeks, maybe months. And that Martian atmosphere is definitely no fun, lacking stuff like, oh, breathable air, and a reasonable range of temperature. It does, offer, however, extremely harsh (good for scouring that burned on gunk from sauce pans) and long-lasting (as in months) dust storms. And if that was not enough he faces an array of other challenges. unfriendly locals No, Kibby (the 12-year-old kibitzer who infects my brain), no Mars Attacks brain beasts, or that other guy, even though I know he is your favorite. Real challenges. For example, the music he has for his stay consists of disco. The viewing options include 70s TV. Most of us might give serious consideration to minimizing the guaranteed pain, frustration, starvation and inevitable death by, maybe, taking a short hustle outside sans that special suit. It would be a very, very short last dance. Watney is either a cock-eyed optimist or an idiot. I'm going with the former, as he is indeed made of the right stuff. He is armored and well supplied with the sort of can-do designer genes that might make the rest of us feel like the can’t-do sorts we are. He is the poster boy for positive attitude. It does not hurt that he is way smart, with expertise in a wide-enough range of things scientific to matter. It does not hurt that he is an engineer who gets off on taking apart, putting back-together, figuring out, thinking through, testing, trying, and pushing envelopes. But his crew is headed home, and what hope is there, really?The Martian tells of Watney’s attempt to survive in a literally alien environment, using only the tools on hand and his wits. It is a gripping story with one of the most adorable heroes you are likely to encounter, on this planet or any other. (No, Kibby, not a kitten) How could you not root for a guy who scrapes through Thanksgiving dinner for potato parts to plant for food? Of course, one might think “been there, done that,” particularly as 1964’s  Robin Crusoe on Mars  offered a retelling of Daniel Defoe’s classic tale in a more contemporary notion of a remote locale. A 1905 novel used a different classic traveler in the same sort of format. Of course those tellings had a lot more in common with the Barsoom of Edgar Rice Burroughs as seen by Frank Frazetta than they do with the vision we have of the Red Planet today, or, say, reality. RealityOr is it?One of these was a shot of you know where. The other was taken at Death Valley, which was used, BTW, in the filming of Robinson Crusoe on MarsMost of the tale is spent on Watney’s very compelling attempt to survive, going through all the challenges he faces trying to make air, preserve and maybe generate water, make his food last, get some sort of communication set up, deal with things like exploding air-locks, biblical level dust-storms, toppling ground-transport vehicles, you know, stuff, most of it life-threatening. The other end of things is how the folks on the ground deal with this GInornous OOPS. There are technical elements, of course but more interesting, for me, were the political considerations. To tell the crew or not? Imagine how bummed out, embarrassed, and guilty you might be on that ship (the Hermes) returning home, knowing you had left one behind. Might it affect your ability to take care of necessary business for the next bunch of months? Another question is whether to tell the public, and if so, when. How about getting help from other space-capable nations? Are any international dealings simple? There is also some in-house (NASA) staff maneuvering that is wonderful to see.Andy WeirIn her fabulous book on writing, Bird by Bird, Anne Lamott writes
Having a likeable narrator is like having a great friend whose company you love, whose mind you love to pick, whose running commentary totally holds your attention, who makes you laugh out loud…
Probably the greatest strength of The Martian is the narration of Mark Watney. He is engaging and funny, optimistic and capable. I suppose there are some who might find him lacking in sharp edges, but I thought he worked great. Matt Damon as Mark Watney, enjoying the view  – from the film. The new earth-based shooting location was Wadi Rum, Jordan. I am sure they did plenty of color adjustments in post, but boy-o-boy does this place look like an alien landscape. GripesYes, really, there is too much scientific detail. It is not that it is beyond the comprehension of a lot of readers (although it will skip by a fair number) it is the share of time, the number of pages, the sheer volume of obstacles to be overcome, and the very detailed explanation of so many of them that tilts the book a bit too much towards the MacGyver demo. Weir writes very well about the other elements of the story. Repetition of DANGER, WILL ROBINSON, with the subsequent amazingly clever repair du jour, does get a bit old after a while. I had to fight an urge to scan at times. But that is really it. Otherwise, The Martian is an absolute delight to read. Watney is lovable as well as capable, and makes excellent use of his sense of humor to look on the bright side of life, in a very dark circumstance. Whether he makes it out on time or not (not gonna spoil that one) you will cheer him on, hope for the best, and fly past those pages with considerable, if maybe not interplanetary, speed. Is there life on Mars? There will be while you read this book.

Allegiant;Veronica Roth;2013;2010;531;3.6;1076610;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Adventure'];The faction-based society that Tris Prior once believed in is shattered - fractured by violence and power struggles and scarred by loss and betrayal. So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she's known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories.But Tris's new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningless. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend to complexities of human nature - and of herself - while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.Told from a riveting dual perspective, ALLEGIANT, by #1 New York Times best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the DIVERGENT series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in DIVERGENT and INSURGENT.;"Ten Hours later...When I don’t like a series ending, I tell myself it’s partially my own fault - that the book suffered from my expectations. In the case of Allegiant, I think it went a little beyond that. Hours after finishing and sleeping on my crushing disappointment, I have to admit that very little of this book worked for me. So I’m turning to the device that I always turn to when I’m stressed or overwhelmed with something: lists. As always in a review of this nature, there will be MASSIVE SPOILERS for all three books in this series. I’m using a cut, and it means very definite business.Things that Did not Work for Me in Allegiant, a List by Kate1. The World BuildingWhen you think about both Divergent and Insurgent, there was very little actual world building that went on. We established the faction system and the way it functions in Divergent. We also established the problems inherent with that system. In Insurgent, we explored those problems more by watching the breakdown. And then, in the end of Insurgent, we find out that it’s all an experiment intended to save the outside world from war and violence and poverty.Then, we get to Allegiant. Everything in the video is a lie (so, in a lot of ways, everything Tris did at the end of Insurgent was for nothing). The outside world is basically Chicago 2.0, only instead of being divided by personality type people are divided by the extent of their broken genes. It’s an interesting thought and a cool platform for philosophizing, but so much is crammed into this book that we don’t have time for those subtleties. Basically, we have one book to learn the mass of information we need to know about the outside.This info dump is compounded by several things: 1) Everything we thought we knew about the outside is a lie and some things we thought we knew about the people on the inside is a lie, too; 2) Tris knows nothing about the outside so things that we know about as readers keep being off-handedly explained to her and also not explained to her; 3) a lot of what Tris has to figure out is science and history, and there's not the sufficient background needed to help with suspension of disbelief.This is clearly supposed to be far into the future - at least seven generations? - but fundamentally it’s still the world we know. We knew that because of the fact that Chicago was clearly recognizable. But knowing that everything on the outside is basically still functioning through our government and that the same kinds of issues still cause problems? Something about that made me question every piece of information thrown at me.There was too much information introduced in this book for it to be the closing of a series and I honestly think this whole series would have benefited from a fourth book.2. Character Developmenta. The background charactersNone of the background characters went anywhere significant. I did not learn anything new about Cara, Christina, or Uriah. I could have eliminated all three of them from this book and everything would have been the same. Even Uriah’s injury and death felt like a plot point for Four that was ultimately completely glossed over. Peter and Caleb showed no growth or change. Peter proved that he is still the same coward he has always been (and yet somehow he gets exactly what he wants). Caleb, too, proved a coward. He was given the chance for redemption and he didn’t take it. As for Natalie Prior, I thought her backstory was interesting. It was one of the few interesting things about the book, though I thought the “love triangle” was unnecessary and slowed the plot down. I also couldn’t wrap my brain around why, when she found out Tris was divergent, she wouldn’t have told her at least some of this information she knew, something that would help her daughter and her society. And even though it was interesting backstory, it didn’t change Natalie Prior’s motivations for saving her daughter and acting as she did.There was a rash of seemingly senseless deaths in this book. First, Edward dies. But...why? To show that the factionless show as little regard for human life as the Erudite did? For the two page scene in which we don’t know if Evelyn is upset by his death? The same thing with Tori, who died, it seems, simply to provide the moment in which we find out how wrong she was and that her brother now has to deal with her death?But...why do I care about George Wu? This problem ties back to the world-building problem and the need for another book. We are introduced to so many new characters. Some lady whose name I can’t remember, Amar, George, Nita, Matthew, David, all the people from The Fringe. The people from the Fringe? We barely learn anything besides their names. Amar and George are there, it seems, to provide some familiarity for our refugees, but we barely see them and they don’t teach us anything new about the inside or the outside. Then we get to Nita, who plays a major role and then just seems to disappear. Matthew has a nice little speech about the Terrible thing that genetic prejudice caused to happen, but who is also basically a clone of Cara. And David, who is exactly, exactly like Jeanine. Having so many new people cut out our chance to see the people that mattered.Like...b. TrisTris came a long way in Insurgent and she learned a lot of things. I thought, overall, she was doing well and continuing that trend (until the end, which ruined everything). But here was my problem with Tris: besides what happened at the end, was she wrong about ANYTHING in this book? It’s like she could perfectly read every situation and every person, and she was kind of a condescending jerk about it. She wants to act like she’s never been wrong, but I remember her surprise at Caleb’s betrayal. I remember that it took a bit for her to figure out Evelyn was Four’s mother. I remember that she didn’t see Al’s betrayal coming, or even Eric’s. I remember that she didn’t see through Evelyn’s plan until it was already happening. Tris isn’t infallible, and I liked that about her. Those mistakes made Tris human. But in Allegiant? she’s suddenly perfect. She is smart and strong and skilled and canny and selfless to a ridiculous extent. It makes it hard for us to blame Tris when she’s annoyed that people are ignoring her or not trusting her gut. It also makes Four’s journey that much more difficult to handle, because knowing that she’s always right means that he’s always wrong. And he kind of is. c. FourI really wish we had not gotten Four’s point of view in this book. I’d say a big portion of the problems I had stemmed from the dual points of view. Fundamentally, we had to learn everything new through both characters because obviously they reacted differently to everything. This really slowed down the pacing and bogged this book down in repetitive backstory. His sections of the book were indistinguishable in both tone and voice. Though Tris and Four complimented each other so well in the first two books - made an excellent team of equals - they are also very different personality types. Sure, they have similar characteristics - the same kinds of things make them tick - but they go about things in a very different way.I’ll be honest. I didn't find Four likable in this book. I got flashes of the Four I loved, but he was so mired down in all of his weaknesses that reading his portions of the book was really hard. He is the one that was so mad at Tris in the last book for lying, and he is the one that told her at that he should trust her and not hide things from her. But, what happens? Four finds out that he’s not really divergent (um, ok?), and then he completely breaks down and immediately loses all the growth he’d accomplished in the first two books and does something stupid.Part of me understands that the point is that Four isn’t perfect; he has four fears, but those four fears are so much bigger and more terrifying than most people’s ten or twenty (or my thousand). He has Major Issues. However, I knew that about him already. We already watched this struggle with the need to do something to make the world better and also the need to protect Tris and be a good man in the face of incredibly difficult choices. We spent a book watching him deal with his feelings for his mother and father, even if we never watched him deal with those things from this point of view. It was wrenching, but it made him grow.This Four is broken. He has lost all of the defining elements that made him Four. He is weak and indecisive and insecure and, most surprisingly of all, irrational. His participation in Nita’s plan baffles me. Since when has Four ever blindly trusted anyone’s plan (or anyone, for that matter), let alone a stranger’s? Since when does he not at least argue with Tris OR ANYONE about the moral complications of what is happening? It’s one thing for him to go along with Evelyn’s plan (though even then only at first); that relationship and his feelings are complicated. Here, his decision makes no sense. He barely knows Nita. Why is he not working with Cara and Christina and Tris? Why is he not asking that they be involved? It made no sense to me, even in context of losing his identity.And then, his actions and his part in this plan are ignored? There are no consequences aside from the fact that Uriah is unconscious and ultimately dies. (That entire plot point just seemed pointless. Tris is going to be plenty mad about Four being so stupid already; Four is going to feel plenty guilty about acting like a completely naive hayseed without Uriah having to eat it). Then the issue became about Uriah instead of why on earth he made this ridiculous decision and what he was feeling. After this incredibly boneheaded and uncharacteristic decision? I don’t even know what the hell to make of what was going on with Four. I did not understand his motivations. I did not understand the personality he suddenly exhibited. It felt like he was simply moving forward the plot instead of being Four. Plus, he spends all of Allegiant being broken down and we never really see him built back up.3. The PlotThis plot was repetitive. In Insurgent, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews. In Allegiant, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews 2.0/3.0. It is the same struggle. Of course, on one level that makes sense. Tris is chasing this problem up the chain. She’s discovering that the root of this problem is bigger than Jeanine Mathews and that the outside and its problems never really stayed outside. I did appreciate that aspect. The pacing was an issue. It was slowed considerably by the excessive amount of info dumping and also the dual points of view. It also felt formulaic. It was so paint by numbers and repetitive that it became predictable, in part because Tris is always right and in part because there’s no time for nuance thanks to all the random information being thrown about and all the random things that keep happening. And yet, even with the repetition and the predictability and the deus ex machina moments, this plot was a confused mess and most of it was completely unnecessary to where we went.And good lord the ending of no sense. The holes in this plot were insane. The main conflict seems to be that the Bureau, who has controlled Chicago and Tris’s life, wants the Chicago experiment to keep going. Tris wants those people to know the truth and be free. (Four doesn’t seem to know what the hell he wants). In order to keep things going, the Bureau wants to wipe the memories of Tris’s friends and the families of her friends. Her grand solution? Wipe the memories of the bureau instead. Erase their memories of genetic prejudice....What?We know there are antidotes to basically every serum, from the death serum to the truth serum. We also know there’s an inoculation to the memory/Abnegation serum. So why does it occur to NO ONE that instead of say, inoculating Christina’s family and Uriah’s, that they, say, INNOCULATE EVERYONE?! If they inoculate the people in Chiacago, then David and the Bureau can't wipe their memories. At the very least, this seemingly obvious solution buys them time to figure out what the hell to do.	Instead, it’s decided Caleb will sacrifice himself by breaking into a vault of memory serum and releasing it into the air before the death serum can claim him (which everyone completely 100% believes will happen and it occurs to no one that Tris of all people will never ever let him do this).Four heads into the city to give the memory serum to only one of his parents because he’ll only have time for one but GASP WHICH WILL HE CHOOSE?! Ok. Let’s think about this. The memory serum is intended to allow the two groups in Chicago to come to an agreement. How on earth does giving Marcus the serum help that goal? Evelyn will still remember that he beat her. Evelyn will still remember that he beat Tobias. Evelyn will still want to prove her strength over him because she rightfully HATES Marcus. So clearly Evelyn is the only logical choice because if she can forget what Marcus did to her, what the factions did to her, she can come to an agreement because she’ll have forgotten all the things that motivated her to fight in the first place. Marcus is just a power hungry dickwad, that's fundamental to him like knowing how to breathe. Knowing this (and I don’t understand how you could not, especially in the context of Four’s weird relationship with his mother versus the fact that basically he wants his dad to be dead) all the tension is gone from Four making this decision because we all know there is no decision.Of course, knowing this, we also know that Four is never going to give his mother the memory serum. What is completely unbelievable in the end is that Evelyn - the same Evelyn who has proven herself to be a dictator and a tyrant, who abandoned Four, who lied to Four, who tried to push away the only person who has ever supported Four and believed in him in his entire life, the same person who has been motivated by nothing but hate of the factions with seemingly little thought to her son - is magically made reasonable by love of her son. ...what?This makes no sense in the context of what we know about Evelyn based on what we’ve seen her do. She doesn’t even argue with Tobias. It’s just sobbing hugs and forgetting everything she’s done so she can have the PROSPECT of her son one day being in her life. I’m supposed to believe this because we had a scene with her staring at the blue vase she gave him? And, of course, they go out and shake hands with Johanna and Marcus gets his just desserts because everyone knows he is an evil scumbag bent on power and everything magically works out fine despite the fact that people were rioting in the first chapter and the rest of the factionless are just going to forget their anger because they love Tobias...oh wait.Meanwhile, back in the compound...4. The Message?I knew in my gut as soon as I started reading the second instance of Tobias’s point of view that Tris would die. But still, I hoped I was wrong. I wanted to be wrong. And I wanted to be wrong because it doesn’t make any sense with Tris's growth.Every. Single. Book. Every single book Tris goes off to do some sacrificial act to save the people she cares about. That is basically all she does in Insurgent. And what is her lesson at the end of Insurgent? She wants to live. She doesn’t want to die - she wants to fight and save the world. But we all know as readers, from the moment they mention that stupid vault’s booby trap, that Tris is going to walk into it. We know she is. And...I hated it. First of all, it completely screwed the little character development we’d seen from Caleb. Oh, so Tris points a gun to your head to make you give you the backpack? And you believe her? Stupidest Erudite EVER. Because why would she shoot you, you idiot, if she is about to walk into a death serum pressure cooker TO SAVE YOUR LIFE? It was believable when Tris said she’d shoot David to keep them from getting the password. But she doesn’t want Caleb to die. When he lets her have the backpack - when he lets Tris walk into that chamber? - I have never been so disappointed.I was disappointed in Tris too, because she stole Caleb's redemption. Maybe he lives and redeems himself in some other way, though considering he was an accessory to the slaughter of an entire faction, betrayed his sister, and is generally of weak character, why would anyone believe that he can redeem himself in any other way? So at gunpoint, she steps up to make this sacrifice and we all knew she was going to do it all along and how did Tobias not? I don’t mind character deaths in books. I think, when handled correctly, they are touching scenes that teach the reader something. I think about Dumbledore dying and my chest aches. I think about so many other deaths in books, from Rue in Hunger Games to Bridge to Terebethia, and I know that deaths of characters you love can matter and make a book beautiful and better and teach you things about yourself and the world and love and all of it.But the death has to matter. And Tris’s didn’t. In the (very rushed) end, we find out that people can depend on each other? Can mend each other? We find out that Four is still grieving Tris but is maybe starting to move on, that he doesn’t talk or think about her much because of how much it hurts? Is Peter right? Tobias is young. Someday he’ll move on and he’ll remember Tris, but he’ll keep living. And it’s true; moving on is brave. That’s what life is and what it requires and we have to be grateful for the moments we spend with the people we love and the impact they have. But I needed so much more from Tobias at the end to make his loss of Tris worth that message.I hated, too, the way Tris’s death was handled. Because what was Tris doing? She was running into her mother’s arms and asking if she could be finished. Wanting to be done, implying a choice, even though she JUST told Caleb to tell Tobias that she didn’t want to leave him. If she’d gone down fighting, I’d have bought this more. But she seemed to welcome death - to want it - and that reverts her straight back to the things she supposedly learned she DIDN’T want in InsurgentI don’t understand why Tris’s death did anything to make that message more real. If anything it makes it less so. It’s easy to band together in grief - to find the people who understand and cling to them and form a stronger bond while you do. We saw that already with Christina and Uriah. I think this book wouldn’t have been able to gloss over everything if Tris had lived. Like Uriah’s injury and demise, a lot of this ending was hurriedly tied up with her death. We didn’t have to see what really happened in the aftermath. We didn’t have to deal with the choices for society. Tris’s death was sand for the characters to bury their heads in. This book didn't have a hopeful ending because nothing really changed. 90% of the characters are dead and everyone forgives everyone almost everything because they care about them? This is the foundation of rebuilding and stability upon which these characters and this world can grow? I’d have given up Tris (and Tris and Four) if it left Four and the the people she cared about with strength and hope and a better world, but I didn’t see that it did.  Things that Worked for me in Allegiant, a list by Kate1. There was a lot of making out.2. Though I wanted more from the ending, Four's pain was certainly poignant.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18710190-allegiant

No one knows why Juliette's touch is fatal. As long as she doesn't hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don't fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war—and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she's exactly what they need right now.Juliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.;"So, I actually didn't hate this as much as I thought I would. I enjoyed maybe thirty percent of it before it all went downhill, but... um... it really went downhill. I do not like to think about eyeballs. They just exist. I don't want to look at them. I hate this cover. But that's irrelevant. The hideous covers are irrelevant. But... is that Adam's eye? Because the only thing I took from this is that Adam's eyes are blue blue blue blue cobalt blossoming bruise clear as the midnight sky blue. 
Dark blue eyes dark brown hair sharp jawline strong lean frame.His eyes are the perfect shade of cobalt, blue like a blossoming bruise, clear and deep and decided.I've tried so hard to get those blue blue blue eyes out of my head but I know him I know him I know him. ...blue and bottomless...I'd recognize your eyes anywhere in the world. He still has the most unusually blue eyes I've ever seen. ...the deep dark blue of the eyes I've learned to swim in.His natural tan offsets a pair of eyes a shade of blue in a midnight sky. 
*aggressive coughing*Ma'am, this is a Wendy's. I actually didn't mind the writing, as long as it wasn't about Adam's eyes. The biggest complaint I see is usually related to the purple prose and long-winded metaphors and awkward phrases, but I enjoyed it...? To a point. I thought most of the strange metaphors were accurate, and the somewhat unconventional style of writing really helped to portray Juliette's trauma, which was my favorite part of the book. Too bad it all disappeared when she ✨fell in love.✨ Because that's just how the world works. I did find some, uh, interesting quotes:
Raindrops are my only reminder that clouds have a heartbeat.I wonder about how [raindrops are] always falling down, forgetting their parachutes as they tumble out of the sky toward an uncertain end. It's like someone is emptying their pockets over the earth and doesn't seem to care where the contents fall, doesn't seem to care that the raindrops burst when they hit the ground, that they shatter when they fall to the floor, that people curse the days the drops dare to tap on their doors. I am a raindrop. 

Someone picked up the sun and pinned it to the sky again, but every day it hangs a little lower than the day before. It's like a negligent parent who only knows one half of who you are. It never sees how its absence changes people. How different we are in the dark. I'm wearing dead cotton on my limbs and a blush of roses on my face.I catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around my body, as they cover me in something that feels like the absence of courage. These words are vomit. This shaky pen is my esophagus. This sheet of paper is my porcelain bowl.1 word, 2 lips, 3 4 5 fingers form 1 first.1 corner, 2 parents, 3 4 5 reasons to hide. 1 child, 2 eyes, 3 4 17 years of fear. I wish I could stuff my mouth full of raindrops and fill my pockets full of snow. I wish I could trace the veins in a falling leaf and feel the wind pinch my nose.Every muscle every movement tightens, every vertebra in my spinal column is a block of ice. My eyes are 2 professional pickpockets, stealing everything to store away in my mind. My words wear no parachutes as they fall out of my mouth. My dreams are bloody and bleeding and blood is bleeding all over my mind and I can't sleep anymore. The prospect of Adam in pain is like a cold hand clutching my esophagus. I can shoot a hundred numbers through the chest and watch them bleed decimal points in the palm of my hand. I can rip the numbers off a clock and watch the hour hand tick tick tick its final tock just before I fall asleep. I can suffocate seconds just by holding my breath. I've been murdering minutes for hours and no one seems to mind. I could jump up to catch a breeze and live in its windblown ways forever. His lips are spelling secrets and my ears are spilling ink, staining my skin with his stories. My lungs are sawing my rib cage in half, but I force them to process oxygen anyway. I take a few bites of oxygen. My face has been slapped by a hundred hands.
And one of those hands is mine. It's like... here, I'll write an example. Here's a normal sentence:""I walk down the cold hall.""Now make it as awkward as possible:""I walk down the hall, the linoleum as cold as the corpses of the women and children they've killed, and my spine conducts enough electricity to power an entire city.""THE CHARACTERSJuliette: I didn't love her, but I liked the portrayal of trauma even though it suddenly disappeared halfway through. She needs to stop thinking in strikethroughs, but I don't have any real complaints. She's frustratingly stubborn at times, but she's a YA protagonist, obviously she's going to be stupid. Juliette can torture/kill people with her touch. She was locked away at a young age and has lived in solitary confinement ever since. She's a little kooky. I don't really care. Adam:Are you serious? I have to choose between an obsessed problematic psycho serial killer love interest and a blander-than-bland cardboard cutout organic whole wheat waffle love interest?? Adam is the organic whole wheat waffle. He's probably better for Juliette than the psycho serial killer, but apparently he's not the endgame LI. To summarize his character development, he went from a somewhat interesting mysterious weirdo and Juliette's third grade friend to... a very bland concerning weirdo and Juliette's third grade friend. This is instalove disguised as we-were-friends-as-kiddos-and-now-I-love-you. Which is probably worse. Adam's entire backstory is that he was hit as a kid once (this was never mentioned again) and he's spent his entire life searching for Juliette. Because logic. I wouldn't have minded the abuse subplot if it were actually a subplot instead of something mentioned once and thrown away. Maybe if it, I don't know, actually affected him, I would call it deep and move on.I was okay with him until he and Juliette had a little dialogue sequence. He tried to give her a blanket (this was before he knew that she had magical killing powers) and she told him not to touch her, but he was being all rebellious and she said it again, and then she said this, to which he replied:
""Maybe I don't want you to.""He makes a harsh sound. ""I disgust you that much?""
When someone tells you not to touch them, you back off. It's basic courtesy and respect. Don't assume it's about you. Warner:Warner is the obsessed problematic psycho serial killer. In case you were wondering. Some of my friends have been telling me Juliwarner is a better ship than Julikent. I beg to differ. Adam may be an organic whole wheat waffle, but at least he's not an edgy guy with problems that could be solved by therapy but he's too tough for therapy so there's that. Ahem. He's, uh, strangely obsessed with Juliette and continually tries to make advances on her even after she shows no interest in him. First of all, he needs to stop. Second of all, he's blond?? That was random, but since when are villains blond? I was picturing him with black hair until I searched up fanart to see what Juliette looked like and Warner was there with his blond hair. This is not okay. WORLDBUILDINGWhat worldbuilding? All I know is that there's something called The Reestablishment, which is a dystopian government that does bad stuff. What bad stuff? Who knows? And apparently the planet is all desolate now because the sky is gray. *looks outside* Oh no, the sky is gray. We must be living in a post-apocalyptic world because obviously clouds aren't a thing.

Now with the group narrowed down to the six Elite, the competition to win Prince Maxon's heart is fiercer than ever—and America is still struggling to decide where her heart truly lies. Is it with Maxon, who could make her life a fairy tale? Or with her first love, Aspen?America is desperate for more time. But the rest of the Elite know exactly what they want—and America's chance to choose is about to slip away.;"So, you see my rating, and you're probably like, 
ONE STAR?
 And my answer is yes, one star. I spent a good hour thinking about a reason, any reason to rate it two, but I can't. This was just one books of those books that was not my cup of tea. Which, by the way, is extremely disappointing, considering that I really did like the first book. *sigh*I don't like to bash books and insult the author, but I will say why I did give it such a low rating, in a hopefully non-rude way. *My Opinion. Just a reminder, in case you're thinking about ripping me apart.*My Opinion is....Nothing happened throughout this book. I literally spent 319/323 pages reading about America's ever-changing feelings for Aspen and Maxon, which, by the way, was by far one of the most infuriating and unrealistic love triangles I have ever read about. How, please tell me, did Maxon still ""love"" America after how uncaring she was towards his feelings? I understand that she was still kind of confused about her supposed ""feelings"" for Aspen, but after the fourth or fifth time she led on, and then proceeded to reject both boys, I would've just given up. There was no excuse for her to be angry that Maxon was seeing the other girls. He deserved to love someone who would reciprocate that emotion, even it that ""someone"" was Celeste. Or Kriss. Or even freaking Aspen. *plot twist, Aspen and Maxon are in love* (i ship it)Besides the constant push-pull of America's emotions and how indecisive and clumsy she was with the two boys' hearts, the dialogue. Oh, the dialogue. And the dreadful CRYING. Every. Other. Page. That aside, I felt as though the characters were robots. There was no realistic motive behind any of their interactions, whether those interactions were verbally or physically. It felt like a bad sitcom. Everything was scripted (which it kind of is, in a sense), nothing felt realistic or raw, and if I had to read the work WONDERFUL one more time I was going to FLIP. When is Cass's birthday? I'll get her a thesaurus. I was honestly so close to throwing this book at the wall in frustration but as much as I despise some books I simply cannot because it's still a book and my whacked out brain believes they have feelings so THANK YOU KURT The number of facepalms this book and I shared was astronomical. I have a bruise on my forehead. Dear America:I have other things to say, but they'd just be negative towards the book, and I think I've said enough derogative things. But OH MY GOD I COULDN'T STAND THIS A disappointment in the end. I rarely do this, but do to the aggravation this book put me through and how much chocolate I had to eat to get through this (i blame you, The Elite, for the approximately 50 pounds I gained), I won't be reading The One. Or maybe I'll wait to see if that one is better. We'll see. If you enjoyed this book, good for you! I wish I did too. If you didn't, I feel ya. I will say something nice about this book, and that is that this series has seriously the prettiest covers ever. Too bad there isn't a separate rating for books covers. I normally hate when you see the character on the cover too, because they usually turn out looking different than how I picture them in my head, but this one is an exception. So, pretty dress? Too bad that doesn't make up for well, everything else. I'm going to go eat more chocolate and watch criminal minds to make myself feel better.*please don't kill me for writing this review* *I'm actually a nice person I swear* *gives you some of my chocolate so you won't hurt me*Um hello update: 170 likes?!

But as the end of the competition approaches, and the threats outside the palace walls grow more vicious, America realizes just how much she stands to lose—and how hard she'll have to fight for the future she wants.;"Originally posted at Writer of WrongsGillian: Hey, Gillian. How are you doing today? You look nice.Gillian: You don't.Gillian: We're the same person, so you kind of just insulted yourself.Gillian: I need to talk to you about The One. You're the only one who understands me.Gillian: Well, yeah, that's because I am y--Gillian: I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU CAN YOU PLEASE JUST FOCUS.Gillian: Sorry. Proceed.Gillian: So, that was a book. A book that happened.Gillian: Was it? Was it, though? Or did you hallucinate ninety percent of what occurred? You did read it really late at night.Gillian: This is a distinct possibility. Though even my fever dreams tie up loose plot threads better than... that.Gillian: But you liked it! You laughed! I heard you!Gillian: I laughed when a major character died.Gillian: Okay, but you laughed.Gillian: A major character's death that has nothing to do with the plot, is not born of the plot even though it so easily could have been, does not change the plot that follows or the main character in any way, and is executed SO POORLY that I could only guffaw in sadistic glee.Gillian: I think you might be a very evil person.Gillian: It was basically a sadness intermission. WE INTERRUPT THIS CORNY ROMANTIC SMOOCHERY TO BRING YOU SOME BREAKING SADNESS. America hardly felt sad at all, and I got the feeling this part of the book was meant to be seeeeped in grieeeeef, and yet there was no grief to be found. None. And heart trouble? HEART TROUBLE?! You kill off a major character in a series ender not through rebel shenanigans or anything, but HEART TROUBLE?!?!?!?!Gillian: Don't even pretend you weren't devastated when SPOILER died at the end.Gillian: Okay. That actually got me. FINALLY Kiera Cass writes an interesting character, and then she has to go and ruin everything with a COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS ENDING THAT COMES OUT OF NOWHERE WHEN THOSE STUPID REBELS DO THEIR STUPID REBEL THINGS AND IT MAKES NO DAMN SENSE AND OH MY GOD. I'm telling you. This wasn't real.Gillian: But what about the ship! You like shipping.Gillian: I do like shipping. I don't like when characters change their minds and hearts abruptly from one book to the next. I don't like it when a book has like fifteen cheesy declarations. I like where Cass meant to take her characters in terms of growth and epiphanies, but I cannot believe the way she took her characters there. One of the characters maintained a VERY STEADY position throughout both books, and poof! Book three, totes changes their mind. Because that happens.Gillian: But you didn't want to stab America in this one. Or even Asspen! That's progress!Gillian: Wow, you're right. I feel like I've grown as a human being. I no longer feel like committing fictional murder. America is no longer a waffling, waifish wattle-brain, and Asspen is less of a grunt grunt caveman, even though all of this growth occurs spontaneously in like the first chapter. BUT. THE. PLOT.Gillian: Oh, the plot wasn't that bad...Gillian: *stares*Gillian: Okay. It was that bad.Gillian: Hot. Freaking. Mess. There are two rebel groups: Northerners, who are Capital G Good, because they'e all YAY MONARCHY, and Southerners, who are Capital B BAD, because they want to shoot everybody and don't think the sun shines out of Maxon and America's royal behinds. Maxon and America are like, ""Oh no! We can't let the bad rebels win!"" And then things happen that have nothing to do with their actions. Asspen is somewhere in the background, being a noble ass. Marlee pops in for ONE SCENE and then pops right back out. Like um, thanks for visiting this supposedly epic series ender. Thanks for participating. Celeste the Bitch is abruptly and suddenly is humanized (which, actually, yay). The King continues to twirl his mustache, and the Queen continues to be the brainwashed victim of an abusive relationship who is canonized by every other character in the book.Gillian: Okay, but that's not a plot.Gillian: Don't be silly. Of course it is! There are romantical misunderstandings, pretty dresses, AMERICA IS A NOBLE HEEEEERO, Maxon what the fuck, ugh Asspen are you still here?, REBELS REBELS THE REBELSSSS!!!!, did that really happen how did that happen, the endddd.Gillian: That... wait, is that a plot?Gillian: No. It's not. And those god damn sketchily-assembled rebels and their stupid conflict. I don't want to talk about it.Gillian: Do you want to talk about how accidentally sexist this is? And how SPOILER needs a girl he can protect and SPOILER needs a man to shield her and guide her? And how these are held to be very, very good things?Gillian: No.Gillian: Fair enough. Do you want to talk about how stereotypically ""Asian"" Elise was made out to be, and that her life philosophy is apparently ""Honor to Us All"", and how offensive it was when Kriss pitied her for it?Gillian: No.Gillian: Should we bring up how the Palace security must be run by blind gerbils because that's the only way those fucking rebels could manage to get inside the fucking buildings six times a chapter?Gillian: No.Gillian: Do you want to talk about how pointless (and predictable) it was that SPOILER and SPOILER were secretly Good Rebels even though nothing came of that information. Gillian: No.Gillian: Well, we have to talk about something.Gillian: No. I don't want to. You can't make me.Gillian: It was your idea to talk in the first place!Gillian: I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.Gillian: Should we talk about that cheesy ass epilogue?Gillian: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA oh my god was that a glorious thing. A comedic masterpiece, that was.Gillian: You don't have to be mean about it.Gillian: I EARNED THE MEANNESS, BUDDY. I bought this with my MONEY.Gillian: As opposed to buying it with your couch?Gillian: Shut up. I have no brains left after that. This book did not fit with the rest. This book did not feel like the continuation of the ""plot"" set up in anemic book one and frustrating book two. I couldn't even get mad at this book because I didn't believe this book. Not one freaking word of it. Gillian: Look, no one forced you to read this series.Gillian: MAXON DID. STUPID MAXON AND YOUR STUPID ENDEARING LAMENESS. Why do I care so much about you? Why are you doing this to me? Why were you a flip-flopping mess in this book? Why are there plot holes so large you could drop a truck or a 747 or California through them?Gillian: But Cass kind of did a Red Wedding thing there. That's... um, that's something, right?Gillian: Fungus is something. Sunburns are something. That ending is something.Gillian: That was way harsh, Tai.Gillian: LOOK. Endings, particularly to series, need to COME FROM SOMETHING. They can't just randomly happen and then conveniently the people who need to die for there to be a HEA die and then somehow that magically fixes EVERYTHING and NO. When George R. R. Martin kills people, he does it to complicate the plot. Not to just have it happen. Not to resolve things. NOT AS AN ENDING. And then there's the fact that the action is SO CLUNKY, so unrealistic, so poorly described, that i just laughed laughed because it lasted so long and some people could free and others bled out under tables and America did nothing and oh god horrible action scenes are horrible.Gillian: You should really breathe between rants.Gillian: I CAN'T EVEN.Gillian: Do you want to talk about the cliches?Gillian: There was a cheesy death fakeout. There was a cheesy ""Save yourself! Live and be happy!"" scene. There was a cheesy letter written from beyond the grave full of wisdom and truth. It was an endless avalanche of cliche. America and Maxon are the only non-cardboard characters. The worldbuilding is nonsense. The writing is clunky, amateurish, and obvious. I need a drink. I need several drinks.Gillian: Yes, but that's been true since the beginning, and yet you still read them all. Even those novellas.Gillian: I once described this series as being like a deep-fried Oreo, and it's mostly still good. It sounds like a better idea than it is, it has this weirdly addicting, saccharine-sweet junk food quality, and it has zero nutritional value. But then this third book happens and it's... it's just... it's so bad I can't even find an accurate food metaphor. A tomato and marshmallow smoothie.Gillian: I just vomited.Gillian: An appropriate way to end this.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18635016-the-one
The Scorch Trials;James Dashner;2010;2010;362;3.9;596788;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Post Apocalyptic'];Solving the Maze was supposed to be the end.    Thomas was sure that escape from the Maze would mean freedom for him and the Gladers. But WICKED isn’t done yet. Phase Two has just begun. The Scorch.   There are no rules. There is no help. You either make it or you die.   The Gladers have two weeks to cross through the Scorch—the most burned-out section of the world. And WICKED has made sure to adjust the variables and stack the odds against them.   Friendships will be tested. Loyalties will be broken. All bets are off.    There are others now. Their survival depends on the Gladers’ destruction—and they’re determined to survive.;"During this entire book, I counted how many times Thomas ended up passing out or sleeping either at the end of a chapter or paragraph and did you want to know what the finally count was?

29.





29 times this guy blacked out!! Out of 360 pages, Thomas left you with the cliff hanger of ""and finally he slept"" 29 times. Sounds fun, doesn't it?If this didn't annoy you at all, reread this book (NOT RECOMMENDED) and realize that this dude spent most of his life passed out. Then try to tell me you didn't notice it.Although this book was fast paced, a lot of it was filler and this book could really just have been shrunken into about 100 pages at the max.I gave this book 2 stars only because James Dashner was able to create such real characters by giving them actual human qualities. This is mostly referring to Newt and Minho since they seemed the most real and fleshed out. This compared to other characters like Thomas who had about as much personality and emotion as a burnt piece of rat meat on a stick. He's also about as smart as that which I don't understand since all the Gladers were suppose to be extremely smart children who where put in the maze from the last book because of their high IQs.Apart from the few inconsistencies in this book, the one thing that never made any sense to me was that if everyone in there is suppose to be named after super smart person (like Isaac Newton, etc), then who is Frypan named after? If someone figures it out, please tell me.EDIT: P.S I think I get that Frypan is a nickname now thanks.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7631105-the-scorch-trials
11/22/63;Stephen         King;2011;2010;849;4.34;561465;no;['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Thriller'];On November 22, 1963, three shots rang out in Dallas, President Kennedy died, and the world changed. Unless...In 2011, Jake Epping, an English teacher from Lisbon Falls, Maine, sets out on an insane — and insanely possible — mission to prevent the Kennedy assassination.Leaving behind a world of computers and mobile phones, he goes back to a time of big American cars and diners, of Lindy Hopping, the sound of Elvis, and the taste of root beer.In this haunting world, Jake falls in love with Sadie, a beautiful high school librarian. And, as the ominous date of 11/22/63 approaches, he encounters a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald...;"2012: Go ahead, book snobs. Proclaim haughtily that Stephen King is not Literature. I shall retort with a Pratchett quote, 
""Susan hated Literature. She'd much prefer to read a good book.""
 And nobody argues with Sir Terry.
 (Since 'a picture is worth a thousand words', the above is a three-thousand-words summary of this book. Impressive, no? And also - “dancing is life”.)
As you probably guessed from the not-too-spoiler-sensitive title, 11/22/63 is a book about time travel. My love for it is an exception rather than a rule - you see, I am not usually a fan of the Grandfather paradox. Speaking of which: 
“Yeah, but what if you went back and killed your own grandfather?""He stared at me, baffled. ""Why the fuck would you do that?” 
 As the title proceeds to shamelessly tells us, the book deals with the assassination of John F. Kennedy (and if the title fails to convey the message, then hopefully you - like yours truly - have Google-pedia'd it. Hey, don't judge, I was born in Eastern Europe). Anyway, it's another of Stephen King's 'what if?' situations. What if you could go through a 'rabbit-hole' to the past? Would you try to change history for the better, would you try to right the wrongs? Well, who wouldn't??? And so Jake Epping, an English teacher, sets out to spend half a decade in the past to prevent the assassination of JFK (and to figure out whether Lee Harvey Oswald was indeed the lone gunman that day, despite all the conspiracy theories). 
""As I flipped to the back, I kept seeing that double take. And the grin. A sense of humor; a sense of the absurd. The man in the sixth-floor window of the Book Depository had neither. Oswald had proved it time and again, and such a man had no business changing history.""“Even people capable of living in the past don't really know what the future holds.” 
The question is - what would have happened had JFK survived the assassination that day in Dallas? Would we still have Vietnam War, race riots, and Martin Luther King's death? Could the lives of many innocent people be spared? Could JFK lead the country into a better future? Jake believes so. But what if the past resists the change? What is the price of changing the past? 
""The past is obdurate for the same reason a turtle’s shell is obdurate: because the living flesh inside is tender and defenseless.""
 This book again dispels the long-believed but mistaken axiom that Stephen King is ""just a horror writer"" - of a spook and startle variety. No, in the traditional sense he is not. He knows that the true monsters are those that live inside every one of us (and, ahem, occasionally in Derry, Maine). He has created his own brand of psychological suspense - with the brilliant and scary insight into the minds of average everyday people (who all have some darkness inside them and a skeleton or two in the closet - sometimes quite literally) superimposed onto the masterful description of small towns themselves (eerily resembling sentient living creatures, determined to hold on to their dark secrets). (*) And we get plenty of these in this book, as Jake's quest to prevent that fateful shot in November in Dallas takes him along the way to the small towns of Derry, Maine and Jodie, Texas. 
 * I have an irrational fear of living in a small town, thanks to Stephen King. What if it turns out to be another Derry or Castle Rock?! *shudder*   (By the way, this trip to the past gives plenty of deeeeee-licious 'Easter Eggs' to King's Constant Readers. We see little echoes from Pennywise the Clown era in Derry, meet our favorite 1958 Plymouth Fury (Hellllloooo there, Christine!), and even get a nod to A Wizard and Glass with Takuro Spirit. 
“On that gray street, with the smell of industrial smokes in the air and the afternoon bleeding away to evening, downtown Derry looked only marginally more charming than a dead hooker in a church pew.” 
 Derry of 1958 (right after the terrifying events of IT) is particularly repulsive and sinister. It's a small wonder Jake is able to continue his quest after starting in such an ominous place. But even there King manages to include some unexpected beauty - just remember Richie and Bevvy dancing. And the reverse applies to the idyllic town of Jodie in which Jake is finally able to feel that he actually LIVES in the past. Deep down under the beauty and quaintness lies the ugly little reality. And the same remains true for the Land of Ago, the glorious past of absent airport security, no cholesterol warnings, and everyone happily puffing their way to lung cancers. The 1950s-60s are described with sweetness and nostalgia, but King never hesitates to bluntly remind the reader that the past has teeth and it's not afraid to bite.

King is an excellent writer and an amazing storyteller. His writing is effortless and natural, the characterization is apt and memorable, and the dialogue superb and real-sounding. I truly felt for Jake during each step of his journey. I loved how Oswald was described as not a villain or a nutcase but a flawed broken little man who stumbled into the middle of events that changed history. The other characters - Sadie, Deke, Ellie, Frank Dunning - were so well-written that I could feel them come to life (which actually can be a scary statement when the world of sai King is concerned). The story, despite its sizable length, was flowing along and never lost my attention. And his slow build-up of the sense of suspense and doom - think 
The Yellow Card Man
 (*) and jimla and the 'harmonizing past' - was just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout the book.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pardon me for using this moth-eaten cliche, but Stephen King is like good wine - his writing gets better and better as he ages. Some may consider The Stand his masterpiece (to his dismay - who wants to think he's already reached the peak of his writing career three decades ago???), but I think this book along with “IT” may be it. 
""Is there any phrase more ominous than you need to see exactly what you’ve done? I couldn’t think of one offhand.""
-----------------------------5 stars without hesitation for this excellent impossible-to-put-down book. Sai King, I will continue to be your Constant Reader for hopefully many more years to come, Capital-L Literature or not. 
""If there is love, smallpox scars are as pretty as dimples.""
————————————2022: Rereading my enthusiastic thoughts from a decade ago almost makes me feel like a time traveller myself. Many things have changed since then, but my sincere love for this book remains the same. It’s still wonderful, still so well-written and engaging, and I am thankful to King for being able to bring me that happiness that reading a good book can give you.Still unwavering 5 stars.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10644930-11-22-63

Jason Dessen is walking home through the chilly Chicago streets one night, looking forward to a quiet evening in front of the fireplace with his wife, Daniela, and their son, Charlie—when his reality shatters.""Are you happy with your life?""Those are the last words Jason Dessen hears before the masked abductor knocks him unconscious. Before he awakens to find himself strapped to a gurney, surrounded by strangers in hazmat suits. Before a man Jason's never met smiles down at him and says, ""Welcome back, my friend.""

And Jason is not an ordinary college physics professor, but a celebrated genius who has achieved something remarkable. Something impossible.Is it this world or the other that's the dream? And even if the home he remembers is real, how can Jason possibly make it back to the family he loves? The answers lie in a journey more wondrous and horrifying than anything he could've imagined—one that will force him to confront the darkest parts of himself even as he battles a terrifying, seemingly unbeatable foe.Dark Matter is a brilliantly plotted tale that is at once sweeping and intimate, mind-bendingly strange and profoundly human--a relentlessly surprising science-fiction thriller about choices, paths not taken, and how far we'll go to claim the lives we dream of.";"I suppose we’re both just trying to come to terms with how horrifying infinity really is.
This book made me feel tiny. It was overwhelming and scary, but oh so very gripping too. Dark Matter is the kind of compelling ""I must know WTF is going on"" book that makes you forget about everything else you had to do that day. You step into this world - this absolute mind fuck of a world that will tug at both your heart strings and your brain cells - and you don't want to come out until you know how it ends. Real life? Who cares? Shit is going down and I need answers!I recently read Crouch's Pines and was pretty disappointed. It was a great concept, but I thought the TV show was better and I didn't much like any of the characters. That's not a problem here. Jason Dessen goes through some serious shit and it's hard not to find sympathy for him when his life is ripped apart.After being abducted one night by a masked man, Jason is knocked unconscious and wakes in an unfamiliar place, surrounded by unfamiliar people who all seem to think he's somebody he isn't. What happened to him? Where are his beloved wife and son? These are questions that he will try to answer. But, as he discovers more and more about his situation, he starts to doubt what is real and what is not. Doubt whether he'll ever make it back to his life. Doubt whether it ever even existed at all.
I think, like you, like me, like everyone, she had regrets. I think sometimes she woke up in the night wondering if the path she took was the right one.
And just when you think you got it. When you think you've wrapped your brain around where this book is taking you and what's going on - well, buckle your seat belts, because this ride is about to get a whole lot crazier. In a good way.It's mind-bending and exciting. I felt connected to the book on a personal level because I shared Jason's horror and the fear that he would never make it back to the family he loves. So it was emotionally engaging. But it was also thought-provoking. I could feel my eyes getting wider as I read further into the story.The sort of ""twist"" in the plot is the perfect kind. One of those that I really should have seen coming - it was so obvious! - and yet I didn't. At all. So so good.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27833670-dark-matter
Station Eleven;Emily St. John Mandel;2014;2010;333;4.07;540349;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Adult'];An audacious, darkly glittering novel set in the eerie days of civilization’s collapse—the spellbinding story of a Hollywood star, his would-be savior, and a nomadic group of actors roaming the scattered outposts of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity.Kirsten Raymonde will never forget the night Arthur Leander, the famous Hollywood actor, had a heart attack on stage during a production of King Lear. That was the night when a devastating flu pandemic arrived in the city, and within weeks, civilization as we know it came to an end.Twenty years later, Kirsten moves between the settlements of the altered world with a small troupe of actors and musicians. They call themselves The Traveling Symphony, and they have dedicated themselves to keeping the remnants of art and humanity alive. But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who will threaten the tiny band’s existence. And as the story takes off, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, the strange twist of fate that connects them all will be revealed.;"”Hell is the absence of the people you long for.”When the Georgia Flu sweeps around the world killing 99.6% of the population there were suddenly... a lot of people... to long for. The people missing from our lives is the hardest part. We mourn their loss, but we also have to mourn for the part of ourselves that is lost with each of their passings. To survive is painful. ”Civilization in Year Twenty was an archipelago of small towns. These towns had fought off ferals, buried their neighbors, lived and died and suffered together in the blood-drenched years just after the collapse, survived against unspeakable odds and then only by holding together into the calm…”I’ve met a few survivalists over the years. People who are obsessed with surviving the next great catastrophe. They have food, water, and weapons stockpiled. Some have even went so far as to build bunkers. Everyone of them has looked on me with pity when I admit that I might have a weeks worth of canned food in my house at any one time. They have all kinds of scenarios mapped out that will help insure their survival. They are more than willing to kill people to protect what is theirs. They are living for the end of the world. While they are buying bullets, bottled water, and MRGs I’m spending my money on fine wine, collectible books, and wonderful meals. I want civilization to continue to keep me in a bubble of protection so that I can continue to spend my money on culture for the rest of my days. It so happens that the day before the world ends Arthur Leander, the famous movie actor, is playing a part in King Lear on the stage in Toronto. Dying is never a good thing, but when he drops from a heart attack on stage he has no idea how lucky he is. Kirsten is a child actress in the play and for a very short period of time she will think this is the worst day of her life. In the audience is Jeevan Chaudhary a paramedic trainee who leaps onto the stage and tries to the best of his abilities to save Arthur Leander’s life. Jeevan leaves the theater thinking he has finally discovered what he wants to do with his life. His revelry is interrupted by a phone call from a friend who works in the hospital. The Georgian Flu is in the states and the medical staff have no treatment options. It is killing people faster than they can initiate medical countermeasures. Now most people who get a phone call like this would dither, would maybe even go into denial for a period of time hoping for a miraculous change in the world’s prognosis, but not Jeevan. He goes to the nearest supermarket and buys seven grocery carts filled with food. The image of a man pushing seven carts through the streets of Toronto to his brother Frank’s apartment will stick in my mind forever. Believing the worst... soon enough... saved his life. Kirsten also survives, by luck, by the dint of her adaptability. We find her in the future as part of a travelling theater group. They protect each other and continue to perform the plays of the greatest playwright in the history of the world to what remains of human race. Shakespeare survives. And so do the first and second issues of a comic book series called Dr. Eleven because Arthur Leander’s ex-wife gave him copies of her artistic endeavor and he promptly pressed them into the hands of Kirsten mere hours before he breathed his last. Arthur thought it would entertain his young friend for an hour or so. Little did he know these two comic books would crucially entertain her for decades. The motto of the travelling dramatists is Survival is Insufficient. The blending of Shakespeare and a line now immortalized from Star Trek is exactly how I see the future. In fact, in my household it frequently happens now, the best of the past, blending with the best of the present, everyone must keep up. My kids, now young adults, roll their eyes every time I say “you probably need to google that”. Of course when the world has disappeared and you can entertain children with stories of cool air or warm air just coming out of the vents and they look at you like your telling science-fiction stories; it is overwhelming to think about what has been lost. So what would I miss?One scoop of ice cream, not a bowl full, one scoop because when you only have one scoop you shave off these small bites and savor every one of them. Movies, I can’t even imagine not having movies. For a while I could play the entire movies in my head, but we all know the images will begin to corrode over time and I’ll be left with highlights. Cary Grant running across a field chased by an airplane in North by Northwest. The death scene of Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner. The scene when the king stumbles out wounded but intent on fighting the final battle in The Thirteenth Warrior. Fred Astaire dancing with Ginger Rogers… in that dress... in Top Hat. Marisa Mell frolicking naked in a pile of money in Danger:Diabolik. Marlon Brando saying I coulda been a contender in On the Waterfront. Marilyn Monroe’s skirt blowing up on the subway grate in The Seven Year Itch. John Wayne staring off into the distance over the back of his lathered horse thinking about what he will find in The Searchers. I could go on and on.Hopefully everyone would remember different scenes so we could all remember more. Taking a hot shower. A ritual of thinking that allows me to map out my day while luxuriating in a warm continuous spray. For those who have their entire library on their Kindles, well you are out of luck, but for me the Luddite, I’d be contending with keeping bugs and moisture as far away from my books as possible. Still, books need a controlled environment to continue to be useful so it would be a world with fewer books everyday. Like the movies it may not be that long before many books would only exist in my head. Trains, planes and automobiles. When the world collapses the world would become flat. Global trekking would be more along the lines of seeing what is going on in the next county. I would miss being able to head to Santa Fe, Chicago, or Savannah on a whim. Until I’m there, sitting in all my odoriferous splendor under a tree reading the tattered remains of a copy of War and Peace, it is really hard to say what I would miss the most. Of course the end of the world is never complete without a PROPHET. The troop of dramatists make a swing back through an area where a year earlier they had left two of their members. They had hoped to reconnect with them, but soon discover that they had to move on. A religious element has taken over the region led by a man who is selling the concept of “we are the light”, but really he is saying he is the sun, the moon, and the stars.As a friendly gesture he offers the troop of actors his protection if they donate one of the lovely young ladies from their company to become one of his wives. Why does it always take so long for someone to put a bullet, an arrow, or a knife through a guy like this? The troop politely declines his offer, but soon discover after leaving that they have a twelve year old stowaway who is frantic to escape because she is destined to become The PROPHET’s next wife. Of course THE PROPHET is dissed and it soon becomes a chase as Kristen and her friends try to outrun the ire of a madman. Emily St. John Mandel blends the future and the past together seamlessly around the life of Arthur Leander and how he continues to live in the mind of his young friend Kirsten. Mandel takes this moment in time, the death of Leander on stage, and spreads her tentacles of information backwards and forwards until the reader is captivated by the memories of the past and the people living in this theatrical future. This is an impressive performance from a young writer and now we have to wait to see what form her next novel will assume. ***4.50 out of 5 stars***If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20170404-station-eleven

☆☆☆☆☆5 LEGENDARY STARS!☆☆☆☆☆
You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!Okay so before I start this review I want to say that I missed reading dystopians.The last one I read in June I think and this one reminded me how cool are they,and how much I enjoy this genre.Such a fresh book for these rainy cloudy days.Awesome!____________________________________________

“I don't know if anyone's ever told you this"", he begins. He doesn't blush, and his eyes don't dart away. Instead I find myself staring into a pair of oceans - one perfect, the other blemished by that tiny ripple. ""You're very attractive.""I've been complimented on my appearance before. But never in his tone of voice. Of all the things he's said, I don't know why this catches me off guard. But it startles me so much that without thinking I blurt out, ""I could say the same about you."" I pause. ""In case you didn't know.""A slow grin spreads across his face. ""Oh, trust me. I know.” 

____________________________________________The book was badassy greatly thrilly epic.I enjoyed every bit of it.It was also confusing because when I think about the characters,they are only fifteen and they are like Einstein smart and Bruce Lee strong,and when I was their age I didn't even know how to boil an egg.Way to build my self-esteem.But come on that's why I am a reader.To read about things that seem so unbelievable to achieve,but in the end proving that everything is possible.That's why I love reading.____________________________________________

“You're brilliant,""he says.""But you're a fool to stay with someone like me.""I close my eyes at the touch of his hand.""Then we are both fools.” 

____________________________________________So where to start?...I read this one in 2 days.It's a full action pack filled with thrilling breathtaking scenes,smart decisions,emotions and caring messages.I also enjoyed the romance here.It was different.____________________________________________

“Forever and ever, kid, until you're sick and tired of seeing me.” 

____________________________________________So what I really liked about this book is that the words match characters' age.You don't get to read here about young people quoting like they are 60 years old academics with full degrees,but you have a proper smart fifteen year old conversation between them.Also the way they expressed their emotions and affections it was so awesome,because I was fifteen once and I did the same way(Of course I was not a first class assassin with 1500 points in his trial)____________________________________________

“If you want to rebel, rebel from inside the system.That's much more powerful than rebelling outside the system.” 

____________________________________________The beginning was interesting,like all dystopian books out there,because you get introduced with the world and it's problem and ways they rule things.I must say a lot of dystopians look the same in the beginning to me,because all of them include viruses,or mind controllers,government with people who look nice but they are evil,but I can't complain about that,I enjoyed this book so freaking much.____________________________________________

“The memory fades, and I’m left hanging on to the ghosts of hiswords.” 

____________________________________________The plot if well build.Also the world the author created is awesome and I want to see this book being a movie.It would make a brilliant one,because there are glass breaking,roof jumping,guns and tranquilizer.I mean who doesn't like tranquilizers ,they are like the hipster version of cuffs,because we all know cuffs are way to mainstream.Okay let's not get carried away.As I saw the plot was quite unique and I wouldn't change a thing.____________________________________________

“June has never looked more beautiful than she does now, unadorned and honest, vulnerable yet invincible.” 

____________________________________________The story follows a boy named Day who is the most wanted criminal.Because of his family situation,one day he needs to break in the hospital to get medicine.He does that but heading out he get's in trouble.With officers and guns and everything he manages to get out.Almost at the end of his escape he faces a police captain and to get away he throws a knife to him.He doesn't look back and heads for his sake.In the other side a girl named June is notified that her brother,the captain,was found dead in the hospital and Day is the main suspect.Now she,the girl with the strongest skills,with the highest points in the Trial ever promises to avenge Day,even if it is the last thing she does ____________________________________________

“You try to walk in the light.” 

____________________________________________The characters were awesome described.I like reading about them both.And this was one of the first books I saw an equal between the boy and the girl.They were equal in every way possible.That made the book way more interesting.
June
June was great.A badass beautiful fifteen year old heroine.She is hell of a smartass also,and she sure knows what she is capable of.
Day
Day was also a great character.I liked his sense of humor.He was also strong and too smart for a fifteen year old.____________________________________________

“My mother used to hope that I would rise up from my humble roots. Become someone sucessful, or even famous. I'm famous all right, but I don't think it's what she had in mind.” 

____________________________________________
I recommend this book to every reader out there.Is one of the best books I have read in 2014 and I have read pretty brilliant ones this year.If you want an action pack book with a lot of smart thinking in it , you should pick this up.

Red Rising;Pierce Brown;2014;2010;382;4.27;494452;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Adult'];"""I live for the dream that my children will be born free,"" she says. ""That they will be what they like. That they will own the land their father gave them.""""I live for you,"" I say sadly.Eo kisses my cheek. ""Then you must live for more.""Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations.Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children.But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity already reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. Darrow—and Reds like him—are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class.Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity's overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society's ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies... even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.";"Gah!! Look at the new FairyLoot Editions I got! UPDATE:OMG! Look at the new B&N hardback edition! I can't even people! There is some artwork inside too but the cover!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!When I first read the book I must have been on crack, because it went from 4 stars to 5 and my favorites list! It's bloodydamn awesome! Let me just say the second time around listening to it on audio was fanfreakingtastic! The narrator nails it and there is a song in the book and a woman sings it at the end and I got freaking chills people. Chills! I have my loves: Darrow, Sevro, Mustang, Pax, Roque. There are a few more but those are the mains. I'm going to have to add a few spoilers with excerpts and thoughts. So up goes the big ole banner. Darrow is a Helldiver on Mars. He lives underground digging the earth so other people can live. Oh, the things he doesn't know. His wife Eo is wonderful but she has her own agenda. Below Mars these people are mostly a family. Even though they barely get by with food, etc. The Golds barely give them anything. It's all bullsh*t but we won't go there. 
The first thing you should know about me is I am my father's son. And when they came for him, I did as he asked. I did not cry. Not when the Society televised the arrest. Not when the Golds tried him. Not when the Grays hanged him. Mother hit me for that. My brother Kieran was supposed to be the stoic one. He was the elder, I was the younger. I was supposed to cry. Instead, Kieran bawled like a girl when Little Eo tucked a haemanthus into Father's left workboot and ran back to her own father's side. My sister Leanna murmured a lament beside me. I just watched and thought it a shame that he died dancing but without his dancing shoes. On Mars there is not much gravity. So you have to pull the feet to break the neck. They let the loved ones do it.
If any of the people do anything wrong they are killed. I hate the Golds so much! The evil ones at any rate. One sad day Eo takes Darrow to a forbidden place so he can see they are living a lie. So he can see the true world. And . . . they were caught. They were both to be flogged and they were but Eo decides to sing the song of death. And what that means is it is a forbidden song and any who sing it will be hanged. 
But never has Eo been more beautiful to me than in that moment. In the face of cold power, she is fire. This is the girl who danced through the smoky tav with a mane of red. This is the girl who wove me a wedding band of her own hair. This is the girl who chooses to die for a song of death. My love, my loveRemember the criesWhen winter died for spring skiesThey roared and roared But we grabbed our seedAnd sowed a songAgainst their greedAnd Down in the valeHear the reaper swing, the reaper swingthe reaper swingDown in the valeHear the reaper sing A tale of winter doneMy son, my sonRemember the chainsWhen gold ruled with iron reins We roared and roared And twisted and screamed For ours, a vale of better dreams""Yes,"" the ArchGovernor says idly. ""I have an appointment with Arcos. Hang the rusty bitch lest she continue to howl.""""Live for more,"" she mouths to me. she reaches into her pocket and pulls out the haemanthus I gave her. It is smashed and flat. Then loudly she screams to all those gathered, ""Break the chains!""
Darrow had to pull her legs to break her neck. It was heartbreak, utter heartbreak. The jerks would never let them take down the loved ones that were hanged. They left them there to rot and then crushed them to dust when they were skeletons. Darrow would not let this happen to Eo. He took her down and buried her. As he was to be hanged for this, something else happened. He did not die. He was drugged and taken to an order of Reds that are fighting back against the system. Darrow is turned from a Red into a Gold. This means tremendous pain that many do not live through. Changing the brain, changing the bone structure, muscle mass, eyes . . . but Darrow's body was strong even though it was weak from his living conditions. 
The Elderwomen of Lykos say that when a man is bitten by a pitviper, all the poison must be drawn out of the bite, for the poison is wicked. When I was bitten, Uncle Narol left some in on purpose.
After months of healing and learning to be a Gold, Darrow is taken and given tests to see if he can get into the Golds school to become something of himself. In reality, to kill them all! Darrow passes and is picked by the House Mars and he is to fight with them against other houses. There can only be so many that win. The boys and girls go through some horrific things. Many lose their lives. But it's so bloodydamn good! They are ruthless and do what they have to do. No, many of them don't want to do these things but they have to do it. Darrow has to do it for Eo and for the Reds and all they have lost over the years by all of the lies. Darrow is knows as the Reaper....This is a freaking awesome book and I will read it many times. There are only a few things in the book I don't like, but there is always that! I leave you with the full song from the book: 
  Listen, listenRemember the waneOf sun's fury and waving grainWe fell and fellAnd danced alongTo croon a knellOf rights and wrongsAnd My son, my son Remember the burnWhen leaves were fire and seasons turnedWe fell and fellAnd sang a songTo weave a cellAll autumn longAnd Down in the vale Hear the reaper swing, the reaper swingthe reaper swingDown in the valeHear the reaper singA tale of winter longMy girl, my girlRemember the chillWhen rains froze and snows did killWe fell and fellAnd danced alongThrough icy hellTo their winter songMy love, my loveRemember the criesWhen winter died for spring skiesThey roared and roaredBur we grabbed our seedAnd sowed a songAgainst their greedMy son, my sonRemember the chainsWhen gold ruled with iron reignsWe roared and roared And twisted and screamedFor ours, a valeof better dreamsAnd Down in the vale Hear the reaper swing, the reaper swingthe reaper swing.Down in the valeHear the reaper singA tale of winter done.
Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List****Old Review****For whatever reason I loved the first part of the book better then the last part. I thought it was going to be a cool underground Mars weird thing. I'm the weird thing, I know. =)I loved Darrow and a lot of other characters but I never wrote any down but Darrow. Omg! I don't know what is wrong with me. Why can't I remember them, uh, because most of them I can't even pronounce, much less think of how to spell them! I loved that Darrow was a Helldiver <--- that so doesn't sound right! He and his colony of Reds dig into Mars inner layers to get what the world needs to survive. Well, guess what? He finds out that the world don't need saving, Mars is totally livable! There are all kinds of colors on in this world and I'm not going into all of them because they have a lot but the ones that are jerks are the Golds. (I don't like that color anyway)By the hands of the Golds and Darrow's wife Eo's decision, Darrow's fate has been sealed for him. He is taken into the world. THE WORLD and he is changed to become a Gold and infiltrate their evilness and TAKE THEM DOWN! Like I said in one of my updates that Darrow went through some serious Frankenstein stuff. Okay, not seriously LIKE Frankenstein but some pretty messed up stuff to turn from a Red to a Gold. Who knew? Then he gets put into tests to get into school and hopefully get on a ship or something cool where he can be a big man to do big things. But, the kids are put through some grueling things in order to see who is going to be some of the top contenders. It was pretty messed up but life is generally messed up in one way or another. I really hope to enjoy the rest of this trilogy. I'm interested to read what's going to happen now that Darrow is . . . well I can't tell you that, but lets just say he is within reach of the person he wants to end most in the world!

Delirium;Lauren Oliver;2011;2010;441;3.95;470378;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Teen'];"There is an alternate cover edition for this ISBN13 here.In an alternate United States, love has been declared a dangerous disease, and the government forces everyone who reaches eighteen to have a procedure called the Cure. Living with her aunt, uncle, and cousins in Portland, Maine, Lena Haloway is very much looking forward to being cured and living a safe, predictable life. She watched love destroy her mother and isn't about to make the same mistake.But with ninety-five days left until her treatment, Lena meets enigmatic Alex, a boy from the ""Wilds"" who lives under the government's radar. What will happen if they do the unthinkable and fall in love?";"Around page 30(ish) there is a line in the book that I really could not get past and I nearly put the book down because of it. “His eyes are literally dancing with light, burning as though on fire.” This is what I pictured:I am positive that eyeballs (literally) doing a cha-cha with light bulbs is not is not what Oliver meant to portray. I am also pretty sure, given the context, that this statement was not intended as hyperbole. Now see here, I am normally not a grammar stickler, but this lapse in judgment, I think calls for a public flogging of either the author or the editor. Possibly both. Have I mentioned before that I really hate writing negative reviews? It is so much easier to rant and rave about how wonderful a book is, than it is to point out all the problems I had with it. Just saying. The original concept of this book was at first compelling and interesting. The idea that love is a disease that has, in the near future, been cured. The fact that love has been classified as ""the most deadly of deadly things"" and that the government is sanctioning and actually requiring all citizens to undergo a lobotomy at the age of 18. After which they will be assigned a mate. The original concept is a bit incredible, but I am actually ok with “incredible” as long as it is portrayed in a believable way. And for the most part, it was. As the book progressed however, I kept finding undeniable parallels to Matched and Uglies. I found Lena, our protagonist and narrator, mostly weak, annoying, and infuriating. For example, there is a point in the book where Lena is caught with her love Alex, and consequentially is tied up in her room by her family. She is counting down the hours until her forced “procedure” and contemplating suicide.  At this point Lena actually compares herself to (paraphrased) ’the princesses in the fairytales … waiting for her prince to rescue her’. Sorry, but, that about induced vomiting. -And I mean that in the best possible way. The narrative voice is flowing, steady, and easy to follow. It was just interesting enough to keep you reading to find out what happens next.Believe it or not I actually really liked the ending. If there is a single redeeming virtue in Delirium, this is it. I am not sure if I liked the ending because one of the annoying characters was brutally eliminated from the plot in a bloody and melodramatic fashion (I am joking) or more likely, because it seemed somewhat fitting with the whole Romeo and Juliet theme that the author kept hinting at. It was also marginally unexpected, which is always a good thing. I have put the next book on hold at the library, I am not sure if I will read it or not at this point. I can see how some people would really like this book, but it just wasn’t for me. I couldn’t possibly give it a higher rating than a 3.If you are a fan of sappy teenage romance books you would probably enjoy Delirium. EDIT: I want to add, because this review is getting so many “likes” that if you want to read something that is very good by Oliver; please check out Liesl and Po. It is stellar.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11614718-delirium
The 5th Wave;Rick Yancey;2013;2010;457;4.01;463504;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Aliens', 'Romance'];After the 1st wave, only darkness remains. After the 2nd, only the lucky escape. And after the 3rd, only the unlucky survive. After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one. Now, it's the dawn of the 5th wave, and on a lonely stretch of highway, Cassie runs from Them. The beings who only look human, who roam the countryside killing anyone they see. Who have scattered Earth's last survivors. To stay alone is to stay alive, Cassie believes, until she meets Evan Walker. Beguiling and mysterious, Evan Walker may be Cassie's only hope for rescuing her brother—or even saving herself. But Cassie must choose: between trust and despair, between defiance and surrender, between life and death. To give up or to get up.;"“If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn't turn out very well for the Native Americans.” - Stephen HawkingSometimes, I am lucky enough to get my hands on an ARC of a book and go into it with as close to no expectations as possible. I haven't read any reviews before, so the first experience is entirely my own, as I find it. And sometimes I love these books. Sometimes I give them 4 or 5 star reviews, rated purely based on the emotional high I experienced. I am an emotional reader and an emotional rater afterall. Sometimes these books get read by a few people and disappear, and sometimes they take off and become huge, gaining ever more praise and criticism. It is this latter experience that always has a strange effect on me.Because, when I read The 5th Wave, I enjoyed it immensely. Enough, even, to write a song, with my sister, inspired by it. I thought it was atmospheric and perfectly creepy. I could sense the distrust and fear in the air. But later, after time had passed and the immediate emotional effect had waned, I was reading the negative reviews and felt somewhat... embarrassed by my part in the hype.Was it really that good? To deserve all this hype? Is any book ever that good? Should I have been more critical? Should I be embarrassed by my gushy, bright-eyed emotional response? I feel this way about so many books that I rave about early and that become huge later. An Ember in the Ashes is another good example. People say they don't understand the hype, that The 5th Wave doesn't even deserve to be classed as science-fiction, that it is - literally - ""the worst book I have ever read"". And I find myself, post-emotional response, agreeing to many things said.Is The 5th Wave really that original? I guess not. Is it so mind-blowing that it deserved all that gushy praise I gave it? Maybe it wasn't. Look at it for what it is and can you honestly say it's that good? Probably not.And yet, I read it again, knowing what I did not know the first time around. I read it and I once again felt that atmosphere of loneliness, sadness and distrust. It's not a logical thing and it might not make sense to a lot of people, but it pulls me so entirely inside this book.Maybe emotional responses don't hold up under a critical eye. Maybe this book doesn't objectively deserve the praise I heap upon it. All I know is that for a little while, this book took me completely out of this world and affected me enough that I wanted to gush and praise and write a song.I won't offer promises of originality or great science-fiction. I'll just stand as an example of someone who read this book in 2013 and again now and, for whatever reason, loved it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16101128-the-5th-wave
The Death Cure;James Dashner;2011;2010;325;3.78;461897;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Post Apocalyptic'];It’s the end of the line. WICKED has taken everything from Thomas: his life, his memories, and now his only friends—the Gladers. But it’s finally over. The trials are complete, after one final test. Will anyone survive? What WICKED doesn’t know is that Thomas remembers far more than they think. And it’s enough to prove that he can’t believe a word of what they say. The truth will be terrifying. Thomas beat the Maze. He survived the Scorch. He’ll risk anything to save his friends. But the truth might be what ends it all.  The time for lies is over.;"This book was- *wait a moment*Let me bang my head until the author proves that there is one more book to be published for us readers, or if this book was just a really, really good joke.Omigosh. Do not tell me that this is the last book of this trilogy. Do not tell me that the author just didn't answer all the questions we were waiting for. And please do not freaking tell me that this is what we readers are getting after being such a fan of both The Maze Runner and Scorch Trials books.After happily reading The Scorch Trails and then excitedly waiting for this book for about 6 months, I yet again screamed with happiness (as I also did with another book Bloodlines) when I got to read it. The story started with a good potential, it was interesting, I was feeling it. I was reading it non-stop and then suddenly in the middle of no where I am like, ""WTH is going on?""FAIL 1: CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS!I do believe Thomas here just had this emotion for everything.""He was my close friend""From deaths to betrayals to everything, he just considered every living human being as a friend. Come on! He could act like he loved people or atleast cared about someone just more than friends. And don't even get me started on Teresa. To be totally honest, Teresa is just like a random stranger on the road I see everyday. I am either proud or totally miserable to say that I don't know her at all. She came and she went and I was just like, ""Pfft. Whatever.""And then Brenda. Weren't you just a side ass character introduced in the second book? Then honey, why? WHY are you the main heroine here? The only character I liked? Minho, Jorge and Newt.Minho for being the best of the best, Jorge for always being there and Newt for never giving up. The story till Newt was awesome.FAIL 2: Y U GIVE SO MANY DEATHS?Now readers who didn't read this book might find this fail spoiler-ish. First of all. Death of Newt. I think it was the most sensible one. I felt for that guy and I am so happy to say that James Dashner did a really good job in his ending. In simple words, I loved it.But, then comes Teresa. What.the.hell? She was the main heroine! How in the world can you kill the main heroine and replace her with a side kick? I do NOT approve this.And then 300 people killed out of 500? Ouch. That was a bit unfair. Atleast the author could have saved 300-50 something people.I miss Chuck. =[FAIL 3: WHERE ARE MY FREAKING ANSWERS?How could this book even end without satisfying the readers?(1)I wanted Thomas to his memory back so we could learn exactly what he and Teresa did before the Trials and why were they specifically chosen. Hell, I even wanted Minho's and Newt's memories back and Brenda's past.(2) How in the world did they end up in a green paradise with a hundred or so immunes so they can start over? Umm, hello? What about the rest of the freaking world?(3) Who is this Paige Chancellor? Why didn't she go to paradise with them? I love James Dashner's writing, I liked the book, don't get me wrong but I am really amazed at people who gave this book 5/5 stars. I am very sad to say this but yes, overall, this book didn't satisfy me and I am disappointed. Especially after being the last book of such an amazing series. But then, I will still miss the characters and this story will stay with me forever and always. 3/5 stars.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7864437-the-death-cure
The Testaments;Margaret Atwood;2019;2010;422;4.19;363689;yes;['Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Feminism', 'Audiobook', 'Classics', 'Adult'];"When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of The Handmaid's Tale, readers had no way of telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.With The Testaments, the wait is over.Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.In this brilliant sequel to The Handmaid's Tale, acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have tantalized readers for decades.""Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in."" --Margaret AtwoodAn alternate cover edition of ISBN 978-0385543781 can be found here.";I guess I'll have to be the one who says what nobody else is willing to say. This novel is terrible, and Booker judges are starstruck, hype-driven sellouts. And that no professional literary critic has the guts to tell the truth about how poorly conceived and written The Testaments is, is a true shame.  I can't decide which work Atwood should be embarrassed for more - Angel Catbird, Vol. 1 or The Testaments. The book doesn't read like a novel written by one of the most lauded authors of the 20st century. The Testaments reads like a standard-issue feminist YA dystopia, filled with every overused dystopian trope and every stereotype, penned by an author who writes for teen audience, and is published by Harper Teen. As such, it undoubtedly has some appeal to a part of Atwood's readership, but literary merit The Testaments has none. If this book had a different name on it, I would have DNFed it after 50 pages for its lack of originality, predictability and mediocre writing style. I’ve read a fair number of similar novels, I am not opposed to them, I enjoyed some of them, and some of them (for example the upcoming The Grace Year) held my attention much better. As an Atwood novel, The Testaments gets one disappointed, angry, heart-broken star from me. Why did the publishers embargo Atwood's new creation, I wonder? Surely there is nothing to spoil. Maybe to conceal its poor execution, or its transparent, shallow, simplistic, and ridiculous plot? The story is told from 3 POVs - Aunt Lydia's and two teen girls' - one growing up in Gilead and another - in Canada. Oh my, who those girls might be? Twist! You can only glimpse Atwood's former brilliance in Aunt Lydia's POV, but just for a few moments here and there. If the whole novel was written about Aunt Lydia, maybe Atwood would have made her journey more convincing, but alas. The other two girls are quintessential YA dystopian heroines - one abused by an evil oppressive regime, and the other - a bratty teen on the run from bad people, but who nevertheless has time for some romance. Yum! Like I said, these POVs are so similar to what's been regurgitated over and over in teen publishing, it's uncanny. Has The Testaments been partially ghost-written by Lauren Oliver? I am not trying to dump on Oliver, she has her fans and her place in the industry, but I expected something infinitely more sophisticated from Margaret Atwood.The new information about Gilead Atwood promised? Well, new details of Gilead made the regime more nonsensical and less plausible than ever before. Who benefits from living in Gilead becomes unfathomable in this book, thus making the entire concept pointless (kind of like in Wither). Totalitarian regimes work, at least temporarily, because they are supported by a mass of true believers. Where are they in this book? But if you yearn for some more torture porn in addition to that supplied by the 3 seasons of the TV show, then sure. Rapists, molesters, killers, suicide victims galore, plus solitary confinement - there is an overabundance of that. All of it written bluntly, rashly, exploitatively and without any kind of nuance. There is no overarching theme in The Testaments except GILEAD IS BAD. The plot to overthrow it is a joke. If you are looking for a clever, thoughtful, well-written companion to The Handmaid's Tale, you are out of luck. If you want a bland, basic TV show fanfic stuffed with action adventure and genre tropes, enjoy! The Testaments was written just for you.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42975172-the-testaments
I Am Number Four;Pittacus Lore;2010;2010;440;3.93;344550;yes;['Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Aliens', 'Romance', 'Paranormal'];Nine of us came here. We look like you.

Thank God this book didn't live up to its hype like Twilight did. At least I hope it didn't because I don't really hear much about this one. I couldn't get past chapter nine. It was such a bloody bore. I decided to give it time for me to find that little ""spark."" But, no. Now here are the problems:1. Lore can't use the word ""and"" in the proper way. Which seems like it's not a big of a deal, but it is! He randomly places it and tries to get his readers to understand his reading and it's quite awful. 2. The characters are all bland and pathetic. John seems to have a false sense of bravado. Henri makes me want to bang my head against the wall. And don't get me started on Sarah. The characters are so emotionless. No depth. 3. Lore tends to forget the most significant details regarding his plot. It's like, ""OH I FORGOT TO MENTION WHAT MY POWERS ARE!"" ""OH, WAIT! MY NAME IS ---""4. His writing is dull and boring in every possible way. It reminds me of Fitzgerald's writing.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7747374-i-am-number-four
Golden Son;Pierce Brown;2015;2010;466;4.47;299806;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Adult'];As a Red, Darrow grew up working the mines deep beneath the surface of Mars, enduring backbreaking labor while dreaming of the better future he was building for his descendants. But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within. A lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals. To wage and win the war that will change humankind’s destiny, Darrow must confront the treachery arrayed against him, overcome his all-too-human desire for retribution—and strive not for violent revolt but a hopeful rebirth. Though the road ahead is fraught with danger and deceit, Darrow must choose to follow Eo’s principles of love and justice to free his people. He must live for more.;"Take all these 5/5 stars ratings from me, Pierce Brown. Take it! You completely deserve it. Unbelievable… It wasn’t an exaggeration when practically everyone told me the sequels to Red Rising are much better. Golden Son was an absolutely magnificent installment in the trilogy. I praised Red Rising, I enjoyed reading it so much. And still, it pales in comparison to its sequel. I started reading Golden Son on the day I turned 28, I finished it in three days, and I’m so lucky to have chosen this book to be my first read in my new age.
“I will die. You will die. We will all die and the universe will carry on without care. All that we have is that shout into the wind - how we live. How we go. And how we stand before we fall.”
There is a new contender for the biggest lie I've ever heard, seeing Golden Son shelved under the YA section. I was reluctant to start this series because of it (YA books don't click with me often), and I am truly glad the incorrect shelving did not stop me from reading this series. Forget all the similarities with other YA books you think you have seen or heard in Red Rising; you won’t find any of them here. Golden Son completely goes into adult military sci-fi/space-opera territory, and it is written like one. No sugar coating; there were a lot of harsh words, bloodbaths, brutality, and gore scenes here. Unless your 13 old kids have their maturity tempered with Thor’s hammer, I recommend you make them stay away from this book. It is up to you, in the end, though. Who knows? Maybe your kids will learn how to defy their bullies with Lego after reading this book since there were a lot of strategies and badassery involved here.Whether you’re one of those who loved (like me) or hated the previous book, I’ll assure you Golden Son organically launched the series in a different direction than before, and it’s so much better. It relies on the foundation laid by the first book to hurl the plot and setting of the series to become a massive sci-fi and space opera (literally from page 1) series. Packed with non-stop actions, thrilling politics, bloody space or ground warfare, and twists and turns, Golden Son is designed to grip readers from the beginning until the end. Seriously, only a few chapters with brief respites were given before the narrative pulled you back into all the madness and blood feud again.Have I mentioned the ending was so mind-blowing, too? It felt like it was crafted to give you an anxiety attack. I strongly recommend you to have MORNING STAR beside you before you finished the book. It’s probably one of the most brutal cliffhangers I have ever experienced in my whole life. In fact, I’m actually typing this review after I read the first two chapters of Morning Star straight after finishing Golden Son. Otherwise, this review will consist only of me typing my foamy mouth into words: “argh urgh fruha euehoqo dsuhckijk quhaorj uhjqpkco”Frankly, I did not expect to get attached to the characters in this book this much when I started reading the series, but now I do, I really do. I am a sucker for terrific character development. I love when there is an improvement in the character's personality, strengths, weaknesses, and the changes in all their relationships. Whether they are in the form of love blossomed or betrayal inflicted, as long as they are executed superbly and believably, I will never get tired of them, and this book has them all.Picture: Darrow by PhantomRinAlso, plenty of incredible new characters were introduced in Golden Son, such as Ragnar Volarus, Victra, and Lorn. But if I have to choose, my favorite part will be seeing the relationship development between Darrow and his best friends, old and new, especially Sevro. The friendship between Darrow and Sevro is what I love to call a friendship goal. They understand each other, bantered carelessly, and most importantly, their loyalty to each other was unbending. Sadly, I can’t elaborate more on this part this time as there were a lot of factors and scenes that I think would be much better for you to experience yourself rather than hearing them from me. However, I will assure you and let you know that Darrow and Sevro were my favorite characters in the book for me.I mentioned before in my Red Rising review that I absolutely loved Pierce Brown’s writing, it still holds true here, in fact, I love it even more now as I really think he really improved his writing style. It’s much more engrossing, immersive, poetic and yet still retained all the previous elements that captivated me.Picture: Sevro’s re-introduction by Justin WongThe world-building scale in Golden Son was bigger and better than before, and now, we're dealing with space travel and world hopping. It felt easier to read and visualize, in my opinion, compared to Red Rising. The necessary foundational lore and world-building information were established already in Red Rising. One of the minor issues I had with Red Rising was how the setting felt like they were on Earth even though they were not. But not this time. In my Red Rising review, I mentioned that I absolutely loved Pierce Brown’s prose. And this notion holds true here. In fact, I love it even more now. There were clear signs of improvement in the quality of storytelling and prose. The narrative felt much more engrossing, immersive, and poetic. And still, it somehow retained all the previous elements that captivated me.There were also a lot of great one-liners and fantastic quotes to give you hope, laughter, or something to think about when you go through the book. Here are some of my favorites:
“Home isn't where you're from, it's where you find light when all grows dark.”

“Friendships take minutes to make, moments to break, years to repair.”

""I'm Gold, bitch. What'd you expect? Warm milk and cookies just because I'm pocket sized?”
Adrenaline inducement was imminent, words you read will shoot straight to your heart and fill your feelings with love towards the main and side characters. But rage and hatred towards the villains. Betrayals, bloodydamn epic actions, and military warfare (both ground and space warfare) sequence were written so vividly. It felt like I’m experiencing a much more epic and gritty version of Star Wars or Star Trek. Yes, I said that. Deal with it.I’m putting Golden Son into my favorite shelves. Golden Son is everything I ever want in a sci-fi novel. Pierce Brown said this is his favorite book out of the trilogy, and I honestly don’t think Morning Star can top this. But hey, that remains to be seen. I can say with confidence, though, if Morning Star didn’t disappoint, this series is bound to become one of my favorite series of all time.I urge you strongly to start this series if you love any sci-fi, space opera, tension-packed actions, fantastic climax sequence, and terrific characterizations with a strong plot and pacing. Or, if you’re eager to get your adrenaline dose, let me tell you that you don’t need to ride an extreme roller coaster to get it. Look no further, just read Golden Son, and you will get all these experiences for hours. I may sound calm in my review, but deep inside my burning heart, I’m typing this review with fingers full of adrenaline rush from the non-stop “one more chapter” syndrome this book gave me. This book is the kind of drug and escapism I need in this world when sometimes, we need a portal to escape from our boring reality, and I bloodydamn hope you will experience this as well.You can order this book from: Blackwells (Free International shipping)You can find the rest of my reviews at Novel Notions | I also have a Booktube channelSpecial thanks to my Patrons on Patreon for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Andrew, Andrew W, Annabeth, Casey, Diana, Dylan, Edward, Elias, Ellen, Ellis, Gary, Hamad, Helen, Jesse, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Kristina, Lana, Leigh, Luis, Lufi, Melinda, Meryl, Michael, Miracle, Nanette, Neeraja, Nicholas, Radiah, Reno, Samuel, Sarah, Sarah, Scott, Shawn, Xero, Wendy, Wick, Zoe.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18966819-golden-son
The Institute;Stephen         King;2019;2010;561;4.2;288828;no;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Science Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery'];In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.”In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute.As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is Stephen King's gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good versus evil in a world where the good guys don't always win.--front flap;KING of the writers just released a book and I started my Single ladies/Staying alive combination happy dance, grabbed it into my hands and started my ritual I do when I start a new King book. My ritual is simple. I pray for several things starting with better eyesight (Dear King always like to write encyclopedic sized books which I also used in my training sessions. I lift “The Stand” and “Dark Tower series” 50 times till my arms turned into jellies but now I got an amazing look. Some people confused me with woman wrestlers! Damn it!) and my healthy soul (probably I sold to the devil because I’m biggest fan of his fantastic villains. Randal Flagg, Jack Torrence, George Stark, Blaine the Mono were my dream quadruple! I visualized them start villain poker tournaments!) and healthy throat and ears! ( I was 10 when I started to read my first king Book and I was at my school chorus practice, hiding my book in my music notes but instead of singing that day, I was reading and then I started screaming. I terrorized my friends and teachers that day! So I found my life mission already, thanks to Mr. King) As a summary, it is the toughest thing to start a new King book because he’s definitely my favorite writer. In 30 years, I left the country I was born, I cut drinking Coke ( because I moved to NYC and its Coke tastes the worst!), I stopped eating cakes instead of I addicted to Chardonnay and cupcakes! I got married and I resigned from my bank manager job to be screenplay writer (Yes! Everybody knows something is wrong with me!) after moving to L.A, learned fake smiling and not to scream when I see at a walking talking over tanned and botoxed Barbie doll. So many things changed, life molded me, tormented me, punched me but also gave so many gifts to me. But ONLY ONE THING in 30 years didn’t change: I resumed reading KING books and loved them wholeheartedly. So becoming objective and not putting your fingers on your keyboard to give gazillion FIVE SHINY STARS is one of the hardest test I have to pass!   Let's go back to talk about this book: in first few pages, I thought I started the wrong book because it seemed like Tim Jaimeson’s story, was ex officer at Sarasota and left his job, left his seat to a FBI agent, hitchhiking and found himself DuPray applying “Night Knocker” job. His story is hooked me up from the beginning. I thought I read another plot but that’s okay, I loved this story so much reminded me of old school King books.   But then next chapter, everything changed and we’re introduced to highly intelligent, gifted Luke’s story and his kidnapping. One night he found himself at the copied version his own room (but the copiers might have forgotten to add windows!) And the wonder kids of INSTITUTE story began!  I felt like somebody dragged Mr. King away from his keyboard while he’s writing this book and Duffer Brothers sat on his seat to create crueler version of Stranger Things with meaner adults and gifted but a little unlikable kids version. (I only resonated with Avery but he’s not Dustin!)  There are too many references to King’s older works on this book. Even the twins reminded you of Shining’s creepy twins Lisa and Louise Burns!) There are too kind of extraordinary kinds here: The kids who are telepaths or telekinetic! To differentiate them they have to find the ones seeing the dots! We don’t have Carrie White but Avery’s character was a little reminded us Danny Torrence who has its shining.  I missed his characters’ connections and growing friendship I’ve read on other books (his story “Body”, It, even at Dark Tower series was about different people’s connection) I found this one a little flat, dull, more artificial. And the vulgarity, harshness the kids endured and the illegal, ruthless test methods the institute crew applied on them DISTURBED me so much. I can handle the violence. I’m die-hard Tarantino fan but when it comes to innocent kids, this kind of torturing methods churned my stomach! ( I wish I could puke on all the villains of the book!) This time their methods put me on edge and I made a waterboarding list instead of slapping because other villains of the books seemed like Disney characters comparing with these nasty scumbags! Of course honor member of my hating list is starting with Mrs. Sigsby (what kind of last name is this?) and Tony! I think I should put all the crew members of institute including Maureen because snitches are always the worst!  As a summary: because of its longevity, it’s not a fast reading, but it’s still intriguing, you never got bored. It’s quite a page-turner, riveting, nerve bending, surprising book. Even though there are too many references of his older books, writing was a little different from King’s usual style and the things the little kids fought against made me sad and frustrated. So I decided to stick with shiny four stars! It’s still a remarkable, smart-written, good book but not one of the best works of KING OF WRITERS!Okay, now I started to FLOAT! I think Mr. King might feel I cut the last star! I wish I drank my last sip of Chardonnay before being punished. Well, all work no play make Nily dull person!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43798285-the-institute
Winter;Marissa Meyer;2015;2010;827;4.42;288225;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Retellings', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook'];Princess Winter is admired for her grace, kindness and beauty, despite the scars on her face. She's said to be even more breath-taking than her stepmother, Queen Levana...When Winter develops feelings for the handsome palace guard, Jacin, she fears the evil Queen will crush their romance before it has a chance to begin.But there are stirrings against the Queen across the land. Together with the cyborg mechanic, Cinder, and her allies, Winter might even find the power to launch a revolution and win a war that's been raging for far too long.Can Cinder, Scarlet, Cress, and Winter claim their happily ever afters by defeating Levana once and for all?;"“She was prettier than a bouquet of roses and crazier than a headless chicken. Fitting in was not an option.”
And... I've finished! *sob*The last few weeks have been a whirlwind of Lunar Chronicles. After finally giving in and picking up Scarlet, even though I hated Cinder, I just haven't been able to get enough of this series. And this longass final installment was a heart-pounding, fast-paced finale.You know, I actually checked and this is the longest YA book I have ever read at over 820 pages, the second longest being Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix at 766 pages. I was a bit concerned seeing as I generally think any YA book over 500 pages feels too long, but I needn't have worried. I flew through this monster.I've come to the conclusion that I really like how Meyer balances retelling with the traditional story. She gets the amount of each just right, changing up enough to keep it surprising and exciting, but slotting in many parallels to the original stories that often catch me by surprise and make me smile.I also love how far the relationships have come. Lots of funny and touching dynamics, lots of great friendships to remind us that romance isn't everything. In Winter, I loved the title character so much. In addition to the brave, level-headed Cinder, the fiery Scarlet, and the sweet, intelligent Cress, we now have Ms beautiful and crazy. Each character is very different, but important in her own way, and together they make a funny, lovable team.The book wraps up very well, delivering a dramatic and bloody climax. There are many close calls, lots of action, and lots of crazy. As I've said about the previous two books: this might not be great literature, but it sure is a rush of wild excitement.And can we all just take a moment to talk about how great Thorne is? I compared him to Gilderoy Lockhart in my review of the last book and he is still my favourite character. He's just so hilarious and ridiculous... in the best way.
Thorne scoffed. “Careful is my middle name. Right after Suave and Daring.”“Do you even know what you're saying half the time?” asked Cinder.***“A kiss from the Captain would probably melt my central processor.”Thorne winked at her. “Oh trust me. It would.”

But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something...unexpected happens.The hot alien living next door marks me.You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities, and Daemon's touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way I'm getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades.If I don't kill him first, that is.Read the entire bestselling series!#1: Obsidian (from Katy's point of view)#2: Onyx (from Katy's point of view)#3: Opal (from Katy's point of view)#4: Origin#5: OppositionOblivion (Books 1-3 from Daemon's point of view) CAN BE READ FIRST OR AFTER KATY'S POV! Shadows (Dawson's story);"Not long ago, someone I know got into a really bad relationship. It was the kind of relationship where the guy was a pretty-faced douchebag who would tell her he loved her one minute and the next he would be making snide remarks about her weight and about her career, or standing her up when they were supposed to be going somewhere. But the worst part of this relationship wasn't him, it was my friend. Everyone she knew, including me, warned her away from him, told her he was bad and that she deserved better... you know, the usual. And she knew exactly who he was, knew that he was playing constant mind games. But she honestly believed that what she put up with was a worthy sacrifice for love. And she honestly believed she could change him. She would say ""he's just an immature guy"" as we sat with her while she cried because he'd made her feel like shit again. We subtly tried to remind her that there was such a thing as self respect and she was rapidly losing grip on it. I sat there and wondered how someone so pretty, smart and full of fiery personality could truly believe this was something normal that she had to accept and get through. But it's when I read books like Obsidian that I receive a painful reminder that this kind of psychology is not only way too frequent, but also constantly reinforced by books selling such relationships as romantic and passionate. Do I need to point out the obvious example?Some people said this book was another Twilight - complete with sappy heroine, paranormal love interest and a shit ton of angst. Honestly, they insulted Twilight with that one. Give me that creepy creeper called Edward Cullen any day over this rude, arrogant piece of work. I'm pretty sure Edward was actually kinda nice to Bella in his weird archaic ""I won't shag you before marriage but I will sneak into your room and watch you sleep because that is totally acceptable and normal"" way. Daemon, on the other hand, is an arrogant and downright RUDE dickwad. I'm not even going to pretend to understand the attraction because I don't see it. 'kay, he's beautiful, whatever. He also talks to the MC like she's crap he just stepped in, whilst interspersing the abuse with heated kisses and whatnot. There is nothing, NOTHING attractive to me about making out with a guy who insults me and acts like I'm worth less than nothing. I don't get it.The heroine - Katy - isn't terrible. She has high points where she pulls out some well-placed snark AND she's a book blogger - woohoo! But she has plenty of eye roll-worthy Mary Sue moments where she frets about her obvious beauty. In the first chapter (I think) she describes herself in a way that is supposed to imply she is somehow plain - with ""curvy hips, puffy lips and huge eyes"". So... she has big eyes, full lips and curves. Yeah, we really feel your pain, Katy.I realise I just basically trashed a book that tops a lot of people's favourite lists - sorry. I am currently working my way through some popular YA that I always meant to read but never did, so that's how I crossed paths with this book after avoiding it for so long. But yeah, guess you figured out this one wasn't for me :)Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr | Youtube";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195790629-obsidian
Artemis;Andy Weir;2017;2010;305;3.69;282722;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Adult'];Jazz Bashara is a criminal. Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself—and that now, her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first.;"1 1/2 stars. I really wish I could say I liked this. A couple of years back, I gave in to the hype and read Weir's The Martian, and I have to say-- I loved it. The scary scenario of being stranded so far away from everything and everyone you know, the very high probability that Mark Watney wouldn't survive, his chirpy sense of humour that keeps him going... unfortunately,Artemis's plot is convoluted and less exciting. And Jazz Bashara is SO ANNOYING.Look, I completely get why Mark Watney annoyed some readers and, given that Weir transplanted his personality and awkward sense of humour into Jazz, it might seem a bit contradictory to have a problem with her personality. But, you know, Mark's narration worked for me because I could imagine this man in the middle of space needing to stay peppy and chatty. His inner narrative is conversational because he is talking to himself - and the reader - to avoid losing all hope. With Jazz, it doesn’t work so well.Even though Jazz is a woman in her twenties and Arab, she is basically Mark Watney. You can tell Weir really struggled to adapt his writing style in order to write from the perspective of that most alien of all species - THE WOMAN. Jazz has the sense of humour of a twelve-year-old boy. Her constant quips feel forced and unnecessary. Some of the comments she makes about her sex life and body are just... not funny. She's the local lunar tramp, which is, apparently, so hilarious. But her whole narrative is just plain awkward.
I turned my head inside the helmet, bit a nipple (try not to get excited), and sucked some water out.***“Billy, I’ve swallowed better-tasting stuff that came out of people.”
And what grown woman responds like this:
“What’s in there, anyway?”“Porn, mostly. Starring your mom.”
The real problem for me, though, was that I could not get invested in this half-assed heist plot. I was bored out of my mind with the random talk of gangsters, smuggling, some scientific sabotage blah blah and - oh my god - the welding. Mark Watney talked science to explain how he was going to survive and feed himself on Mars; Jazz talks science to explain the mechanics of welding. I couldn't understand why we were supposed to give a damn about this heist, or the whole conspiracy that develops out of it. Who cares whether Jazz earns herself some slugs (lunar currency)? Who cares if that guy who I didn't give a shit about dies?Weir takes some minor steps toward making the setting interesting, but then does nothing with it. This lunar colony is run by Kenyans, which is intriguing, but the culture is unmistakably American, and he never expands upon why or how Kenyans came to be controlling space travel. He throws out some fact about Kenya being near the equator, but never adequately explained it. The main story is also broken up with Jazz's letters to a Kenyan pen pal, starting when she is nine years old, but this never really goes anywhere and feels kind of pointless.Also, the author chooses to have a Muslim (non-practicing) narrator, which could lead to important representation, but it's hard not to cringe when he addresses his narrative to a solely white, non-Muslim audience: 
""Okay, you can stop pretending you know what a niqab is. It’s a traditional Islamic headwear that covers the lower face.""
 And then goes on to show Jazz using said niqab as a disguise while carrying out criminal activity. She pleasantly declares: 
""Great way to wear a mask without arousing suspicion.”
Yikes.It's just a very messy book overall, with a narrator that tries to be Mark Watney and fails, and a plot that tries to be compelling but isn't. Where the science added thrills and realism in The Martian, here it bogs the story down with boring detail. Weir should stick to survival stories with male narrators.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928122-artemis
Leviathan Wakes;James S.A. Corey;2011;2010;592;4.31;278968;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Mystery'];Humanity has colonized the solar system—Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt and beyond—but the stars are still out of our reach.Jim Holden is XO of an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the mining stations of the Belt.

But out in the Belt, the rules are different, and one small ship can change the fate of the universe.;"I complained in my review of Chasm City that the gee-whiz mechanics of space opera can't really sustain a 600-page narrative. It turns out I was perhaps incorrect: most of the lengthy examples I've sampled in the sub-genre (Alastair Reynolds, Iain M. Banks) are of the ""dark and gritty"" variety, grim, nihilistic visions of the future starring amoral asshole protagonists who are impossible to sympathize with. Even with a bunch of cool ideas on display, spending 700 pages in these books is exhausting. Inevitably, I like them for about 400 pages and then I just... get tired.But this book... this is the space opera I want to read. This book has the spirit of the genre's early days, characters who still marvel at the impossible immensity of the stars, but it isn't a pastiche or a throwback -- it's a natural evolution, and a remarkably satisfying one. The closest analogue I can think of is the oft-overpraised television show Firefly. Say what you will about the annoyingly zealous fanbase (or don't, you don't need the hate email); that show really did almost everything right in translating space opera to the modern age. The characters are complex, they operate in a world that is more grey than black & white, but each also has a clear moral center, so we know why they do the things they do, even when they are terrible things. You can make space opera (or epic fantasy or whatever) that is ""dark"" and ""gritty"" and still fun to read, with characters that are fun to read about. Because why would you want to explore the stars with assholes?I'm having some trouble locking the tractor beam on my point here, but it basically comes down to this: if you want me to invest in your lengthy space epic, you better give me something more to care about than magic space technology macguffin crap, because I will get sick of that. This book gave me cool ideas and everything else: archetypal characters that nevertheless manage to be compelling and sympathetic, interesting and very well thought out politics and economics, constant narrative momentum without sacrificing character... It's the most fun I've had reading sci-fi in a long time.I should have expected nothing less of Daniel Abraham, who is one-half of the pseudonymous James S.A. Corey; earlier this year, I gushed about the way he was able to do basically all the same stuff within the confines of the epic fantasy genre. And there is so much to like about the premise, just on the face of it: it's a few hundred years from now. Humanity has colonized Mars and invented an engine that allows fairly speedy travel, to a point. Our solar system has been colonized, with outposts on the moons of Saturn and spread across the asteroid belts, but we've gone no further because, come on, space is freaking huge and what are the chances we're going to invent warp drive and quickly stumble across the other needles in the galactic haystack? Besides, we've got enough to keep ourselves busy: colonizing space hasn't exactly united humanity, and Earth, Mars and the Outer Planets Alliance operate under an uneasy truce, with heavy prejudices on all sides.This stuff is very well thought out. People in the outer planets have lived for generations free from the constraints of heavy gravity, and have started to differ physically from Earthers. Language and culture have shifted too. This makes racism easier. Meanwhile the sheer logistical challenges of sustaining life on dead rocks (from mining interstellar ice to diets of food manufactured from algae) mean the ""Belters"" are still beholden to their terrestrial cousins.The plot is a potboiler, effectively combining space action with a noir murder mystery (the two storylines intertwined in chapters that alternate between two POV characters). The characters are, like I said, broad types in some ways, but you can do broad types very well; a stock character can still be well rounded and compelling. This book manages to star both a world-weary detective and an idealistic space captain (with a smart-mouthed love interest and some wise-cracking ship's crew in the background) and not feel like a retread, to give the characters tough moral choices (and sometimes they make the wrong ones), without turning them into unrepentant sociopaths. It goes back to what I was saying many, many paragraphs ago about honoring conventions while expanding upon them. I don't know if I am communicating this very well, but this book is all of that and also just impossible to stop reading. It's also funny without trying too hard, and thoughtful without being overly constructed or preachy. It's the book I have been looking for every time I picked up a space epic. I just didn't know until I found it.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8855321-leviathan-wakes

For their own safety, exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern.On a distant planet, a team of scientists is conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid--a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, Murderbot wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is, but when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.";"""Confession time: I don't actually know where we are.... I hadn't looked at the maps yet and I'd barely looked at the survey package. In my defense, we'd been here twenty-two planetary days and I hadn't had to do anything but stand around watching humans make scans or take samples of dirt, rocks, water, and leaves. The sense of urgency just wasn't there. Also, you may have noticed, I don't care.""I can relate to Murderbot, the misanthropic construct who is contracted to provide security detail for a small expedition to a planet. Murderbot, as the A.I. calls themselves (MB is sexless and has not chosen a pronoun), is plainly uncomfortable with personal attention and has little interest in anything outside entertainment videos and the bare minimum required to do their job. I have to confess that sounds like me during most of my adolescent years at every family event, ever, just substitute a book for video.""They’re academics, surveyors, researchers, not action-hero explorers from the serials I liked because they were unrealistic and not depressing and sordid like reality.""Written as a novella, the plot takes off from page two. It isn't long before both Murderbot and the team realize they're facing multiple types of danger. Characterization is one of the outstanding parts of the story, with Murderbot's nature getting a lot of subtle build. The team never stood out to any great degree, but that's partly because until this expedition, Murderbot has had generally negative experiences with the people they have been contracted to protect and assumed this group would be more of the same. The leader, Dr. Mensah, soon distinguishes herself with crisis management and leadership, (""It was starting to occur to me that Dr. Mensah might actually be an intrepid galactic explorer, even if she didn’t look like the ones on the entertainment feed"") while an augmented human, Gurathin, presents a different kind of challenge.“I do think of it as a person,” Gurathin said. “An angry, heavily armed person who has no reason to trust us.” “Then stop being mean to it,” Ratthi told him. “That might help.”My one hesitation in calling it a five star book is the ending, which felt somewhat awkward and incongruous to the personality of earlier 'Bot, who displayed little curiosity or independence. I read the story twice, the second time doing the math on the length of time 'Bot has been independent. I'm guessing around four years, based on their own estimate of 35k hours since they ""failed to become an uncontrolled killing machine."" The resolution felt like a shortcut, and like a logic failure in 'Bot's circuts. But I'm open to discussion on it.Final resolution aside, I certainly enjoyed the ride. I predict some kind of award nomination next season.Note from 2020: This is the first novella in a series of four, followed by a novel. Technically, they all are independent installments, a lot like the serials 'Bot is so fond of watching. However, once I was able to re-read the four novellas as a group--instead of upon release--I found the overall emotional arc/plot even more enjoyable than as installments.Note from 2024: it's like a delicious bedtime story.

It's why she's dedicated her life to creating a technology that will let us preserve our most precious memories. If she succeeds, anyone will be able to re-experience a first kiss, the birth of a child, the final moment with a dying parent.As Barry searches for the truth, he comes face to face with an opponent more terrifying than any disease—a force that attacks not just our minds, but the very fabric of the past. And as its effects begin to unmake the world as we know it, only he and Helena, working together, will stand a chance at defeating it.But how can they make a stand when reality itself is shifting and crumbling all around them?At once a relentless pageturner and an intricate science-fiction puzzlebox about time, identity, and memory, Recursion is a thriller as only Blake Crouch could imagine it—and his most ambitious, mind-boggling, irresistible work to date.;Congratulations for winning of best sci-fi category from goodreads choice awards 2020! This is one of my favorite books of the year! Five OMG I’m suffering from brain cells bleeding and explosion of my last standing grey cells, what the hell I just read and who am I ? stars!I know the drill but let me rephrase one more time! This is not an easy, soft, sunshine and rainbows reading! In my opinion people who are brave enough to dive into this journey should put themselves an IQ test and discover their cognitive skills. ( luckily I read the quantum physics for dummies before the beginning but I feel like I can be great cast for future dumb and dumber movie if they will ever produce the third installment)So this book is amazing combination of time traveling, alternated lifetimes, Minority Reports meet Groundhog Day versus Black Mirror and Back to the Future kinda fascinating science fiction crashes into thriller and romance starting with an effective and memorable suicide attempt scene. A woman suffers from FMS ( false memory syndrome) who thinks her child was being erased, her husband denied her existence so there was nothing better than jump and end her life. But she had small hope in her heart, her husband could come to rescue her but when he didn’t show up, she didn’t want to fight anymore and.... Yes, this book starts with jaw dropping scene and you’re hooked! It’s addictive, unputdownable, nerve damaging, exhausting ride! You wanna know what’s going to happen and think about yourself if I had a chance to save my loved ones by turning back and making my wrongs turn into rights, what would happen! Saving her daughter from the traffic accident, curing your mother’s Alzheimer disease, prevention of school shooting , saving soldiers from the terrorist attacks are just the samples writer show as in alternative realities that have possible to be changed! The difference of Recursion from Dark Matter might be romance parts because I really enjoyed Barry and Helena’s love story. Not only they fought to bring universe into the right pattern but also they fought to get back together to be each other’s final word, everlasting love, end game! This was thrilling, mind bending, provoking book! Dark Matters is going to be Netflix series and I’m already sure that as a brain numbing project, this book finds its place at big screen on near future!Highly recommended, smart, different, unique and exquisite book but not for everyone!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42046112-recursion
Crossed;Ally Condie;2011;2010;367;3.52;249720;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Teen'];The Society chooses everything. The books you read. The music you listen to. The person you love. Yet for Cassia the rules have changed. Ky has been taken and she will sacrifice everything to find him. And when Cassia discovers Ky has escaped to the wild frontiers beyond the Society there is hope.But on the edge of society nothing is as it seems...A rebellion is rising.And a tangled web of lies and double-crosses could destroy everything.;"Psst...Stephanie. Wake up, it's over. Oh, man. Did I fall asleep again? It's not my fault. Really, it isn't. If only Crossed had just a little bit more action and a lot less poetry, it would have been able to keep my attention focused on reading the book instead of hitting my REM cycle. That's not to say I didn't entirely enjoy Crossed, but it also didn't live up to my expectations. Crossed picks up where Matched left off. Ky had been sent away to the Outer Provinces and Cassia is currently residing in a girl's work camp. In this installment she travels to the Outer Provinces to find Ky, while he somehow escapes the Outer Provinces to be reunited with Cassia back in the Society. A few new discoveries are made regarding the Society and an apparent rebellion called the Rising. Along the way, enough poetry to give Maya Angelou a headache is recited and flashbacks to Ky's past are also included. I had high hopes for this book mostly because I did enjoy Matched. I enjoyed the ""Do not go gently"" theme and Condie's poetic writing style. But for some reason it just didn't work out too well for me in Crossed. I liked how the PoVs switched back and forth between Ky and Cassia. In fact, I am a fan of that particular style, when done correctly. However, in this case I found it difficult to tell who was who. Cassia and Ky's voice sounded exactly alike to me. I found myself flipping back to the beginning of the chapters to confirm who was narrating. Because of this I slowly felt myself becoming disconnected from the characters even with learning further details about Ky's past. The Characters:One thing I did enjoy about the book were the introduction of the minor characters. While traveling to the Outer Provinces to find Ky, Cassia teams up with a girl named Indie. At first I really liked Indie because she was brave, sharp, and determined. But around 77% of the book she seemed too sneaky to me and I didn't appreciate her lying to Cassia about the Rising. At one point she even asks Ky to travel with her to the Rising and leave Cassia! She also steals from Cassia and Cassia has the nerve to ask, ""What else has she been hiding? Does she even think we are friends?"" Umm...Cassia? Someone who steals and lies is not a friend. I do think she created an interesting dynamic to the story, but I'm not entirely sure I liked her as a character. Ky also travels with two other companions: a boy named Eli who reminds him of Bram (Cassia's younger brother) and Vick. I actually liked both of those new characters very much. In fact, they were my saving grace for this book. To me they seemed to be the only two characters that actually expressed realistic reactions to things. Eli asks questions that should be asked and Vick gets angry when everyone else is maintaining unrealistic calmed facade. I didn't like how Condie killed off Vick. His death was the reason why Ky and Eli decided to stay put long enough for Cassia to catch up to Ky. I felt she did that to attempt a realistic reunion for Cassia and Ky. I didn't buy that for one minute because it seemed very deliberate on Condie's part and forced. Cassia and Ky irritated me to no end, especially Ky. He knew about the Rising since Matched and never told Cassia. I was willing to accept that until he continued to try and hide his knowledge after their reunion. He was extremely selfish in this book. Not only that, but his explanation as to why he didn't want to join the Rising didn't make much sense to me and it ultimately almost breaks them up. After they have traveled all that time endangering their lives, they almost throw it completely away. Unbelievable. Cassia is no better because she waits until the last possible moment to confront Indie and Ky. Great. Just great. Another complacent heroine.Condie does manage to keep Xander in the picture despite his small page time. Both Cassia and Ky think of him often and have flashbacks involving him. And it also appears that a love-square may be forming. Yes, feel free to >insert eye rolling here<.The Prose:There are a few quotes that I really loved in Crossed. Like this one: 
Everyone has something of beauty about them. In the beginning for me, it was Ky’s eyes I noticed, and I love them still. But loving lets you look, and look, and look again. You notice the back of a hand, the turn of a head, the way of a walk. When you first love, you look blind and you see it all as the glorious, beloved whole, or a beautiful sum of beautiful parts. But when you see the one you love as pieces, as whys—why he walks like this, why he closes his eyes like that—you can love those parts, too, and it’s a love at once more complicated and more complete.
 I think Condie is gifted with writing some truly beautiful passages. However, when the entire book is filled with your characters sitting on rocks reciting poetry every few pages, my patience tends to fly out the window. One minute I'm reading Crossed and the next minute I'm:A) Falling asleepOr B) Getting distracted by squirrelsI'm not even sure where the climax was because I was just that bored with the plot, characters, everything. It was like watching the Peanut gang's parents go, ""Blah, blah, blah, blah."" LOL. Maybe I fell asleep at that part. It really wouldn't surprise me if that were the case. The World Building:I was hoping to see more world building in this installment, but I was once again left with many unanswered questions. Who runs the Society? How are these rebels slipping in and out of the Society if the Society has such a strict eye on things? Who put Ky's name into the Matching pool? Where are all the Provinces located? Several are mentioned in the book, but I have no idea where they are located. I feel this series could really use a world map. Speaking of the world, is the Society located over the entire world? The way it is described seems like it's only in one part of the world. What in the world is the Warming? It's mentioned in Crossed, but it's not really explained well.

Morning Star;Pierce Brown;2016;2010;525;4.52;247186;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook', 'Young Adult', 'Adult'];Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society’s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within. Finally, the time has come. But devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied—and too glorious to surrender.;"When I'm starting a big multi-volume story, one of the big concerns isn't just if the individual books are good. And it's not just whether or not the books work well as a series. (Because a series is different than a multi-volume story.)No. The big issue with a multi-volume story is how the *whole* thing wraps up. And as anyone who ever watched the Matrix movies knows, the final part of a trilogy can, in effect, go back in time and ruin the previous otherwise enjoyable story. I'm happy to say that this multi-volume work rounds out very nicely. (Honestly, I probably wouldn't have talked about it here at all if it ended as a train wreck.) Meaning that you can read the series confident that you aren't going to get screwed by some ""it was all just a dream"" bullshit, or something to that effect showing up in the last book.Not only is the series well-written. But it has a lot more complexity than I'd originally expected. Both in the characters, the plot, and in its morality. And personally, I'm a big fan of complexity.The other thing that really stands out is the fact that the books are unpredictable without being irritating or disappointing. I'm pretty good at anticipating where a story is going to go, and these books constantly zigged when I expected them to zag. But (and this is a really important note) while the ziggs the book took were surprising, they were always sensible and fit smoothly into the overall narrative and world.So yeah. Good books. Good trilogy. Unpredictable. Clever. Well-written. Very much worth your time.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18966806-morning-star
Annihilation;Jeff VanderMeer;2014;2010;195;3.77;244514;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery', 'Audiobook', 'Dystopia'];"Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In Annihilation, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy, we join the twelfth expedition.The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.";"I am sure that it will shock to many readers my low rating of this popular novel, but sadly I think that it's the best way to express my own personal reading experience with the book. And I prefer to be honest than just giving a high rating if I don't believe on it.First of all, I don't hate the author and I am not looking for affecting the average rating of this novel.Basically, I had to balance the meaning of each rating here on Goodreads against what I thought about my reading experience with the novel, and I realized that I wasn't confortable even thinking on the book that ""I like it"" which it would imply a 3-stars rating, so at the end, I opted to give it a 2-star rating, but I don't enjoy to do it.Maybe I am not the ideal reader for this kind of stories. Maybe, while I am huge fan of science fiction, I am not ready to read ""weird fiction"" that it's the closest way to genre the novel. It wasn't the surreal elements since I am used to read and watch surreal material like Alan Moore's comic books or Luis Buñuel's films.I think that my frustration with this particular novel was the inconclusive ending along with the knowledge that maybe some of the information on the story can be false and most of all, the lack of any single explanation of what the heck is going on.I understand that it's a trilogy, I get that it's a mystery, so the author can't explain all on the very first book, but I think that any novel has to bring some kind of closure on itself. Also, some explanations could be appreaciated. You don't have to explain everything but at least something....when you see beauty in desolation, it changes something in you.That's a quote from the book, and analyzing my general impression of the book, sadly I think that the novel was like a ""desolation"" to me. No explanations, unreliable facts and an abrupt ending. So, I suppose that I am still the same, since I didn't change and I still don't find ""beauty"" on ""desolation"".What I can appraise is the great writing style along with the smart and mature tone of the story.Please, if you are curious about the novel, read it, just like I did it. I really do hope that you can enjoy to the fullest this novel. No two people read the same book. So, while I couldn't find it as a possitive reading experience, maybe for you will be different and that it can be just awesome.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934530-annihilation
Tender Is the Flesh;Agustina Bazterrica;2017;2010;209;3.79;242280;no;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Adult'];A causa de un virus mortal que afecta a los animales y contagia a los seres humanos, el mundo se ha convertido en un lugar gris, escéptico e inhóspito, y la sociedad se divide entre aquellos que comen y aquellos que son comidos.El Premio Clarín 2017 fue otorgado a esta novela mayor, una sólida y escalofriante pesadilla futurista en la que el canibalismo es legitimado en gran parte del mundo a causa de un virus que afecta a los animales y resulta mortal para los seres humanos. ¿Qué resto de humanismo puede caber cuando los cuerpos de los muertos son cremados para evitar su consumo? ¿En qué lugar queda el vínculo con el otro si, de verdad, somos lo que comemos? En esta despiadada distopía -tan brutal como sutil, tan alegórica como realista-, Agustina Bazterrica inspira, con el poder explosivo de la ficción, sensaciones y debates de suma actualidad.;"Many might say that a book dealing with the level of brutality and horrific subject matter that makes up this book could never be thoughtful or highbrow. I disagree with that. I definitely think literature depicting graphic violence doesn't automatically disqualify it from being anything more than an assault on the senses or torture porn. I think it can lay out valuable examinations of so many aspects of society that deserve to be scrutinized, all while remaining allegorical. Battle Royale by Koushun Takami (as well as its film adaptation) is just one example of a successful novel of this nature.Unfortunately, Tender Is The Flesh didn't live up to that expectation for me.It truly is brimming with brutality. In fact, that's all it is, is brutal. A virus that turns animal meat poisonous to humans causes humans to slaughter every non-human animal and begin factory farming human beings for food instead. You would think that a concept such as: ""imagine what the world would be like if humans were treated the way we treat animals in factory farms"" would have a lot to say. Just think about the fact that in the western part of the world, most people don't think twice about eating certain animals as food, but will get disgusted, enraged and even downright racist when other cultures in other parts of the world eat animals westerners don't view as 'food animals'. Or the fact that most people eat fish, have no qualms with the concept of fishing, but will protest whale hunting as it applies to various Indigenous cultures, particularly Inuit. I could go on and on. The point is, a book with this concept could tackle some serious societal issues - environmental destruction, racism, health, food insecurity, speciesism, etc. As I entered this book and continued reading through it, I often wondered, ""are we going to examine which humans are deemed 'food humans' in a meaningful way? Does it even matter? Does race, class, sexuality, or anything come into play in this near-future dystopian world that so closely could resemble our own?""And the answer is no. Because this book unpacks nothing.There were certainly minor suggestions toward some things, but they were quickly set aside in order to either continue describing the horrific acts inflicted upon these farmed humans, or to meander on about mundane things in the main character's personal life that ended up having little to no significance on the overall story. We didn't even really get anything in the way of showing how people came to accept this cannibalistic way of life, or how those who work in these factories are affected in their personal lives. The closest we get to a glimpse of this is the main character essentially being described as not caring one way or another, human or non-human slaughter, because he was only in the industry in order to pay for his father's nursing home. I'm sorry, but that is just not well-rounded enough for me as a reader. There was even the compelling hint at an ongoing conspiracy theory that the virus was faked by governments in order to deceive society into cannibalism as a means to alleviate overpopulation. However, this subplot peters out pretty quickly, but only after having a group of teenage boys briefly bring up the conspiracy's existence in conversation while graphically killing a litter of puppies they found in an abandoned zoo. Again, it's brutality for the sake of brutality and seemingly nothing else.Of course, I don't need -and I know many other readers don't need- literature or any form of entertainment to have a big, glaring moral spoonfed to me/us. Despite all that I've said, I hope it doesn't seem like I'm implying I didn't like this book because it didn't hold my hand while leading me through a clear and precise commentary of my own biases. I don't need that. But if a book is to be this grotesque in its depictions, I do think it should either go completely nihilistic (and thus let that speak for itself) or have at least something compelling to show for it. I think, overall, this book felt incomplete to me and that's my biggest gripe. The author certainly had ideas, but because her world-building was weak and her writing offered little in the way of depth, those ideas never really broke the surface and ended up fizzling out before anything of interest or import could come of it.Underneath all its gruesomeness, shock value and gore, it's actually a super boring book.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49090884-tender-is-the-flesh

This Is How You Lose the Time War;Amal El-Mohtar;2019;2010;209;3.88;240169;no;['Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Time Travel'];Among the ashes of a dying world, an agent of the Commandant finds a letter. It reads: Burn before reading. Thus begins an unlikely correspondence between two rival agents hellbent on securing the best possible future for their warring factions. Now, what began as a taunt, a battlefield boast, grows into something more. Something epic. Something romantic. Something that could change the past and the future.Except the discovery of their bond would mean death for each of them. There's still a war going on, after all. And someone has to win that war.;"‘I want to be a context for you, and you for me.’There is something uniquely affecting when love is painted against the backdrop of the limitlessness of space and time. The effect has been done many times over but nothing can prepare you for the extraordinary beauty in which This is How You Lose the Time War allows you to experience love stretching out and weaving across time and dimensions to examine just how infinite it can possibly be. A spark of emotion that shines through galaxies reduced to dust, the countless rises and falls of mortal empires, the lifespans of all human feats and follies. Co-written by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, each writing one of the two protagonists, the novel is a soaring epistalatory sapphic romance between two rival time-traveling agents in a war between their respective societies to control and rewrite the multiverse in order to eradicate the other. Spawn by a private battlefield provocation, the two agents become caught in a maelstrom of self-discovery and romance corresponding by letters as they chase each other across time and space in a playful and imaginative novel so searingly beautiful the cosmos can barely contain it.These two authors have created something charmingly original in Time War, enhanced by the distinct dueling voices of the authors as their prose communicates and responds to each other along with their characters. Many of these letters, particularly in the novel’s latter half, blossom into pure ethereal poetry. On occasion it dips into purple prose, as one letter admits, however, what a clever sentiment for a profession of love between characters named Red and Blue to evolve into purple. The writing remains crisp, rotating between short narration and the correspondence between the two, allowing the narrative to progress as strongly on wings of emotion as it does the chain of events. What transpires is often intentionally vague as no time is wasted on much exposition or explanation, but fully immerses you in a world you won’t quite grasp or understand. It’s as if this gorgeous landscape of the multiverse were simply a blur as you are focused on the interaction between Red and Blue, much the way the world around you fades from focus in the first moments of love.Ultimately, any attempt at concreteness in a universe in a constant state of flux and revision would be beside the point, and the vagueness reflects that. It is only though the shared connection between Red and Blue that we can find a stable focal point as they pass through a kaleidoscope of time. Much like the way the pair gives context to one another, our only context is through them as well. They are each other’s only tether to stability in an unstable reality.‘When did it happen? Or has it always happened? Like your victory, love spreads back through time.’Entire multi-dimensions are shifted, burned or woven together on the battlefield of time between Garden, an organic and collectivist society from which Blue has grown, and Agency, a post-singularity mechanical society that created Red. They are locked in an eternal time-war of which the specifics and origins of are rarely addressed and even then are quite vague. The novel makes reference to Romeo and Juliet in narrative and thematically (the play, it is said, has different endings in each strand of time), and shares it’s notion of a long-standing feud where all existing players have forgotten why but continue to play it out to the point of extreme violence. What they are doing exactly is a bit elusive but strands are altered by, say, helping a city build a port or ensuring a mathematical formula survives the destruction of Atlantis: little things that add up over centuries to create wholly different versions of reality that are fought over.‘In the war they wage through time, what lasting advantage comes from murdering ghosts, who, with a slight shift of threads, will return to life or live different lives that never bright them to the executioner’s blade?...No death sticks but the one that matters.’ ‘What a microcosm we are of the war as a whole, you and I,’ Blue writes to Red early on, ‘An action and an equal and opposite reaction.’ The two women--they identify as she/her and can take on human form though you’d be hard pressed to form a definite image of what they look like based on the various hints--who’s designation as Red and Blue help to impress an idea as mere players in a game, are equals of one another, rivals ever, which is the initial attraction between the them. ‘They were separate, they did not speak, but each shaped the other, even as they were shaped in turn.’ What begins as a game of hunter and hunted in boasting and taunting letters quickly gives way to deep conversations about the self that makes them aware they have an agency beyond their respective Agencies and despite being weapons of war have a taste for the finer and beautiful things in life. In those moments they realize there is a hole inside them that only the other can fill. And as their love grows, they begin to wonder--partly due to the millenia of time they criss-cross during their budding attraction--if perhaps the love didn’t just arrive but had always been there. As with any sci-fi involving time travel, there is the inevitable paradox of events and free-will within a shifting reality and the two authors harness this paradox into their novel towards an exquisite and emotional end.‘There’s a kind of time travel in letters, isn’t there?’‘Letters are structures, not events,’ Red writes to Blue, ‘Yours give me a place to live inside.’ This beautiful refuge from war they’ve found in their secret correspondence also becomes a commentary on language and communication itself. In whimsical sci-fi nature, they write in abstract languages found in reading the structure of leaves on a plant or decoding rings on a tree (just let it happen, it’s super cool), which reflects the way the tools of writing shape how we write--a topic often written upon by philosopher Jacques Derrida. Their secret letters envelope the secrecy of their relationship and dangers they face even reading letters from the enemy, which is fascinating to think of considering a digital age where communication can occur through images (entire conversations can be had with emojis and memes) or other non-alphabetic communication. In our modern world we continue to embrace non-verbal communication that relationships can be built from, such as how with online dating many people exist only in messages to one another before meeting and form an attraction that way. It is a beautiful notion to consider how through just our words we can fall in love with the essence of another by showing an understanding, empathy and passion for the thoughts of each other (when I first met my partner we met in person only three times before she moved back to Ireland so for months we got to know each other through long late night texting and her sending me letters, so love across distance has always spoken to me pretty well). Messages written at one place in time, sent, and received in another transmitting emotions across time and space. ‘Books are letters in bottles,’ one letter reads, ‘cast into the waves of time, from one person trying to save the world to another.’ All books are love letters, if you think about it. One person sending out a message in hopes someone will understand and understand them in turn, an abstract connection that reaches even beyond the grave. There is a voyeuristic sense to this novel--reading their letters and all--but it reminds us of our primal instincts that desire connection and the fireworks of emotion that come from first contact with it. It is nearly impossible to not be swept up in their romance and feel their fears, pains, and needs standing naked and unafraid before one another, like a tree in winter unashamed of it’s gnarled limbs. ‘Love is what we have, against time and death, against all the powers ranged to crush us down.’There is a subtle shadow of dread cast across their saga keeping the reader keenly aware that their taboo relationship is always threatened by the larger world in which they exist. Agency traces Blue’s exploits and wishes to set a trap for her, one Red will be used to ensure the success of the mission. Betrayal exists in the peripheries of this novel at all times, especially when they begin to open up hoping this isn’t just some long con. Poison is an important theme throughout the novel, with the women taunting each other that any letter could be laced with it and choosing to read forward anyways. It reminds us of how we remove our armor and open ourselves up to pain when we choose to love. War begets death and suffering, and the two players have entered into this affair knowing the risks but plunging on ahead regardless. ‘I want to meet you in every place I have loved.’It is difficult to say much more without spoiling anything in this clever plotted novel. It is one that encourages an immediate reread, as clues and puzzle pieces are weaved into the novel much like the way our heroines weave space and time together for their purposes. It is an extraordinary little book that somehow manages to never feel like a gimmick despite it’s inventive and quirky nature. Time, place, love, and war all become a potent concoction for one of the most tender and vulnerable romances I’ve ever read. I could praise it all day long but, as is written in one of the cosmic letters, ‘I am the songbird running out of air, and I must breathe.’4.5/5‘I want to be a body for you. I want to chase you, find you, I want to be eluded and teased and adored; I want to be defeated and victorious—I want you to cut me, sharpen me. I want to drink tea beside you in ten years or a thousand. Flowers grow far away on a planet they’ll call Cephalus, and these flowers bloom once a century, when the living star and its black-hole binary enter conjunction.I want to fix you a bouquet of them, gathered across eight hundred thousand years, so you can draw our whole engagement in a single breath, all the ages we’ve shaped together.’";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43352954-this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war
The Power;Naomi Alderman;2016;2010;341;3.76;236516;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Feminism', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Speculative Fiction'];"In The Power the world is a recognizable place: There's a rich Nigerian boy who lounges around the family pool; a foster kid whose religious parents hide their true nature; an ambitious American politician; and a tough London girl from a tricky family. But then a vital new force takes root and flourishes, causing their lives to converge with devastating effect. Teenage girls now have immense physical power: They can cause agonizing pain and even death. With this small twist of nature, the world drastically resets.";"It doesn’t matter that she shouldn’t, that she never would. What matters is that she could, if she wanted.
TW: rape.Ooh, this is a toughie. I have a lot of mixed feelings about Alderman's The Power. It's an intriguing and clever concept, but this never really translates into an engaging story.Imagine if one day, suddenly, girls developed a strange physical power: they can produce electricity inside them. They can use this power to hurt, to torture, and to kill. A world that is built on patriarchy is suddenly upturned - being a woman is synonymous with power and strength, men are the ones afraid to walk alone at night, the female body itself becomes an instrument of power.With obvious nods to rape culture, The Power imagines what the world would be like if men, not women, had to live in constant fear for their physical safety. Alderman considers how this would affect a variety of people and issues, from terrorism to religion, and she does this through the eyes of four very different people.There's Roxy, a white British teenager and the daughter of a gangster. There's Allie, a mixed-race girl who runs away after years of abuse and finds herself at a convent, revered as some kind of goddess. There's Margot, an American mayor and one of the few older women to develop the power. And then Tunde, a young Nigerian man and aspiring journalist who captures early footage of the power in action.The four perspectives are unequal and uneven, with certain perspectives being much more interesting for part of the book and then becoming tedious, and others doing the reverse of that. Some of the characters verge on cliches and stereotypes too. Additionally, the whole novel uses a research/book proposal as a framing device - a guy called Neil writes to Alderman with the draft of his work attached - which is interesting, but the book does actually feel like a piece of research at times.I felt like most of the book explored a concept without telling a story. After the initial discovery of the powers and the subsequent affect on the world, the book kind of stalled, and lots of chapters felt dragged out without purpose or direction. Allie's perspective became deeply entrenched in religion, more so than was interesting, and I quickly lost interest in where the other POVs were going.Also, some parts seemed a little too simplistic. I honestly don't believe that Saudi women would embrace rebellion so readily and to that extent. The notion that Muslim women are just waiting to throw off their clothes, riot in the street, and have casual sex seems like a blinkered ""Western"" perspective. Sure, maybe this would evolve over time if Saudi women had power, but I find it very hard to believe that anyone would cast off centuries of cultural practices in a matter of days.The Power is a real mixed bag full of fascinating ideas, lack of focus, over-simplified male/female power dynamics, and some clever subversive scenes. I particularly liked the part where one woman claims that some boys ""secretly like it"", a play on the notion of ""asking for it"" in rape culture.A hard book to rate. I wonder if it would have made a better short story.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power

Dr. Caldwell calls her ""our little genius.""Every morning, Melanie waits in her cell to be collected for class. When they come for her, Sergeant Parks keeps his gun pointing at her while two of his people strap her into the wheelchair. She thinks they don't like her. She jokes that she won't bite, but they don't laugh.Melanie loves school. She loves learning about spelling and sums and the world outside the classroom and the children's cells. She tells her favorite teacher all the things she'll do when she grows up. Melanie doesn't know why this makes Miss Justineau look sad.The Girl with All the Gifts is a sensational thriller, perfect for fans of Stephen King, Justin Cronin, and Neil Gaiman.";"“And then like Pandora, opening the great big box of the world and not being afraid, not even caring whether what’s inside is good or bad. Because it’s both. Everything is always both. But you have to open it to find that out.”
I have to say that I'm not much of a traditional zombie fan - moaning, slow-walking dead people are neither interesting nor scary to me - but there is nothing traditional about this book.Firstly, this is not an old school ""how to get away from the zombies and stay alive"" kind of book. It opens from the perspective of these zombies - intelligent, emotional, child zombies - and Melanie is one of them. A young, intelligent girl who is seemingly full of life, curiosity and the ability to form emotional attachments.The way the story is told from a specific perspective is important, changing the way we view Melanie and the other ""children"". They are first presented as thoughtful, frightened kids in a situation that makes us instantly sympathetic. We are not allowed to simply view them as necessary sacrifices in the hunt for a zombie cure.It is more of an introspective, philosophical book about what it means to be human and how being human might not necessarily make you one of the good guys, than it is an action-packed adventure full of chases and shoot-outs (though there is some of that too).At the heart of this story is Melanie's relationship with her beloved teacher Miss Justineau. And, through the teacher's stories and inspiration (with particular reference to the story of Pandora), it is also about Melanie's quest for love and acceptance, as well as an understanding of who she is.The zombie science felt new and interesting, despite my aversion to most technical language, and all the principal characters are well-developed with their own history, motivations and aspirations. The author even takes time to develop a deeper understanding of those characters we will never come to like.If you are looking for horror and traditional zombies, The Girl with All the Gifts might not be the book for you. But if you'd like something refreshing, moving and more character-driven, I would highly recommend it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17235026-the-girl-with-all-the-gifts
Wool Omnibus;Hugh Howey;2012;2010;509;4.22;222817;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];This Omnibus Edition collects the five Wool books into a single volume. The first Wool story was released as a standalone short in July of 2011. Due to reviewer demand, the rest of the story was released over the next six months. This is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.Alternate cover for B0071XO8RA;"There are two stupid things about this book, neither have to do with the writing. The writing is good, the story is original, I highly recommend this book. Let's address the stupid things. The name is stupid. It is like a garage band was after a clever name. There are no sheep in this book, there is no wool in this book. There is one tiny insignificant piece where a character is knitting but she isn't even using wool, she knits with cotton. Given the subtitles are all knitting related (unravel, cast off etc) I think the book should have been called ""knitting"" and then the book would have never sold a single copy. I shall rename the book for the author SILO. Hereafter I shall refer to the book as such... Because it is a much better name that will actually appeal to the target market. The second stupid thing about SILO (okay WOOL but my name is better) is that it is serialised into individual books. The author asks at the end of this omnibus if the reader would rate and review each book separately. As far as books/stories/novellas go only WOOL1 and WOOL 3 really stand alone. The others are just parts in a novel. They are also all the size of novellas not novels, making this omnibus edition about the size of a book. Here is my advice to the author. Just sell the omnibus edition, ebook users can read a sample anyway, the $6 price tag is very reasonable for the whole book. In fact because I didn't realise it was a series of novellas I bought the first part plus the omnibus which was silly of me. Perhaps good for the authors pocket but it doesn't endear me toward him. None of that has anything to do with the novel. The novel was original and highly interesting. Finally a novel that I don't think I could flippantly surmise in a paragraph or two. Usually I do like to give a summary of the novel but I won't in this review as I think there are lots of refreshing little things about the novel that are enjoyable to discover while reading, plus a few good places where you can say ""oh wow I didn't see that coming"". WOOL is a good little dystopian novel. The type that leaves you thinking about it for days. The type that creeps back into your mind months after you have read it. It has a fairly original concept that kept me thinking. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to all lovers of dystopian fiction. Despite complaining about the way it has been serialised I am hoping the author has lots more little stories about this world coming. ETA: Before you comment.  This review has been around for almost two years, and it has spawned a wonderful bunch of friendly people who laugh and joke in the comment section - many (most?) of whom completely disagree with me. Please read the comments (even the first page or two). You don't want to be that douche who thinks he is the first person in 500 comments to think to inform me that wool was used for cleaning, or that is was a metaphor. I disagree with the importance of either as a reason for naming the book WOOL, and if you read even a few of my comments you will find lots of reasoning. Enjoy the community, but don't be the dude that makes us snogger (yes, so crazy is this littler community that we even coined our own word!!).ETA: Ten years later *cough* Apple TV went with the name Silo *cough* I was right *cough*!! But seriously - WOOT Hugh Howey for a well deserved book getting turned into a series. (Also Kudos to the two woman who read ten years worth of comments before posting, wow!!)";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13453029-wool-omnibus
Champion;Marie Lu;2013;2010;483;4.32;222186;yes;['Dystopia', 'Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook'];A New York Times Bestseller The explosive finale to Marie Lu’s bestselling Legend trilogy … He is a Legend. She is a Prodigy. Who will be Champion? June and Day have sacrificed so much for the people of the Republic‚ and now their country is on the brink of a new existence. But neither could have predicted the circumstances that will reunite them. Just when a peace treaty is imminent‚ a plague outbreak causes panic in the Colonies‚ and war threatens the Republic’s border cities. Only June knows the key to her country’s defense.;"If Prodigy made me want to cry and scream and pretty much throw a tantrum like a little girl, Champion made all my troubles go away. I am very well satisfied with the ending of this series, and although I still have lots of questions for what will happen in June's future I can fill those gaps with my own imagination. Marie Lu did a wonderful job with this entire series, and ended it in a bittersweet note. Without giving out too many spoilers, or none at all, Champion will make your eyes water but it will also lift your spirits.I am so happy the way that things ended up, yet sad at the same time. Considering all the other endings to the rest of the series ending this year (Allegiant, Morganville Vampires, etc.) I think Marie Lu managed to create her own ending that doesn't compare to the rest. The book's pace was good, the problems it wanted to resolve were plenty and engrossing, and the characters stayed true to form. I can't exactly go deeper into this review without giving anything away, so just know that Champion was worth the wait and it did not disappoint in the slightest. It was the best ending for this tragic world and marvelous series, and I cannot wait to read more books by Marie Lu in the future. The rest of the review is full of spoilers, so read at your own discretion...Day lives. *deep breathe* finally got that off my chest! I AM SO HAPPY! I would have been DEVASTATED if he too had died. No June doesn't die, or Eden, or anyone important for that matter. We get a sort of happy ending that isn't perfect but it's still something. Some people wanted Day to die, don't know why, but I didn't want him to die.There was this scene in the novel that made me realize how much I hate dead mother's who come back once their kid's at death's door [Allegiant, anyone?]. However instead of the mother being all ""it's time to go sweetie, well done dying and all!"" she was all like ""go back to Eden, he needs you."" and I swear I had never loved that woman more. I thought this was going to be the same scene we got in Allegiant and I was already getting pissed off, but then it surprised me. Well done!Another good thing about Champion, Tess is back, and she isn't the annoying little girl she was in Prodigy! Even the characters comment on this, how she has grown up and let go of her grudges. Her and Day make up, and also she becomes friend's with June. Hurray! I was so not up to reading about her tantrums (mine were enough last book thank you). Now she is a level headed girl who you don't want to kill. And for this I give her one full paragraph in my review.Anden and June. In a world were Day wasn't in the picture these two would be perfect for each other. In fact, I was kind of shipping for them anyways. It was up to June really, but her and Anden together would have taken the world by storm. They did date for a while (the book goes 10 years into the future) but ultimately they break up cause June can't love him how he deserves to be loved. Anden is so sweet, I am just glad that June will protect him as a Commander and be close by so he doesn't give in into his evil urges (passing, but it happens).Day and his tumor. All he needed apperantely was some very shiny technology to make everything better! This part of the story really makes you think though. In our own country, where technology is in reality superior to other countries, we don't go out of our way to help those people who are at death's door. We are Antartica, and we are the Republic in some ways as well. Should we go out of our way? Too many people in the world need help, specially people who are already inside our borders. Does this make us bad guys? That we are concerned with our citizen's first and then the rest of the world? That we let the rest of the world fight their own battles (most of the time) so that our men won't die? I don't know. Politics are rough, but at least Champion, and the series in general, makes you think about these problems, and realize that it isn't easy running a country without making some mistakes.The bittersweet end: Day loses all memories of June, yet he survives. Day gets shot, twice, and June asks a higher power (Marie Lu?) to save him, and that she will give up anything in order for this to happen. Thus Day loses his memories of her. I don't exactly know what this means in terms of there actually being a higher power in the novel that answers prayers, or if we should just take it as a coincidence, but whatever. I am not a religious person, but I still enjoyed that part. Now, what I don't get is how could day really not know who June is, I guess he doesn't remember anything that happen since Legend. All those memories gone, which kind of means the Day that we love is sort of gone. He is there, yet he isn't. Memories make up who we are, so when he woke up in that bed and couldn't remember anything that happen in the last year I felt like a little part of myself died. I felt as dejected as June, but she does the ""right"" thing and leaves him to heal (she doesn't want to remind him every day the pain of her involvement in his family's death. 10 years later they meet again and Day says he felt like he found something he was missing when he saw her again.Even in his memory-less self he can still make a girl swoon. He may get all his memories back of June now that he has found her again, but that is left up to us and our imagination I guess. I call for a NOVELLA. Who's with me? In the end Champion was everything I hoped it would be. Really, it was. It was special. It makes my heart flutter, and I will remember/reread it for years to come. It was well worth the wait.PS; If you guys liked the Legend Series you will definitely LOVE Marie Lu's next book The Young Elites. I've read it and it was So good!!Previous Update after finishing Prodigy:After finishing Prodigy I want to cry and scream. I want to buy chocolate ice cream, invite my girlfriends over, and vent over how good Prodigy was and the injustice of waiting more than a year for the next book. I knew I shouldn't have read Prodigy ahead of schedule, now the waiting is going to be even longer, and harder. All I know is that Legend #3 CHAMPION (Fancy!) is BOUND to kick some major ass. I wonder if we are going to go some years into the future, that would be cool. Or if we are just going to pick up weeks, or months after. I hope for the former. I wonder what is going to happen to the Republic, to Anden, to Day, and to June. But most of all I really hope Tess never comes back into the picture. Her mood swings annoyed me lol";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18291576-champion
The Circle;Dave Eggers;2013;2010;493;3.43;221070;yes;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Novels'];alternate cover for ISBN 9780385351393When Mae Holland is hired to work for the Circle, the world’s most powerful internet company, she feels she’s been given the opportunity of a lifetime. The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users’ personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency.As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company’s modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO.Mae can’t believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in the world—even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public.What begins as the captivating story of one woman’s ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge.;"UPDATE: My review of this book's sequel, The Every, is out now.--------A 491 page soap box. Here's what's wrong with it, in no particular order:(1) Not offering anything new to the conversation. I imagine I will not be the only fan of dystopian literature who will be bored and feel this is retreading old territory already covered in books written long before the age of the internet. As a human being living in a first world country, the comparisons one can draw between real-life companies and the Circle are second nature: Facebook's ever-changing privacy policies, the tender feelings of Facebook culture, Google's enormity (delving into other spheres like banking, phones, etc.) and well-publicized work environment, Steve Jobs' cool public image, WikiLeaks' total transparency, country-wide privatization of what were previously public services, etc. Likewise, it is easy to see pieces of other stories in this one, whether dystopian (1984's watchful eye eliminating privacy and its bold-faced mantras), comedic (Office Space's passive aggressive pressure for more ""pieces of flare,"" though this is treated humorlessly in The Circle) and best-forgotten flops (Idiocracy's ruling class communicating through a hyper-dumbed-down language/culture of cool, something I'm thankful is sloppily forgotten less than halfway into The Circle). That amounts to a lot of boxes checked off by the book, but it doesn't take any bold steps of its own. At its simplest, it is a cautionary tale about a would-be utopia that gradually loses its shine, a hammer Animal Farm mercifully only pounded me with for 100 pages or so.(2) The tone. The only thing complicated about the book's tone is this: when it chooses to voice the possible consequences of a powerhouse entity like the Circle, does it realize these concerns are pretty much universally recognized already? I can't determine whether the book means to be trite or condescending. Which brings me to...(3) The audience. While I don't believe an author should dumb down books for a younger generation, the themes of this book might make more of an impact on a younger audience, though it clearly wasn't written for them. Why write a book that warns against sacrificing privacy online and volunteering one's soul to large corporate entities (no matter how genial), if only to market it to a generation who spends its time warning its own children about the same issues? (Side note: In the year since I wrote this review I've noticed that, like Ayn Rand books, this book's fans appear to simply agree with the message of warning, which is very different from liking a book for its merits as a literary work.)(4) The protagonist. The protagonist is easily influenced to the point of not being a driving force in her own life, all while being 100% bright-eyed and naive. The choice to cast a young woman (only two years out of college) as this malleable protagonist is misguided and invites criticism, especially with the national dialogues happening around women's rights AND since this is Eggers first full-length book to center around a female character. Those issues aside, the paper-thin Mae has only one driving force as the book goes on: being liked. While this could be a conscious comment on the Facebook generation, it doesn't make for a good character. There is little to make us care about the vapid protagonist or the missteps she continuously makes throughout the book. Not caring about her makes it difficult to identify with her, which (a) means Mae's naivete gives this would-be cautionary tale an abundantly obvious direction and (b) makes it unlikely people will see Mae's story as their own being lived out through (i) Facebook's ever-changing privacy policies, (ii) their own choice in how to respond to Google's growing ubiquity/power and (iii) the self-induced pressures of cultivating an active ""life"" online. Though she is cautious about many of her first steps into something new, feeling pressured to continue, it isn't long before she is running blindly into the next step of cult-like brainwashing.(In a totally unnecessary subplot, she even goes so far as to crave an unfulfilled sex life with a her emotionally limp partner Francis.) It is frustrating to realize that she never stands up for herself...at least it was until I realized she doesn't seem to have anything to stand up for. Mae is so easily manipulated by the powers that be at the Circle that it is difficult to acknowledge her as a sentient being.(5) The dialogue. So much time is spent showing the growing pressures and power of the Circle that it is a wonder that any time is spent telling what is happening, as it is so frequently through characters voicing aloud their intentions/motives/feelings. The writing in these moments are fully-articulated viewpoints one could cut and paste into an Op-Ed piece. The characters of Eamon Bailey and Mercer have all the subtlety of Ayn Rand's Howard Rourke but with none of the appeal. Plus, other characters enter the story for no reason other than to offer another somewhat obvious glimpse of the repercussions of an entity like the Circle (e.g. a drunken zealot who stumbles in to encourage the Circle to use its powers to create uniform morality).(6) The spineless masses. As written, it is totally unbelievable that everyone would go along with each step, much less with such evangelical enthusiasm. What is motivating them to agree and cheer each time their privacy is stripped away? Mercer is the first voice of reason at page 260 or so, which is (a) ridiculous and (b) poorly conceived since he and Mae are mid-argument when the usually-short-on-words Mercer waxes articulate philosophical viewpoints. (This does, however, manifest itself into the only idea I encountered that was new to me: that the biggest disconnect for people in their small, public activities online is that individually most people aren't doing anything wrong, but they are not conscious of the effect collectively.)(7) Numerous set-ups that lead to nothing. These are just off the top of my head: Mae's survey answer that forced her to answer positively, the documented activities Mae took part in that she would prefer to have kept hidden never came back to haunt her post-transparency, the secrecy around Kalden that had so intrigued/irritated Annie that she conveniently forgets, the people who are blackballed/convicted/framed for voicing opposition to the Circle, the entire motif of Mae's private trips to go kayaking that is ignored completely by the end of Book I. It's Chekhov's worst nightmare: So many guns hanging on the wall; none of them fired.(8) The artwork. Sorry to nitpick, but even this completely lacks subtlety: On the dust jacket is the Circle's logo, a C or a circle not yet complete. Take off the dust jacket and one sees that the circle is complete and it has become a target. Insert cutting remark here.There are even more things I personally didn't like about the book.There was one small detail: the recurring sort-of symbol of Mae feeling a tearing within, which wasn't the least bit poetic.Larger structural opinions: I wish the book had dropped us in the middle of things at the start of Book II, rather than spending the first 300 pages focusing on a newcomer being slowly introduced to the world of the Circle. As is, it aims to illustrate the slow progression to total acceptance that an employee of the Circle might go through, but it fails because Mae expresses little-to-no inner-struggle with all that is expected of her. Book II's aquarium motif: What will a vicious shark do? Not hard to guess. But at least the book spells out what the incredibly obvious symbol means. (I wasn't sure at times what to be more angry about: the book's obvious symbols or the fact they were all spelled out.)The two ""mysterious"" people: One is a nameless mystery. The other is a hooded figure whose whereabouts are unknown. Was anyone the least bit surprised?Lastly, I found it a strange choice that the book only warns of the bad things to come from the Circle taking full control, but never actually shows these fears becoming a reality (except for the few people who voice opposition and are targeted, something that only happens early in the book). I believe this was a conscious choice, but it makes the entire book an unfulfilled set-up, which might've worked were the book better....But those are just opinions, not exactly ones I could support in a bullet point. Still felt like voicing, though.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18302455-the-circle
The Passage;Justin Cronin;2010;2010;784;4.05;214891;yes;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Vampires', 'Dystopia'];IT HAPPENED FAST.THIRTY-TWO MINUTES FOR ONE WORLD TO DIE, ANOTHER TO BE BORN.First, the unthinkable: a security breach at a secret U.S. government facility unleashes the monstrous product of a chilling military experiment. Then, the unspeakable: a night of chaos and carnage gives way to sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world, forever altered. All that remains for the stunned survivors is the long fight ahead and a future ruled by fear—of darkness, of death, of a fate far worse.As civilization swiftly crumbles into a primal landscape of predators and prey, two people flee in search of sanctuary. FBI agent Brad Wolgast is a good man haunted by what he's done in the line of duty. Six-year-old orphan Amy Harper Bellafonte is a refugee from the doomed scientific project that has triggered apocalypse. Wolgast is determined to protect her from the horror set loose by her captors, but for Amy, escaping the bloody fallout is only the beginning of a much longer odyssey—spanning miles and decades—toward the time and place where she must finish what should never have begun.With The Passage, award-winning author Justin Cronin has written both a relentlessly suspenseful adventure and an epic chronicle of human endurance in the face of unprecedented catastrophe and unimaginable danger. Its inventive storytelling, masterly prose, and depth of human insight mark it as a crucial and transcendent work of modern fiction.;"Later, Keith Olbermann’s words, “WORST PERSON IN THE WO-O-R-R-L-L-D!!!” would echo in my head.The other morning, my daughter called, crying, and said, “I just did something terrible.”I froze. As a parent, these words could mean anything. I waited.“I hit a car. I was trying to move over because the street was narrow. I hit someone’s mirror. I panicked. I just took off. I’m late for work already. They’ll fire me if I’m late. I know I damaged the mirror. I feel awful.” This was all delivered in pieces, as she was weeping by now.During this, I go into parental stream of consciousness: ""Thank God. No one’s hurt. She’s not hurt. She left the scene. What does that mean? What do I do? What do I do? Trouble? Fines? Tickets? Jail? Oh my God. Money. Trouble, Money, money, money. Trouble, trouble, trouble.... ...Then, the devil’s words: Did anyone see you?But that’s not what I said. I heard myself say, “Can you go back and leave a note on the windshield?”More wailing, “Noooo. I’m late now. They’ll fire me. I know it.”“All right. Okay. You have to report this. I’ll find out what you need to do. It’s okay. Go to work. It’ll be okay.”Of course, I had no idea if it would be all right. I’m in Wisconsin; she’s in Minneapolis, and I started to make phone calls. The first officer was a huge help. He said he didn’t know what the rules were, but she’d LEFT THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT. I said she panicked, she feels terrible, she’s sobbing. He said, “It doesn’t matter whether she's crying, laughing, smiling. She LEFT THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT. That’s a crime.” My heart was pounding, and I wanted to say, “Look you Neanderthal fuck. She killed a mirror. Could you be human for a moment?”An hour or so later, I finally reached the right people, and the sergeant assured me she was not in trouble, took my name, number and hers, and said she should report it as soon as possible.…Situation handled, I suppose. But I kept thinking of my first thought, and what I almost said, Did anyone see you? Epic fail.I’m drawn to apocalyptic fiction, and one of the reasons why is that characters are often tested, and The Passage is no exception. Faced with temptation or in the clutch of terror, characters succeed or fail. While the book has compelling moments, too often Cronin starts to develop a character but never really completes the task. With such a large array of characters, this needs to be done. You want to empathize with the characters, and they need to be distinct enough so that you can keep them all straight.One problem – and this may sound minor – but it drove me crazy, was Cronin’s inability to handle dialogue. With the exception of the soldiers, who spoke in an exaggerated military fashion, many of the characters sounded the same. Also, they seemed to have one expletive: flyers, which referred to something horrible in their midst. Accordingly, most of the characters, when excited, would begin a sentence by saying, “Flyers, what will we do?” or “Flyers, did you see anything?” It was absurd.Picture, for example, something horrible in our lives. Sarah Palin, for example, and then picture her being able to survive, as she is, for decades.  Would we all suddenly start using “Palins” as our only expletive, and then placing this word only at the beginning of a sentence? “Palins, hot enough for you?” or “Palins, we should get moving!”No, for starters, though Palin has been on the international scene just shy of two years, we’ve been pretty creative in coming up with variations on her name: ~ Caribou Barbie~Failin’ Palin~the Thrilla from Wasilla~Palin bailin’~Bible Spice~Deranged asshat (…sorry, that’s just me)Imagine the variations we’d conjure up after decades. Just why Cronin thought having most of his characters use this one expletive (flyers) baffled me, but I also started to wince every time someone used it. I wanted to like this book. I’m a sucker for apocalyptic books where science-screws-up-big-time, starting with books as intellectually thoughtful as Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein right down to Richard Preston’s The Hot Zone. And, the book gets off to a good start. The first third of the book is quite good—the plot moves forward, and characters are developed.Then, you reach Part III, which begins with a long military report that sucks out whatever momentum the book had attained. And Cronin does this sort of thing far too often. He’ll get the plot moving and then deaden it by letting a military report or pages and pages of someone’s diary (in italics! I hate fucking italics!) stand in for the plot he should have developed. This is poor writing, poor pacing, and piss-poor editing. For a couple hundred pages, the book crawls. It gets into gear in spurts, which are again deadened with dull reports or italicized diaries. Cronin’s book, which had promise, lacks the rich characterization needed for such a long book, fails to sustain momentum, and has moments – particularly at the beginning of new sections - of horribly overwritten passages, such as this sentence fairly early in the book, which introduces Chapter Fifteen:”When all time ended, and the world had lost its memory, and the man that he was had receded from view like a ship sailing away, rounding the blade of the earth with his old life locked in its hold; when the gyring stars gazed down upon nothing…”This sentence, already painful, continues for another 37 words.Worst book in the world? Not at all. Cronin has talent, which he needs to develop, and—most of all—he needs to learn how to pace a novel, and not cheat by having climactic scenes told in the form of dry reports or diary entries.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6690798-the-passage
The Darkest Minds;Alexandra Bracken;2012;2010;488;4.16;196122;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fiction', 'Paranormal'];When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed. Something alarming enough to make her parents lock her in the garage and call the police. Something that gets her sent to Thurmond, a brutal government “rehabilitation camp.” She might have survived the mysterious disease that’s killed most of America’s children, but she and the others have emerged with something far worse: frightening abilities they cannot control.Now sixteen, Ruby is one of the dangerous ones.When the truth comes out, Ruby barely escapes Thurmond with her life. Now she’s on the run, desperate to find the one safe haven left for kids like her—East River. She joins a group of kids who escaped their own camp. Liam, their brave leader, is falling hard for Ruby. But no matter how much she aches for him, Ruby can’t risk getting close. Not after what happened to her parents.When they arrive at East River, nothing is as it seems, least of all its mysterious leader. But there are other forces at work, people who will stop at nothing to use Ruby in their fight against the government. Ruby will be faced with a terrible choice, one that may mean giving up her only chance at a life worth living.;"If The Hunger Games brought back my faith in YA dystopia, Darkest Minds made me an atheist. This book has a plot filled with more holes than a Dunkin Donuts. It is mind-boggling to me that the rating in this series is as high as Hunger Games when the supporting characters in this book are are without personality nor complexity, combined with a weak-ass, whiny wimp of a main character, not to mention the majority of a book is a pointless snoozefest of a roadtrip. Let's for 1 minute talk about The Hunger Games. The world is well-developed, well thought out, and honestly, the best thing about that series for me lies in Katniss' personality and strength of character (let's just forget Mockingjay ever happened *curls up into a ball and weeps*).The events in this book just plain don't make any damned sense. And not as in the whole ""What?! There's no way hundreds of thousands of kids could just DIE out of nowhere and then some develop psychic powers!"" No. Believing that that event could happen is a willing suspension of disbelief, one that every reader accepts. This book had me in disbelief.Take, for instance, the whole ""Shit, our kids are either dying or turning into the X-Men (they're not mutants, but you get the point)"" thing. Hundreds of thousands of kids are dying. The government's solution: LOCK UP THE SURVIVORS WHO COULD BE DANGEROUS.What the FUCK, why?!Granted, the government isn't the most rational of entities, but let's think of it this way. To be a little clichéd, the young is the future. There's a Social Security crisis right now because there are too many old people who need support and not enough of the working young giving tax dollars to support them. Same with developing countries. More young people = more workers.Therefore, my reasonable mind comes up with these few questions:1. Why the fuck is the government locking up the future? No kids means no population growth (unless you do mass test tube babies or something and we ain't that advanced yet) -> decline of a country. Yeah, I don't think our government is that stupid. Or at least, I hope not.2. Why the fuck is the government overreacting when they don't even know if these kids are dangerous? I mean some of the Oranges can read minds. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT THAT'S PRETTY FUCKING USEFUL. THEY SHOULD BE TRAINING HER FOR THE FUCKING CIA, AM I RIGHT? Best spy ever! But noooooooooo, they ship them away and lock them up as dangerous. Doesn't make any fucking sense.Then, when the kids are in the camp. They just bend over and take it because they're poor little helpless kids.Not.Please. We saw one of the kids make a security guard shoot herself in the mouth. The kids are strong, they clearly have powers. Why just take the abuse when they can easily free themselves?!Makes no fucking sense.And then there's Ruby. I hate Ruby so much. Her level of whine in this book made Katniss in Mockingjay look strong and tough in comparison. Wah wah wah. Wah wah wah. I have strong superpowers. Wah wah wah I'm a monster. Wah wah wah I'm unnatural. Fuck you.Maybe it's just me, but wouldn't having mental powers be the coolest thing in the world? Imaging the evil and havoc I could wreak (I could do good, but that ain't my thing). I want a character who embraces her own strength. I want a character who matures through her weakness. All Ruby ever does is whine, whine, whine. I'm sick of her pitiful, maryred mewlings.The Bad Guys have no personality. They have no complexity. They're there to abuse and hurt and nothing else. There is nothing human in them, and that's just unbelievable. This book was a waste of time.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10576365-the-darkest-minds
Bird Box;Josh Malerman;2014;2010;272;4.04;193943;yes;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Science Fiction'];Something is out there, something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse of it, and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remains, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now that the boy and girl are four, it's time to go, but the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children's trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. Something is following them all the while, but is it man, animal, or monster?Interweaving past and present, Bird Box is a snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.;"this is an incredibly original horror/psychological suspense novel that reminds us that with all great horror, the unseen is so much more terrifying than the seen. this is why japanese horror movies are so effective. they don't rely on graphic special effects to build the suspense, and the way they manipulate shadows, sounds, and background space creates an unparalleled atmosphere that leaves a more lasting, haunting impression than ""crazy chainsaw-toting psychopath"" splatter films. which, don't get me wrong, are also super-entertaining. Bird Box takes place after an eerie phenomenon begins to occur on a global scale. starting in russia, moving to alaska, and eventually making its way to ""a nice suburb of Detroit"" where our story picks up, people begin to see…something. no one knows what this ""something"" is, because once it has been seen, it drives people to madness and suicide, frequently with some homicides along the way. people begin boarding up their windows, blackening their windshields, and staying away from other people. there is no way of knowing what this ""something"" wants, where it came from, what form it takes, or what the future of humanity will be.malorie is living in a house with two children, both only four years old. from the time of their birth, she has been training ""boy"" and ""girl"" to live in this new world, making them wear blindfolds outside and putting them through rigorous tests to train them until they have the preternatural hearing of bats. all this preparation is for the day they will finally leave the house and try to find others, to find a safer place to live. the story is told in alternating chapters between malorie ""now"" and malorie at the beginning of the event, finding out she is pregnant just as the world begins to collapse.we don't learn much about the origin of the event, but we do get to witness how people respond to the experience, which for me and my survival bent is book-gold. this book does tension and people-thrown-into-isolated-community so, so well. under the dome, take notes.how terrifying is it to not be able to see?? to hear a noise right behind you and not know what it is?? to leave a safe house to forage for food and not be certain you will ever find your way back?? to drive a car blindfolded through corpse-studded roads and not know if you will hit a pole or fall into a ditch?? to determine what is danger and what is just a leaf falling? this is the best kind of building, creeping horror, and the writing is perfectly suited to the story. it is maddening at times when you want to be able to ""see"" what is happening, but you are at the mercy of the characters' limited vision. impeccably done.and that attic scene?? holy shit - that was so freaking intense. i still have a handful of minor questions (and one very major one) but they don't detract from my overall positive impression of the book. the premise alone gives it an edge over most horror novels, because it has been a long time since i have come across anything ""new"" in that genre, and you cannot beat the killer, page-turning suspense.debut novel from a musician?? quit your day job, friend.come to my blog!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44646576-bird-box

Thunderhead;Neal Shusterman;2018;2010;504;4.39;192968;yes;['Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Romance'];Rowan has gone rogue, and has taken it upon himself to put the Scythedom through a trial by fire. Literally. In the year since Winter Conclave, he has gone off-grid, and has been striking out against corrupt scythes—not only in MidMerica, but across the entire continent. He is a dark folk hero now—“Scythe Lucifer”—a vigilante taking down corrupt scythes in flames.Citra, now a junior scythe under Scythe Curie, sees the corruption and wants to help change it from the inside out, but is thwarted at every turn, and threatened by the “new order” scythes. Realizing she cannot do this alone—or even with the help of Scythe Curie and Faraday, she does the unthinkable, and risks being “deadish” so she can communicate with the Thunderhead—the only being on earth wise enough to solve the dire problems of a perfect world. But will it help solve those problems, or simply watch as perfection goes into decline?;Edit 4/7 - After raving about this book for a video review (which you can find here: https://youtu.be/diBtmttjbSs), I decided to raise my rating to 5 stars. Despite that I didn't enjoy Thunderhead EXACTLY as much as Scythe, I feel the book itself is nearly flawless and one of the greatest YA books on the market. This story is too well-written for me to be comfortable giving it any less of a rating.A very satisfying sequel!! I didn’t enjoy Thunderhead AS MUCH as Scythe (It is a TOUGH book to follow up) but it was still a great novel!!I definitely enjoyed seeing how the world of the Scythedom expanded after the conclusion of Scythe. Conflicts deepen, the Scythe divides even further, and there are even more questions introduced on how the Scythedom should be conducted! Also, there is a lot of political intrigue added in the sequel, which I thoroughly enjoyed. As my favorite part of book one was the world, I’m very pleased with how it has continued to develop through the sequel.Thunderhead introduces a new main character named Grayson into the story who we follow through some previously uncharted territory. While I grew to like Grayson by the end, I wasn’t overjoyed by his introduction to the story. I did not care for him nearly as much as Citra and Rowan and I felt his presence overtook much of the story. I understand the need for his perspective in providing insight on other parts of the story ARC, but it wasn’t my favorite element.Finally, the ending was PHENOMENAL. I cannot begin to speculate on how book three will move forward with all of the events that happened within the last few chapters of the book. A seriously well done ending with some fantastic cliffhangers. The ending absolutely made up for some of my lesser-favorite parts of the book.Overall, I enjoyed Thunderhead. There is definitely a bit of “second-book syndrome” going on, but overall a good sequel. I would totally recommend continuing with this series if you enjoyed Scythe!!I received a free copy of this book from Simon & Schuster as a part of a paid YouTube campaign. I had no obligation to review this book as a part of that campaign and all opinions are my own.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555224-thunderhead

I had existed whole years without her, but that was all it had been. An existence. A book with no words.""Tom Hazard has just moved back to London, his old home, to settle down and become a high school history teacher. And on his first day at school, he meets a captivating French teacher at his school who seems fascinated by him. But Tom has a dangerous secret. He may look like an ordinary 41-year-old, but owing to a rare condition, he's been alive for centuries. Tom has lived history--performing with Shakespeare, exploring the high seas with Captain Cook, and sharing cocktails with Fitzgerald. Now, he just wants an ordinary life.Unfortunately for Tom, the Albatross Society, the secretive group which protects people like Tom, has one rule: Never fall in love. As painful memories of his past and the erratic behavior of the Society's watchful leader threaten to derail his new life and romance, the one thing he can't have just happens to be the one thing that might save him. Tom will have to decide once and for all whether to remain stuck in the past, or finally begin living in the present.How to Stop Time tells a love story across the ages--and for the ages--about a man lost in time, the woman who could save him, and the lifetimes it can take to learn how to live. It is a bighearted, wildly original novel about losing and finding yourself, the inevitability of change, and how with enough time to learn, we just might find happiness.Soon to be a major motion picture starring Benedict Cumberbatch.";"I guess I should straight off the bat tell you what happened when I finished reading ""The Humans."" And yes, I know this is supposed to be a review about ""How to Stop Time."" Bear with me. So, I finished ""The Humans"" and I a)wept b) started it again immediately c) spent the next two years giving it to everyone on my gift list and basically insisting everyone read it. My ace in the hole has always been this - ""If the road gets rocky (and everyone's road gets rocky sometimes) I can re-read ""The Humans"" and I'll feel that feeling again, that I'm not alone, that there is hope, that there is goodness."" Okay, enough about ""The Humans"" and I write this as an unabashedly huge fan of the way Matt Haig puts words on paper. Let me tell you about ""How to Stop Time."" Wait. No. You know, I read a lot of reviews here on ""Goodreads"" and think wow, bingo, right on, so well done! I really admire reviewers who are able to articulate what often just feels like a jumble in my own mind over a reaction to a book. You don't need me to tell you what this novel is about, that blurb is up top there, right by the book. See? Yeah. It's about that. One of my friends went to the London Book Fair and scored an advance copy. Because she's one of the people I encouraged (forced/insisted/wrangled int0) reading ""The Humans"" and she also fell in love with the book, she came to my work and dropped off the newest novel last week. In. My. Hands. I'm serious. I could see it in her eyes, I could see it, I barely could function for the rest of my shift and I wrapped it up so it would not get anything on it at all. She said, ""You know how you loved ""The Humans,"" right?"" I nodded. She said, ""Well, he was just clearing his throat. Wait until you go into this one."" Can you imagine? Can you? Try. Think kind of shaky, breath a bit rapid and shallow, scared and excited, all at the same time.I (get this) PUT IT ASIDE for six days. There must be an award somewhere for this. Get it for me. I deserve it. I wanted a day where I had no work to go to and so I waited. That day was yesterday. I got up and ate the oatmeal pretty quickly. I made the tea. I sat in my chair. Aside from tea breaks (during which I drank the tea fast and ran back to my chair - picture the menopausal sweaty woman in track pants and polar fleece because it's still SNOWING here these days) - and I read and I read and I read. I nodded so much I looked like one of those little plastic dogs you have seen if you are of a certain age that used to be in the back of cars, those nodding plastic dogs. Did their eyes light up? Maybe some did. The posh ones. So I nodded and I nodded and I nodded. And I wept. And I laughed. And I finished the last page.You know, there's lot of clever authors. There are. Good with words. Big brains. Able to both craft and execute a complex plot line. They're out there. I've read their books. Many of them. Books have been my sustenance for a very long time (but now also fishing and billiards of late). This is what I think. Matt Haig's huge heart (and it may well be the biggest one I've encountered) is equally matched by his huge mind. He cares so deeply. He cares about us, we humans. He cares because we suffer. He cares because we try, we try. And fall down and try again. He has such a far-reaching compassion for humanity that I sit here and think to myself, how can I ever begin to tell you, reader people? How can I tell you? The world is a much softer place for me because of these two novels. My friend was right, the one who loaned me this novel. You'll see, you'll see how this one came into being, how his mind works. It seems so simple really to ponder what he says... what if we were kind? What if we were brave? What if we really let ourselves care? I sent an email to my friend (she asked for one word of what I thought, I'm taking her to dinner in April so we can discuss it properly)...""I wept.I felt like he wrote it just for me.I am sure many people will feel that, yes?""She said:""Yes, they will.You summed it up perfectly.

GREAT ALIEN BALLS OF FIRE!I must warn you, Onyx drips with sexual tension. Just when I thought the witty banter between Daemon and Kat couldn't get any better, I was bitch-slapped with betterness! How can you not love a book with words like ""dickdom"" and ""craptastic"" or a phrase like, ""my boobs just might come out and say hello tonight."" When I wasn't having a total bookgasm for Daemon, I was laughing out loud!! The pace of the story is perfection. Often times, a book starts off great and climaxes great (insert immature giggle here), but suffers from ""saggy middle syndrome"". There is nothing saggy about Daemon Onyx. We don't get jipped with a ""filler"" sequel thats only purpose is to transition into book three. We get a sequel that blows away the first! Jennifer takes everything that was good about Obsidian and does it ten times better! So ladies...send the kids to grandma's, lock up the husbands, break up with the boyfriends because you're spending the night with Daemon. In fact, I actually think I may be impregnated with a tiny alien baby just by reading Onyx. Jennifer L.

Reached;Ally Condie;2012;2010;512;3.54;170140;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Teen'];After leaving Society to desperately seek The Rising, and each other, Cassia and Ky have found what they were looking for, but at the cost of losing each other yet again. Cassia is assigned undercover in Central city, Ky outside the borders, an airship pilot with Indie. Xander is a medic, with a secret. All too soon, everything shifts again.;"In a word, dull. Dull and boring. **MINOR SPOILERS** What should have been a bigger event in this book - the Rising fighting the Society - ended up being nothing. At first I honestly thought that maybe my book was missing several chapters - you know, the chapters where something actually happens - but it turns out that the Rising taking over the Society was just that - nothing. There's no action, no suspense, no anything. By the end of the book, I didn't care about Ky, Xander, or Cassia, although it all ended rather predictably for all three of them. I also thought the book was overly vague. Sometimes leaving things vague and trying to create a great symbolism works really well for books, but in this book it actually worked against it. From the jobs (still don't know what the heck a ""sorter"" is and why computers can't do it) to the ""Society"" and the ""Rising"" - everything is just so vague. I also didn't understand how Ky and Indie suddenly became the best trained pilots there ever was or how Xander got medical training so quickly. I could go on about the flaws of this book, but honestly it's hard to even describe the flaws since it's almost impossible to find specific concrete details. Overall, not a *terrible* book, I like the way the author tries to interweave the poetry, but in the end, disappointing.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13125947-reached
Caliban’s War;James S.A. Corey;2012;2010;624;4.38;160735;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy'];We are not alone. On Ganymede, breadbasket of the outer planets, a Martian marine watches as her platoon is slaughtered by a monstrous supersoldier. On Earth, a high-level politician struggles to prevent interplanetary war from reigniting. And on Venus, an alien protomolecule has overrun the planet, wreaking massive, mysterious changes and threatening to spread out into the solar system.In the vast wilderness of space, James Holden and the crew of the Rocinante have been keeping the peace for the Outer Planets Alliance. When they agree to help a scientist search war-torn Ganymede for a missing child, the future of humanity rests on whether a single ship can prevent an alien invasion that may have already begun . . .;Interconnection is everythingI´ve recently finished the ninth part and I must say that the immense coherency, precision in plotting, and meta context are so fine tuned that it is a joy to read. The effort to polish this until perfection without hardly any logic holes, lengths, and errors and to stay comprehensible must be immense and I must say that I´ve rarely ever seen something like that in Sci-Fi because it´s such a difficult task. That´s how it often goesMostly, the novels of a series are closed in themselves and there are not so many retrospects and connections because it can get too complicated. Peter F Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds, Banks, and some others come close, but Hamilton is the only one with similar interconnections and great character development. It´s not just that the events, fractions, and happenings of the previous parts are used for reminiscences, the whole power balance, allies, and economic motivations change and keep both the honest, direct war and the hidden, political messes and backstabbings evolving. In such cases I like to imagine the storyboard with context and lines in different colors, metaplots, subplots,… and how complex and interwoven it must be for the creators standing in front and, while writing, in their work and expanding it, pun intended.All that makes sci fi great in one packageAnd there is everything, the war, supersoldiers, rebel fractions, big questions about the alien technology, mixed quantum fantasy elements, the highly recommended function of putting the name of the character whose POV is described in front of each chapter to get quicker and directer suspense without the need of explaining where we are, extreme attention on the detailed and realistic description of ship design, physics, life in space,... perfect balance of technobabble, harmless infodumps, tons of tropes, credible characters who are great for constructing inner and outer conflicts, unbelievable worldbuilding, sense of wonder en masse, just everything is done completely right to write one of the greatest space operas ever. One doesn´t have to be a sci fi nerd to enjoy itEven people who aren´t so in Sci-Fi can read it just because of the characters, like someone who reads Game of Thrones because of an interest in the protagonists and not because of medieval times, magic, and stuff. I think that sci-fi needed something like that, away from the, for an average audience, too complex hard sci-fi, the too slow and less explosive social sci-fi, too indodumpy and tech-focused cyberpunk, and the general very long and complex novels of many other authors. Side by side together on the legendary shelveOne of the reasons why this series is so great may lie in the cooperation of the authors, that the weaknesses, if there are any, of the one can be compensated by the other and that everyone writes the stuff he is best at. This practice could get interesting in the future, not just with more and more collaborations to produce high-quality content, but with collaborative writing in a fictional social cataloging network, let´s call it goodbook. Whose inhabitants could, with the help of the book adaptability quote, become professional at escalating the whole thing very quickly, because the knowledge and experience of thousands of readers of specific genres are immense and the one or other might have already played with the thought of writing something, but has problems with the plot or the characters or the twists or… is just a lazy as heck procrastinating slacker. Ahem Nom nom in spaceGrowing food in space is a tricky thing, even with advantages such as permanent solar energy and sunshine or someday taming and using the power of black holes, etc., but the side effect is the omnipresent danger of being a very attractive target in case of a war, of getting sabotaged or of errors, black swans, tiny imbalances that accumulate to a collapse of the food production. Personally, I would avoid direct sunlight, drill deep inside asteroids, dwarf planets, or planets and build underground farming complexes, avoiding most dangers this way and focusing on a mix of bioreactors and farming, to have 2 independent food production lines in case of catastrophes.Necromanced vomit zombies. In space!Zombies in space that vomit, what else could one´s heart wish for? But seriously, the average umbrella corporation zombie reason with out of control bioweapons can be greatly extended when one goes to space. Be it parasites, symbionts, programs converting all biological mass into something more useful for them, mind control,... it´s always great fun.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: This series has some of the most amazing and massive tropeicaltiy t I´ve ever seen.https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12591698-caliban-s-war
The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet;Becky  Chambers;2014;2010;518;4.18;157133;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy'];Follow a motley crew on an exciting journey through space-and one adventurous young explorer who discovers the meaning of family in the far reaches of the universe-in this light-hearted debut space opera from a rising sci-fi star.Rosemary Harper doesn’t expect much when she joins the crew of the aging Wayfarer. While the patched-up ship has seen better days, it offers her a bed, a chance to explore the far-off corners of the galaxy, and most importantly, some distance from her past. An introspective young woman who learned early to keep to herself, she’s never met anyone remotely like the ship’s diverse crew, including Sissix, the exotic reptilian pilot, chatty engineers Kizzy and Jenks who keep the ship running, and Ashby, their noble captain.Life aboard the Wayfarer is chaotic and crazy—exactly what Rosemary wants. It’s also about to get extremely dangerous when the crew is offered the job of a lifetime. Tunneling wormholes through space to a distant planet is definitely lucrative and will keep them comfortable for years. But risking her life wasn’t part of the plan. In the far reaches of deep space, the tiny Wayfarer crew will confront a host of unexpected mishaps and thrilling adventures that force them to depend on each other. To survive, Rosemary’s got to learn how to rely on this assortment of oddballs—an experience that teaches her about love and trust, and that having a family isn’t necessarily the worst thing in the universe.;10 reasons I love The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet:1. Feel-good science fiction. Bad things happen. Injustice exists. And yet, the world is a mostly beautiful and good place. Bad people exist, but people in general are mostly nice and almost always interesting. It’s a truly heart-warming novel.2. It’s a great big world. There are all these interesting alien species, with interesting cultures and history which affect their society. If you love well-written settings where the lore isn’t a bunch of facts but is actually a huge factor in the plot, you will like this.3. Great characters. This is a character-driven story. Every crew member matters and is made interesting and memorable. This isn’t a story about the Chosen One saving the galaxy. This is the story of the crew on a ship that builds traffic routes. Sure, they’re a rather unique bunch, but ultimately there are a lot of ships like theirs and a lot of equally interesting destinies in the galaxy.4. Great female characters. I’m not quite sure who I like more - the badass pilot, the smart but inexperienced clerk or the mechanic who spreads joy around her and keeps the ship from exploding. Or maybe that male crewmember’s love interest, who is the captain of a military freight ship and has more scars than her boyfriend. Or maybe the many women mentioned in passing who have agency and are out there doing things. Researchers, soldiers, doctors, ship captains, cult members, pilots, mechanics, traders, politicians…5. It’s anti-prejudice. It’s relaxing to read authors who actually like people. I read a lot, but it’s not often that I see a character think “wow, she’s weird - wait, that was a bit prejudiced of me.” It’s not just that, though. The world itself seems much less sexist, racist, homophobic and transphobic than today’s world. It’s a very relaxing world to get to inhabit for a while.6. Everyone isn’t white and straight. Tired of sci-fi and fantasy settings like that? Here, have a setting where most humans are people of color and where non-straight relationships really aren’t a big deal.7. Aliens who upset the gender binary. Some people use xe or they as pronouns. Some species change sex during their life time, going from female to male to neither. None of it is treated as weird or icky or annoying. This makes me very happy. Even in our world, gender’s a lot more complicated than “there are two sexes,” yet books are often “here are all these extraordinary species that are totally different from humans, yet every single being is still either male or female.”8. The aliens are strange, but so are the humans. Human culture is as interesting as the alien cultures. Human culture has actually been shaped by history. For example, the culture of the Exodus Fleet has a pacifistic streak, which has formed Ashby’s strong aversion to weapons. There’s also the fact that humans don’t have one unified culture - there are differences between Mars and the Exodus Fleet, as well as differences based on class and where you grew up.9. The clerk who kicks ass. As an academic, it makes me happy to see someone save the day more than once by being knowledgable, doing research and filling out the right forms.10. The author is very nice. Got a lore question? Send it to @beckysaysrawr on Twitter and get it answered. Becky Chambers is a writer, journalist, editor and all around cool person who seems very happy to talk to her fans.(11. I just spent waaay too long writing this post. Seriously, it’s unhealthy. I need food and my back is killing me. If that’s not proof I love this book, I don’t know what is.);https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22733729-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet

Now with enemy fire raining down on them, Kady and Ezra — who are barely even talking to each other—are forced to evacuate with a hostile warship in hot pursuit.But their problems are just getting started. A plague has broken out and is mutating with terrifying results; the fleet’s AI may actually be their enemy; and nobody in charge will say what’s really going on.

Some people love that stuff. I ain't one of them. I love space shit. Firefly. Star Wars (yes, EVEN THE NEWER ONES). Star Trek (I loved Enterprise and I don't care who knows it). This book was just terrible and terribly formatted.The first few chapters are entirely interviews. It was annoying as shit. It didn't endear me to the main characters, and it explain nothing. Interviews are nigh on useless for building a memorable introduction, unless it is in the hands of an extremely skilled writer. Not the case here.So right off we have an annoying girl who's thinking about her ex bf when the invasion occurred (huh?). I have no idea where we are. I have no idea what year it is. I don't know what a Kerenza whatever is.
Interviewer: Wait, you people had a subway system? I thought this settlement was illegal?Ezra Mason: Chum, the Kerenza mine operated undetected for twenty years. Whole families lived there. You know how far from the Core we are, right?
WHAT. THE. FUCK. IS. GOING. ON?Bad start. And it didn't get much better. After what seems like 10000000 pages of interviews, all of a sudden we're at war (still no idea where we are, what year it is, how we got here, etc.) and then young people are getting conscripted for the military.
Anyone showing C-grade ability or better is to be conscripted the day they hit eighteen. We need pilots. We need gunners. We need spanner monkeys and chipheads. And we need them now.This is an unprecedented situation—to my knowledge, no stellarcorp has ever openly attacked a United Terran Authority ship. I don’t care if BeiTech Industries’ litigation department has enough red tape to gift-wrap a small moon. These corporations need to learn nobody is above the law and nobody attacks a UTA vessel without consequences.
Yay.There are battle ships and specs of battle ships.Do I give a fuck? No, I don't. There are cool pictures. There are snippets of things I couldn't give two shits about. What I want is a sensible story, and I didn't get that here. I got a headache instead.By 30%, I still have no idea what the fuck is going on. I concede, my brain prefers structure. If you're into this stuff, good for you. It's just not for me.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23395680-illuminae
Artificial Condition;Martha Wells;2018;2010;160;4.27;154246;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Novella', 'Adult', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"It has a dark past--one in which a number of humans were killed. A past that caused it to christen itself “Murderbot."" But it has only vague memories of the massacre that spawned that title, and it wants to know more. Teaming up with a Research Transport vessel named ART (you don’t want to know what the “A” stands for), Murderbot heads to the mining facility where it went rogue. What it discovers will forever change the way it thinks.Alternate cover of ISBN 9781250186928. Another cover edition can be found here";"""I was stalling. I would have to interact with humans as an augmented human... I had imagined it as taking place from a distance, or in the spaces of a crowded transit ring. Interacting meant talking, and eye contact. I could already feel my performance capacity dropping.""It was with anticipation of pleasure that I picked up the second installment in the Murderbot series. After its thrilling adventures on its last expedition as a SecUnit, I was curious to see what 'Bot would do with freedom. I read quickly, finishing in one sitting. Though the beginning felt a bit awkward, I remained confident that Wells would end up somewhere interesting. It was an enjoyable read, but suffered from a few issues.Why not five stars, you wonder? I do enjoy the character of Murderbot a great deal, but found myself with some sticky points on my first read-through.One, I felt Murderbot had become more colloquial in its speech without accompanying change in comfort level with others. Calling A.R.T. an 'asshole,' for instance, seemed odd. Funny, no doubt. But would the apathetic Murderbot really have named a mildly intrusive artificial intelligence it just met an 'asshole?' It set the wrong tone and in some ways, the character of Murderbot backslid to be a socially inept human, not a killing machine trying to create behavior patterns.Two, I thought the narrative confusing at first. I'm quite used to Well's elaborate world-building, but this felt awkward. On re-read, I decided it was smoother than I had thought the first time through. I remain extremely puzzled as to the differences between 'constructs,' 'artificial intelligences,' and ''bots' in Murderbot's world and why humans created 'constructs' as they did. At one point 'Bot notes that ""the long sleeves of the T-shirt and jacket, the pants and the boots covering all my inorganic parts,"" which seemed especially weird to me. Why leave human hands on a construct? I also remained puzzled by lines such as ""I huddled in the chair."" Hello, Killing Machine? Why on earth do you have any hormones responsible for fear? I feel like Wells would have done better to stick with a Star Trek TNG 'Data' type model.Three, the plot was good, but uneven. Murderbot wants to see the scene of its alleged murders. It will need a pretext to get there, so it signs on with a group of naive workers hoping to regain some stolen data. This premise works at first until the workers, a family with young children, behave in incredibly naive and stupid ways, leading Murderbot to behave in naive and stupid ways. The long journey to the scene of the crime ends up being anticlimacticTo be fair, my rating might also be a case of high expectations; certainly it is much better than many 3-star books that I've read, enjoyed, and promptly forgot (basically every generic cop-thriller). I love much of what Martha Wells has done, and have a number of her books shelved in hardcover. Since I can still remember many of the details of Artificial Condition without picking up the book, it's good enough to make an impression. There's lots of humor and sarcasm, some sweet computer bonding and quite a bit of action. Definitely worth reading.Thanks to all the friends and commenters who helped me clarify my thoughts!November 2022: I think it's 5 stars. Although these are all novellas, the character growth really stands out when I read them back to back. 'Bot getting to explore independence and humanity is the best.Love the 'Bot and want to join a re/read? Discuss the upcoming release?

Doubting him isn’t something I’ll do again, and now that we’ve made it through the rough patches, well… There’s a lot of spontaneous combustion going on.But even he can’t protect his family from the danger of trying to free those they love.After everything, I’m no longer the same Katy. I’m different… And I’m not sure what that will mean in the end. When each step we take in discovering the truth puts us in the path of the secret organization responsible for torturing and testing hybrids, the more I realize there is no end to what I’m capable. The death of someone close still lingers, help comes from the most unlikely source, and friends will become the deadliest of enemies, but we won’t turn back.

A big trap for Daemon and Katy set by the DOD.Readers,you must have heard of the saying---‘Between the devil and the deep blue sea.’“We’d been blackmailed—trapped again,and what could we do?

Then he spun,planted his right hand on Blake’s shoulder,knocking him back into a locker. “See you around,” he said,smirking.”Yes,**sigh again**.That’s Daemon,ridiculously possessive. “I loathe Blake.He used me and was ready to turn me over to Daedalus.He killed Adam.There’s only a teeny tiny bit of me that can actually tolerate him.How can you even be any bit jealous of him?”“He wants you.”“Oh,dear God,he does not.”“Whatever.I’m a guy.I know what other guys are thinking.""Told you,ridiculously jealous.

Ice Planet Barbarians;Ruby Dixon;2015;2010;188;3.64;152972;yes;['Romance', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Aliens', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Erotica'];You'd think being abducted by aliens would be the worst thing that could happen to me. And you'd be wrong. Because now, the aliens are having ship trouble, and they've left their cargo of human women—including me—on an ice planet. And the only native inhabitant I've met? He's big, horned, blue, and really, really has a thing for me...;"Anyone who knows me knows that this is not the type of book I normally read. How, then, do I come to be reviewing it? Well, therein lays a tale… It all started innocently enough one night as I flipped idly through a dog-eared copy of The Collected Poems of John Keats, my eyes full of starry daydreams (even though it was nighttime). I heard a strange sound, felt my limbs grow heavy, my eyelids droop, and…The next thing I remember is groggily waking up to the sensation of something not-so-gently probing my backside, as though I’d awakened in the middle of a colonoscopy. I am not habitually awakened in this manner, so I immediately sensed something out of the ordinary was transpiring. That supposition was confirmed when I turned my head to the right and saw a 9-foot-tall tree-like creature sitting next to me, complete with shiny striations, leafy hair, perky acorn nipples and one heck of a knobby woody (if you will). Being an astute and keen observer of my immediate surroundings in the Sherlockian tradition, even in my foggy state of being, I surmised that this creature’s twig-like fingers were the source of my backdoor discomfort, mainly because I could see the creature’s twig-like fingers working my no-no hole like a Chinese finger trap.“Whoa!” I shouted, instantly alert, though whether that was a result of waking up to find that I was next to what I could only guess was an alien in the midst of a spaceship or being explored in a way no tree has ever had the temerity to undertake, I can’t say. “Rules of courtesy would suggest that you at least lubricate those things before you insert them,” I shouted. “Even better, maybe buy a guy a steak dinner first, huh?”“Etneke grekean elteeeiwn,” growled the creature.“I would rather you didn’t,” I replied, nonplussed.“Ceiten metlr burrge Ferbuglun grirbllwalp?""“No, I don’t speak Ferbuglun; I just hang out at dentist’s offices a lot. Listen to enough people mumbling their way around a drill and eventually you can translate pretty much anything.”(Author’s note: from this point on, I will present all dialogue in English instead of Ferbuglun, for ease of reading.)“What is a dentist?” asked the alien.“It’s not important. What IS important is that you’re making me exceedingly uncomfortable with your probing of my dark and stormy.”The alien frowned, his woody countenance not dissimilar from our own when perplexed. “How else am I to learn of humans?”“Oh, I don’t know…try a book first, maybe. Or, you could just ask. Frankly, you’re going to learn very little from sticking things up my manhole, other than perhaps what I had for dinner and whether or not I strain too much whilst in the process of passing excrement—and, to save you the trouble of probing any further, the answers are turkey sandwich and, yes, a little, though I’m working on it at my proctologist’s request.” I motioned toward my oaken friend’s exceedingly long appendage. “So, maybe you could back it out a little?”I relaxed as he sighed and complied with my request. “I do not understand how I err in my approach. I have probed hundreds of humans and have learned very little.”“Yeah, well, I think that’s because you’re coming at it from the wrong direction. I’m Sean, incidentally. And you are Mr….?”“Your unsophisticated binary gender constructs do not allow for me to properly express what I am. As such, your ‘Mr.’ is not a proper form of address. But, you may call me Gleeble.”“I’d say nice to meet you, Gleeble, but I would be lying. It’s really pretty terrible to have met you, at least under these circumstances.” Hmmm. What IS the right pronoun? It seems that the great writers—Ursula LeGuin in The Left Hand of Darkness, me in this review of Ice Planet Barbarians—are always struggling with gender and the limits of the English language. I’ll go with “it,” I guess. “So…what is it, exactly, that you’re trying to learn?”“My people are dying. For reasons unknown, our reproductive rate has decreased to an alarmingly low level. I have been tasked with determining whether humans will make suitable reproductive vessels.”“You’re not going to have a whole lot of luck producing saplings by knocking at the back door. And especially not on someone like me, who’s all man. ALL man.” “I see.” Gleeble reached over to a small table and picked up a book, which it began to flip through. “This tome, obtained from your planet, indicates a strong willingness on the part of the members of your female species to engage in sexual congress with aliens, even for the purposes of cross-species procreation.”He handed me a copy of Ice Planet Barbarians: The Complete Series: A SciFi Alien Serial Romance. I flipped through it briefly. “I’m not entirely sure this is the best basis for making that assumption. Besides, like I said, I’m a man.”“It is difficult to tell sometimes,” confessed Gleeble.“Okay, quick anatomy lesson. This dangly thing, hanging here, which would very much like to be covered up again? That’s a lady plugger, and the little things below it are giggleberries. Women don’t have those.”“I have studied many humans. Your…lady plugger is of similar size to the clitorati on your females.”“It’s…no, it’s not…similar size? What? First off, I don’t think that’s the proper plural of that word. Second, what kind of mutant clitorises are you looking at?”“In fact, your penile unit seems quite small compared to most…clitorises. Is that the correct word?”Uninvited clacker intrusion and small penis cracks. I hate aliens. “Well, whatever the case, I can’t bear children, and I don’t think this book is going to help you much.”“My superiors have requested a summary of it. Perhaps you can assist me in showing them that it is, perhaps, inaccurate?”I shrugged. It wasn’t like I had anywhere else to go, seeing as how we were zipping along at light speed. I took the book and began to read. A short time later, I set it down and looked at Gleeble, who had remained silently by my side, massaging itself with its twig fingers and making creaky moans on occasion. It was weird, but who am I to judge? I once got down with myself in the bathroom of an airplane while flying over international waters after a screening of Pretty Woman, so maybe it’s a travel thing.“All right, let’s talk about this book. Your first mistake is in taking it literally.”“What do you mean?” asked Gleeble.“It’s an allegory. An extended metaphor. It’s really a commentary on gender roles and identity in the post-Internet era as well as a scathing critique of the American class system, which is an unacknowledged but very real byproduct of discriminatory laws and social constructs. All of that massive alien schlonging is just a way of showing how much the American people get screwed over by their government.”“And what of when the alien Vektal masticates the earth woman’s birth canal until she achieves a state of orgasm? Does that not speak of an Earth woman’s arousal at the prospect of mating with a different species?”“Ew, God, no…don’t say it that way. When he tongue bangs her hoo-ha, it’s really just a way of showing how women are so frequently chewed up and spit out by a dominant, and misogynistic, corporate patriarchy.”Gleeble looked thoughtful. “So, you do not believe that Earth women would readily take my people into the warmest folds of their flesh to receive our mating seed and then incubate our larva for the 17-year gestational period our offspring require?”“Gleeble, my friend…have you ever talked to a woman in the third trimester of her pregnancy? Because if you haven’t, you really should before you consider extending that for another 16 and a quarter years.”“These are troubling revelations. We had been led to believe by a documentary film we obtained entitled ‘Earth Girls Are Easy’ that we had found the solution to our problem.”“Documentary?! That’s not a…good lord, Greeble. Look, here’s the bottom line: Earth is NOT the solution to your problem. Try Venus, maybe.” I handed the book to him. “I believe this is yours.” Gleeble gave me a quizzical look. “Why does your very small penile unit appear to be in a state of tumescence? I say ‘appear’ because its size has not noticeably increased, as I believe is common in the males of your species when aroused, though perhaps that is a result of its exceedingly tiny stature.”“Seriously, it’s not that small, and I’m not…not…” I could feel myself blushing. “Allegory or no, sometimes when a man reads about things like a weird alien guy paying lip service to a lovely lady, well, certain biochemical reactions take place that can’t be avoided.” I grimaced. “Shut up. And take me home.”It nodded. “You have been of considerable help. Normally, I eat the humans after I probe them, but I will return you to your domicile.”I breathed a sigh of relief. Gleeble wasn’t such a freakish alien perv after all. “Come here, you big lug—bring it in for the real thing,” I said. We embraced. “Oh, hey. Didn’t realize you had tentacles, too. Could you get them out of there, please?”“Okay,” said Gleeble sheepishly.“Mystery appendage, too—let’s have none of that. Leave my balloon knot alone.”“Sorry.”Sometime later, I woke up in my bed, drool covering my book of Keats poetry. I had a pounding headache and was a bit uncomfortable elsewhere, but otherwise unharmed. I was relieved to be home, but lamented the fact that the entire female population of the earth would never know that I’d just saved them from being concubines for massive, androgynous tree creatures. Of course, it’s not entirely out of the question that some of them would have been furious at me for denying them the opportunity. Women…always a mystery.

Requiem;Lauren Oliver;2013;2010;391;3.73;150428;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook'];Now an active member of the resistance, Lena has transformed. The nascent rebellion that was underway in Pandemonium has ignited into an all-out revolution in Requiem, and Lena is at the center of the fight. After rescuing Julian from a death sentence, Lena and her friends fled to the Wilds. But the Wilds are no longer a safe haven. Pockets of rebellion have opened throughout the country, and the government cannot deny the existence of Invalids. Regulators infiltrate the borderlands to stamp out the rebels.As Lena navigates the increasingly dangerous terrain of the Wilds, her best friend, Hana, lives a safe, loveless life in Portland as the fiancée of the young mayor.Requiem is told from the perspectives of both Lena and her friend Hana. They live side by side in a world that divides them until, at last, their stories converge.;"That was awful. Completely awful. Holy hell. What happened?Summary of Requiem: Lena leads Julian on to make Alex jealous. That's it. That's the whole book.Lena... what happened to you? You were bland in Delirium, had this AMAZING character growth in Pandemonium, and here? You were petty and whiny and annoying. Criminy. She asked to leave behind a burned, injured, defenseless girl who had just lost her home and family all because she was jealous that Alex talked to her. Way to be a shitty person, Lena!The Lena/Hana back and forth POV chapters were okay. Hana's story was better than Lena's story. At least Hana had some character development, unlike anyone else in the book. I didn't even like Lena anymore. Her character growth from the second book was basically stomped out. Instead of character development, she had recession of character development. Julian was totally forgettable here, his only purpose being to make Alex jealous for Lena and not having any further character development either. Guess it was all used up in Pandemonium. (SUCH GOOD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN PANDEMONIUM!!!! WHAT HAPPENED HERE HOLY BALLS).Oh, and there was Alex. Alex, who was a HUGE ASSHOLE THE ENTIRE BOOK. Oh, he wanted to give Lena up and let her go so he decided to lie and hurt her at every chance he got and be a huge asshole instead. HOW SELF-SACRIFICING!!!! BUT NOPE ALL IS FORGIVEN BECAUSE HE LEFT A NOTE THAT SAID FORGIVE ME AND HE STILL LOVES HER!!!! (TOLD TO LENA BY HIS TWO-SECOND GIRLFRIEND THAT HE PROBABLY GOT JUST TO KEEP LENA AWAY AND HURT HER MORE.) THAT EXCUSES EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!And because Alex/Lena are endgame during the last five pages of the book, why not just make sure the book is chock-full of Lena/Julian scenes just for the hell of it??? I guess Julian's purpose of teaching Lena how to let go and move on and love again was totally bullshit. Julian, why the hell were you even introduced as a love interest for Lena in the first place then? Just to make a really shitty, unneeded love triangle? Just to be strung along by Lena the entire time for her to make Alex jealous? Biggest cop-out ever. She had absolutely no respect for Julian's feelings at all. Everything was about ALEX. Here, Lena, have another 'really shitty person' award. My respect I had for you in the second book completely vanished.Let me quote the one of the last pages of Pandemonium:""Promise me we'll stay together, okay? You and me."" - Julian""I promise."" - Lena""Don't believe her."" - AlexYEP, DON'T BELIEVE HER, JULIAN. Also, the start of huge asshole!Alex. Newsflash: You could've tried to give her up and let her go without being a huge asshole. WOAH!!!!!!! Also, this makes no fucking sense in general. Alex wanted to let her go and give her up or some bullshit, so he goes and basically tells someone else who wants to make her happy to back off???? I guess since it can't be him, even though it was HIS decision, it can't be anyone! LOL.And then for the hell of it, to top it all off, let's hurry up end it all with the most anti-climactic, lazy ending ever that leaves everybody feeling bereft and disappointed. Like, open-ended isn't bad if it's done right... yeah, this wasn't. All this felt like was a huge cop-out. We find out NOTHING. Besides making an enormous fucking deal out of the stupid love triangle, this book--the SERIES--was all a huge build-up to this moment... and what? I feel like the end was Gene Wilder yelling at me. There is waaaay too much shit that's left unresolved. OH WELL AT LEAST ALEX AND LENA GET BACK TOGETHER, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY ALL THAT MATTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!I can't even give this two stars. The prose was as beautiful as always, but not even that can save it. My hope that the series could be good after Pandemonium crashed down and I just. I can't. I really don't think a book has ever disappointed me so much. I probably shouldn't have gone in with such high expectations after the greatness that was Pandemonium, but I did.ONE FUCKING STAR.Also, no, bad rating is not from being butthurt about the love triangle not ending in my favor. I wasn't really invested in this series in the first place to really mind either way. I did prefer Julian, but liked Alex as he was in the FIRST BOOK, AKA, a fine fellow and not a huge asshole. Even if I had wanted them to be endgame, this still would've gotten a bad rating from me. Bad rating is from no character development--RECESSION of character development for Lena, Lena being a shitty person in general, shitty empty ending, Alex being shitty, the book's main focus being the stupidly annoying love triangle, and the nonexistent plot being completely unmemorable.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9593913-requiem
Skyward;Brandon Sanderson;2018;2010;513;4.48;146242;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Adventure'];Defeated, crushed, and driven almost to extinction, the remnants of the human race are trapped on a planet that is constantly attacked by mysterious alien starfighters. Spensa, a teenage girl living among them, longs to be a pilot. When she discovers the wreckage of an ancient ship, she realizes this dream might be possible—assuming she can repair the ship, navigate flight school, and (perhaps most importantly) persuade the strange machine to help her. Because this ship, uniquely, appears to have a soul.;"Skyward, the first in a brand-new series by Brandon Sanderson, feels like a prelude. The raw energy of the closing pages rattles; I started every sentence without knowing where it was going, half-terrified of where it might end. When I looked up, the bedlam of motion inside the coffeeshop where I sat was an underwater warble, and I felt the sort of disorientation you only get when you are pulled out of one world and back into another. The effect, of course, of a really good book.**Spensa “Spin” Nightshade was going to be a pilot. As a 7-year-old, she dreamed of it with the raw hope of a child who looked at the stars as if her very soul had unfurled and stretched out to meet it. As a 17-year-old, she knew it with the boundless confidence of a youth who assumed the world will contort itself to accommodate her desires. But Spensa’s name was full of her father’s cowardice in a way nobody could miss. It was a burden and a responsibility. For ten years, Spensa had tried to piece together a father who was gone from rumors that spoke of him deserting his team and betraying his people. But when it is all boiled away, what was always left was that wanting, hard and spare and alive: to prove herself, to clear her father’s name, and to fight for humanity’s survival. Even if that meant breaking the rules, leaving them smashed and glittering in her wake.
“Remember, Spensa. You get to choose who you are. Legacy, memories of the past, can serve us well. But we cannot let them define us. When heritage becomes a box instead of an inspiration, it has gone too far.”
Skyward soared through the autumn and winter of 2018 on a frenzy of love, drawing a cornucopia of rave reviews and dominating bestseller lists. And I have to say—it is well-deserved.Clocking in at more than 500 pages, the novel requires patience as it unfolds in slow but ultimately satisfying layers. The meticulous plotting comes off as the work of someone in absolute charge of his craft. Skyward brims with details that build out into a vast, intricate world which, remarkably, still leaves plenty to explore. It’s a good thing that Sanderson has 4 more books planned for this series as there’s a lot to set up. It’s clear that the author is only getting warmed up; the political and intergalactic machinations that swirled around Spensa had much left to play out. And if Sanderson’s goal was to make his readers clamor for more, I'm pleased to say that he accomplished that goal with flying colors.Skyward is fun, but there’s a deep layer of story at work. Sanderson paints real-world concerns like classism, war profiteering, and patriotic jingoism with piercing resonance. The novel examines, thoughtfully, the dangerous culture of martyrdom that is deeply embedded in the DDF—the Defiant Defense Force—and which had, for many years, been preserved in false perfection.Spensa, who recited Defiance like a litany and ripped herself to rags against the sharp and ugly poetry of it, determined to never be called a coward, is confronted with a truth like ice water: the DDF bleeds great gouts of young pilots in the deadly battles against the Krell, but spares the sons and daughters of the elite who are pulled out from the Academy by their wealthy and well-connected parents when the peril becomes too real. Spensa had thought she could join the DDF and vie for the only chance she would ever have at glory, she built her life around that dream, but Spensa soon discovers that her government’s talk of glory and heroism, all their promises, wear a thinner veil than a funeral shroud. Spensa didn’t want to be a part of this machine anymore. But the machine didn’t care. The machine went on grinding and catching her up in its gears.Spensa’s character development doesn’t stop there. All her life the mystery of what had really happened the day her father was unequivocally branded a coward hung over her, and she had hardly dared hope that she might get the answers she longed for. When Spensa does, the truth of it strikes her backhanded, and her heart—for the second time—splits in two and goes to war against itself. The truth, this novel explores as brilliantly as anything else, is never how we want it: clear-cut and shining, a perfect moral center leading us all back home.
“Sometimes, the answers we need don’t match the questions we’re asking.” He looked up at me. “And sometimes, the coward makes fools of wiser men.”
This is, I think, what I relished most about this book: the way the author gives his characters plenty of room to fumble and triumph. He made a list of characters that kept getting longer (then, heartbreakingly, shorter) and injected them with enough interiority to keep his readers riveted. Spensa’s journey, in particular, is wonderful to watch, and her potential narrative paths for the sequel are very intriguing. I, for one, can’t wait to see where Sanderson takes her.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36642458-skyward
The Infinite Sea;Rick Yancey;2014;2010;320;3.84;143576;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Aliens', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Romance'];How do you rid the Earth of seven billion humans? Rid the humans of their humanity.Surviving the first four waves was nearly impossible. Now Cassie Sullivan finds herself in a new world, a world in which the fundamental trust that binds us together is gone. As the 5th Wave rolls across the landscape, Cassie, Ben, and Ringer are forced to confront the Others’ ultimate goal: the extermination of the human race.Cassie and her friends haven’t seen the depths to which the Others will sink, nor have the Others seen the heights to which humanity will rise, in the ultimate battle between life and death, hope and despair, love and hate.;"I really LOVED The 5th Wave. I read it in the middle of my college exams and it was the only thing that kept me sane in between studying. The atmosphere was just right, the writing was engaging to me, and I thought each of the characters brought something important to the table. Such love is hard to follow.When I opened this book I was both excited and nervous. My expectations were so high that I knew it was dangerous. And, what can I say? I really needn't have worried. There is something so utterly compelling about Yancey's writing that makes me think we would be great friends in real life. This book has more flaws and not quite as much eerie atmosphere now the big secrets are out... but, overall, it is a worthy sequel that didn't fail to punch me in the gut numerous times. If you were a little worried that Yancey wouldn't be able to pull out another good 'un after The 5th Wave - don't be.

“The world will burn for a hundred years. Fire will consume the things we made from wood and plastic and rubber and cloth, then water and wind and time will chew the stone and steel into dust. How baffling it is that we imagined cities incinerated by alien bombs and death rays when all they needed was Mother Nature and time.”

I think the first book is a quieter novel, which had different effects on different readers. I, personally, thought it was one of the book's strengths. The Infinite Sea, however, is a different kind of book. We finished the first after a huge climax of action and drama; the secrets were out, covers had been blown, we were suddenly dropped into the middle of a war that only escalated with this second book. Here things go from bad to worse; people are lost, distrust lingers between the characters, these kids have had to grow up faster than kids ever should.To get the negative out of the way...The most annoying thing about this book is Cassie. I am relieved that Yancey chose to write in a style that moves from perspective to perspective effectively because she might have driven me crazy otherwise. Yancey's characters are so different and have so many layers that I don't believe for a second that the author was chanelling his own beliefs through Cassie, but that didn't stop me from hating her slut-shaming and self-righteousness. Her love for Evan is a little more nauseating in this sequel than in the first, but I am glad that this whole situation introduces us to a minor but fascinating character called Grace. This is her from Cassie's perspective:

“a tall girl with a cascade of honey-blond hair and striking Norwegian-model-type features, piercing blue eyes, full, pouty, collagen-packed lips, and the willowy figure of a runway fashion princess.“Hello, Evan,” Cosmo Girl said. And of course her voice was deep and slightly scratchy like every seductive villainess ever conceived by Hollywood.”

*eye roll* and then later...

“Why don’t you tell me,” I shot back. “You extraterrestrial slut.”

Allow me to point out that she is a ""slut"" because she used to be with Evan before Cassie came along. Cassie and Evan are like the Mary Sue and Gary Stu at the centre of this book who angst over each other with emo poetry. If these things bug you too you might be wondering how this book still manages to pull out a load of awesome and get a high rating...Because - and I should probably stress this - Cassie and Evan are only a very small part of The Infinite Sea. This book is full of different characters and interesting little back stories that it's easy to just ignore those two. As I said, we get to meet Grace who I found fascinating. We hear the back story between her and Evan so she becomes something more interesting and well-rounded than merely Evan's ex who is being used as a tool to make Cassie jealous. And we learn Poundcake's disturbing history and find out just why he never speaks.But my favourite character? Ringer. She was rapidly becoming my favourite in the first book and this one just cemented my love for her. I love everything about her. From the rage that bubbles beneath the surface:

“My anger is greater than the sum of all lost things.”

To her flirtations with Zombie, her intriguing back story and the way she tells Cassie exactly how it is:

""Beats hanging around here waiting for your alien prince to come.""

In the end, this was a really good sequel with plenty of action, drama, twists and turns. I didn't reread the first book before I started and that didn't affect my enjoyment; I got sucked back into the world and story instantly. I feel like I'm just completely on the same wavelength as Rick Yancey because his writing always just works for me; he can be writing about action or characters or philosophical musings... and I genuinely enjoy reading it. Can't wait for the next book.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16131484-the-infinite-sea

One of six still alive.And I'm ready to fight.;"There are probably spoilers: Jess: Hello there, James Frey, aka Pittacus Lore. Welcome to the show.James Frey: Thanks for having me. How much money did we agree I'd be getting for this interview? Jess: A lot. James Frey: Good, because I adore money. Jess: I can tell. In the past nine months you've released two New York Times Best Selling novels, one e-book/novella, and had a large budget film adaption. You must be stoked. You and Mr. Hughes are rolling in moneyJames Frey:Yes, we are. Jess: Lets introduce your newest novel: The Power of Six, sequel to I Am Number Four. I just finished reading it yesterday afternoon... James Frey: What did you think? Jess:It's shit. Total and utter shit. Clearly you wrote this quickly, like, no more than a few weeks. It's very obvious: this is some of the most poorly written drivel I have ever read-and I've read Twilight James Frey:How dare you! Give me three good examples. Jess: The dialogue is the most awkward thing ever. There are hardly any descriptions. You did a crap job at building suspense and foreshadowing. At some stages you threw in lengthy words that didnt fit, just to show us how smart you are. The writing lacks any emotion; it could have been written by a robot. I could go on; and will, when I talk with my next guest. James Frey: But its an exciting plot, yes? I mean, a thrilling read. Jess:the writing was too distracting, but I suppose the plot is the only thing this book has going for it. I suppose thats why its got so many good reviews. James Frey: ...And why I get so much MONEY! Jess: Money, thats all you're about, isnt it? Rushing the release of this book, a movie adaption, a novella. I swear, you've just published your first draft. Like I said, no foreshadowing or anything. Oh yeah, and you know the most annoying thing? When you decided to introduce Ella as Number Ten. You cant do that! Bitch, thats cheating!. Everyone knows there are nine Garde, then all of a sudden BAM! Number Ten! No pre-warning, no solid explanation. James Frey: That's a good twist. Jess: No, a good twist is Snape being a good guy. A good twist is Christopher discovering his mother is alive. These things had foreshadowing: it didnt stick out at the time, but we noticed them later. Having a 'Number Ten' is not a fucking twist, its cheating, and for that I hate you. James Frey: Whatever gurl, The Chicago Tribune said: 'There's genuine suspense'. Jess: No. Your shit writing made any suspense thinner than Nicole Richie. For example, when Marina heard that Miranda Marquez, a girl who she looks exactly alike, was found strangled. This was supposed to make us scared of Mogodorians coming. Trying to build suspense. Yeah, it might have worked if you had said they looked alike before the line after her death. There are many more examples, but quite frankly, I hate talking to you. James Frey: Cool, that interview will cost you $2,500,000. Now Im going home to start and finish the next book in the series before bed time. Jess:*sigh*. Well, Im not going to be a sucker and give you any more of my money. Im not buying any more Lorien Legacies books. Had I been American, I would'nt have even brought this one. The US cover is the fugliest thing I have ever seen! We'll be back after this short ad break with John Smith himself. Stay tuned!  Jess: Hello, welcome back to the show. Now I have with me the star of the show, John Smith, also known as Number Four! John Smith: Hey there Jess: Im not going to lie, I kind of had the hots for you in book one. You were awesome in every way. Now you suck. John Smith: Sorry? Jess: I hate you. Mainly your decision making. I mean, did you honestly think it was a good idea to catch up with Sarah? You couldnt see that ending badly at all-heavy sarcasm.John Smith: Thats one poor decision. Jess: Or dragging Sam Goode along on your adventure. That boy is the biggest waste of space I have ever read about-more later. Or how about that time you ran straight into the blue Mogodorian forcefield, knowing full well it would knock you out and made you feel sick. That totally reminded me of the time Patrick Dangerfield concussed himself by running straight into the goal post against the Western Bulldogs. Oh, and another terrible decision was when you and Six saved that innocent woman from her drunken husband, with the whole 'no innocent people should be hurt' vibe going on. Then you throw the Mogodorian tracking devise on the back of an innocent mans truck and laugh about it. Contradicting much? John Smith: I wasnt thinking clearly... Jess:Oh, and at one stage you say: ""I feel sad"". Really, thats the best you could come up with? John Smith: I tell it as it is.Jess: Anywho, lets get to the juicy stuff that all our viewers want to know. How does it feel being the FBI's Most Wanted? John Smith: Pretty coolJess: Lets get the story straight. A small school, in a tiny town, in Ohio is found wrecked in the morning. There is ash everywhere and entire buildings are ruined. What does this sound like, to normal human beings?John Smith: A fire? Jess:Yes, so why does everyone instantly presume its a terrorist attack. What sort of badass terrorists target a high school in a tiny town which 99% of people wouldn't have heard of? John Smith: Are you saying my life in the past few weeks is...Im on the run for nothing?Jess: Im saying you're on the run for the most stupid reason! No sane human being instantly concludes what would look like a fire is a terrorist attack! The school down the road from me burnt down last year, true story. All that was left was rubble and ash. Does this mean that police should instantly assume crazy terrorists are at work in Adelaide.John Smith: I... Jess: No, let me continue: Then when they finally do catch you, Top of the FBI's Most Wanted List (for attacking a school), they put you in a cell which has bars, not a solid wall, and guarded by one, single guard. Then the guard immerses you in conversation. John Smith: I started talking to him, actually. Jess: And he responded, conversation! When they had Osama Bin Laden, I dont think he was guarded by a single security officer, who responded to Osama's conversation starters. That whole episode was so unrealistic! John Smith: Its a work of fiction, its allowed to be unrealisticJess: Actually no, JK Rowling made her world of magic seem real. Its possible to make fiction realistic. Also, on a totally unrelated note, what the fuck is up with your love triangle? Audience: Jess has only said that word once on goodreads.com before, she must be mad! Jess Love triangles are so unnecessary. Why does every YA novel need to have them. Plus, yours with Sarah & Six was forced. There was no need for it, and you shared no chemistry with either. It was literally: ""I like Six, but I have to love Sarah. Therefore, my life is to hard and I should go complain and bore everyone with my forced romance."" John, and James Frey if you're listening, you are PATHETIC! Get a proper sub-plot and dont come back until you do. Jess: Now that my interview with John Smith is over, please welcome Unnamed Evil Mogodorian Alien #56 Unnamed Evil Mogodorian Alien #56: Hello. Jess: Thanks for coming, and thanks for not killing me. Firstly, I love your matrix style trench coat.Unnamed Evil Mogodorian Alien #56: Cheers. Jess: Secondly, whats the deal dude? Why are you lot the worst antagonists of all time?Unnamed Evil Mogodorian Alien #56: Thats a bit harsh.Jess: Its true. There were thousands of you, and you cant kill two Lorics and a human boy. maybe the Lorics are acceptable, but Sam!? he researched his fighting from the internet in the first chapters. You're badass aliens, why cant you kill him? Unnamed Evil Mogodorian Alien #56: No comment. Jess:Also, why did you strangle Miranda Marquez, the chick who looks like Number 7? Are turning peeps to ash with mega guns and shit not cool any more? Unnamed Evil Mogodorian Alien #56: No comment. Jess: Seriously dude, early on when you lit fire to the house Sam was in, I was so happy. I was ready to convert to your side, I seriously thought you'd just killed Sam, but then he slipped through your fingers. Now that you've got him captive, please torture the shit out of him.Unnamed Evil Mogodorian Alien #56: Hopefully, but James Frey is terrible at creating us, hes in charge of our actions. That means Sam will probably escape our evil alien base of evilness. Jess: Im feeling for ya. Hey, Ive got Sam from his cage via skype next, but he is a bigger waste of space than the extra three 'Mortal Instruments' books, and I really dont want to talk to that guy.Unnamed Evil Mogodorian Alien #56: Why so?Jess: He's just dumb. I mean, when he and John had an hour of invisibility to sneak into your base, he set his alarm watch for 60 minutes, so it went off as soon as he was visible again. Why not set it for fifty minutes, so when it vibrates they know to get out of there quickly! Also, when he needed to go back to Paradise to check the sun dial, he forced Six and Four to go back with him. This resulted in them getting caught. Why on earth would he have not just called Sarah's mobile, and ask her to check out the necessary stuff. She could have told him her findings, and they're all safe!Unnamed Evil Mogodorian Alien #56: I'm hearing you! I dont associate with such fools either.Jess:Thank you! Say, want to catch up for a coffee after the show?Unnamed Evil Mogodorian Alien #56: Sure. And I'll show you where I get my trench coats! Jess:Cool beans! Lets go right now. I'm sure I'll look swanky in one of those trench coatsUnnamed Evil Mogodorian Alien #56: You'll look spiffy as hell. Jess:Outstanding. Well, thats the show for tonight, thanks for your company. I'm Jessica, and I'll see you next week! And cut. First Review: January 7,2011The description of this book says its about 'Number 7'. I DONT WANT NUMBER 7! I WANT NUMBER 4! I want to read about John Smith, and his friend Sam and his kick-but side kick, Number 6! If #7 hogs this book, I will be really upset! And Sarah Hart had better make an appearance somewhere, or I will be devastated! But anyway, I am super-amazingly-incredibly excited about this one. It had better be nothing short of sensational :)  I AM LIVING FOR THIS BOOK!!!! Second Review: March 22,2011So, I definitely can not wait until mid August for this! I want it now!!!! *. So, in early preparation, I thought some speculation would be in order: Even though the blurb talks about 'Number Seven', I still think the title refers to the character 'Number Six', and will reveal some sort of freakish/awesome power that she posses. She will be the focus of this, and #4 & #7 will be supporting characters. The reasons for this are: 1) we just met Number Six at the end of the previous book. Its to early to introduce a new main character, knowing nothing about Six. We need to learn something and let her develop. 2) I heard there will be six books. If this is true, the second book seems way to early to re-unite the entire gang. I strongly believe this book will be about John Smith, Number Six and Sam Goode trying to locate #7 (after somehow hearing about him/her). In the midst of their search, there will be a mega-giant twist about Number Six, and someone will do something bad to inflict trouble on the group. But yes, I am very excited.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8659601-the-power-of-six
Pines;Blake Crouch;2012;2010;307;3.94;137965;yes;['Thriller', 'Science Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Audiobook'];Wayward Pines, Idaho, is quintessential small-town America--or so it seems. Secret Service agent Ethan Burke arrives in search of two missing federal agents, yet soon is facing much more than he bargained for. After a violent accident lands him in the hospital, Ethan comes to with no ID and no cell phone. The medical staff seems friendly enough, but sometimes feels...off. As days pass, Ethan's investigation into his colleagues' disappearance turns up more questions than answersWHY CAN'T HE MAKE CONTACT WITH HIS FAMILY IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD? WHY DOESN'T ANYONE BELIEVE HE IS WHO HE SAYS HE IS? AND WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE ELECTRIFIED FENCES ENCIRCLING THE TOWN? ARE THEY KEEPING THE RESIDENTS IN? OR SOMETHING ELSE OUT?Each step toward the truth takes Ethan further from the world he knows, until he must face a horrifying fact—he may never get out of Wayward Pines alive.....;"And the base emotion underlying it all that was getting harder and harder to ignore.Terror.The strengthening sense that something was very, very wrong.
As with The Magicians, I have to confess I like the TV series Wayward Pines far better than the book. Yes, I know the ""reveal"" has been spoiled, but that really wasn't my problem with it. Pines is built on a fantastic idea - no, really, a truly epic idea - and that strength just about manages to carry the book despite some poor writing, an asshole protagonist, and an exceptional lack of diversity that, given the situation, has even more troubling implications than usual.Coming into this book after watching the show definitely affects how you view it. It's impossible not to notice how every woman becomes hot or ""cute"". And the pearly-whiteness of the cast of characters practically glows from the pages. Perhaps I wouldn't have picked up on it if I hadn't already seen a diverse cast in the show, but it was like coming to a lesser, whitewashed version of the story I've come to love.The plot is really very compelling. Special Agent Ethan Burke is involved in an accident on his way into Wayward Pines, Idaho - a place where two missing agents were last supposed to be. He awakes in a hospital without his personal belongings and with no way to contact his boss or family. Right away, something feels wrong. Everyone is friendly but they all seem reluctant to help him make contact with anyone outside the town. It's engaging because Ethan's situation is genuinely frightening. The need to know what the hell is going on keeps the pages turning or the episodes playing; even reading the book knowing the truth, there was a knot in the pit of stomach as I imagined being in Ethan's situation. It's weird, it's creepy, it's a lot of mind-boggling fun.But the TV show is better. The book is written in a very simplistic way, which may not seem like a terrible thing, but it is noticeably juvenile - I'm not usually someone to notice the writing unless it is very good or very bad, and this one I picked up on right away.As well as the writing issues and the whiteness, Ethan Burke is far less likable in Pines. Maybe if he'd been more developed and complex, instead of just mindlessly arrogant and annoying, I would have liked him despite his flaws. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.So I will say that this story is great and you should experience it. However, I think the best way to experience it is on your TV screen. And that's not something I usually say.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15096164-pines
Abaddon’s Gate;James S.A. Corey;2013;2010;539;4.27;135901;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy'];Abaddon's Gate is the third book in the New York Times bestselling Expanse series. For generations, the solar system - Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt - was humanity's great frontier. Until now. The alien artefact working through its program under the clouds of Venus has emerged to build a massive structure outside the orbit of Uranus: a gate that leads into a starless dark.Jim Holden and the crew of the Rocinante are part of a vast flotilla of scientific and military ships going out to examine the artefact. But behind the scenes, a complex plot is unfolding, with the destruction of Holden at its core. As the emissaries of the human race try to find whether the gate is an opportunity or a threat, the greatest danger is the one they brought with them.;"2.5/5 starsThis was underwhelming; my least favorite novel in the series so far.Please tell me I’m not the only one who thought this was subpar. Abaddon’s Gate, the third book in The Expanse series by James S.A. Corey duo, was honestly a struggle for me to finish. The story begins almost a year since the end of Caliban’s War, and although it started interesting and wholesome, I overall have mixed feelings about it. I do think that Abaddon’s Gate is the weakest installment out of three books I’ve read in the series so far. Holden and the crew of Rocinante were entertaining, and reading their gradual development remain as one of the main strengths of the book, but they didn’t have enough spotlight here. Plus, for almost the entirety of the book, the setting of Abaddon’s Gate takes place inside a spaceship; it didn’t have that intergalactic scale feeling that the previous two books have. To be honest, this book felt like filler. There’s one gigantic conflict that needed to be solved as quickly as possible, but instead, the characters just spent the entirety of the book bickering with each other, talking about religion and preaching their respective moral code.

“Violence is what people do when they run out of good ideas. It's attractive because it's simple, it's direct, it's almost always available as an option. When you can't think of a good rebuttal for your opponent's argument, you can always punch them in the face.” 

The final action sequences felt almost as if Corey didn’t know what to do anymore and just decided to have the characters shooting at each other for so many pages—at least that’s how it felt to me—until the book is finished. When it comes down to it, I think my biggest issue with this book can be narrowed down to the fact that I couldn’t find myself invested with any of the new main characters. Although the new perspective characters did make the standalone and formulaic style story fresh in terms of narrative, it’s too risky to do because each new installment requires us to know three new main characters over and over again. The characters in Caliban’s War was incredibly compelling, and they’re too good to not have an immediate follow-up; not even small appearances. Anna, Melba, and Bull, in my opinion, were so uninteresting and forgettable; they pale in comparison to Miller, Avasarala, and Bobby that made the previous books shine. Due to my detachment with the characters, Melba’s story of revenge became boring, and Anna’s self-righteous virtue of “don’t do this don’t do that, but I won’t do anything except preach” ended up annoying me so much.

“Show a human a closed door, and no matter how many open doors she finds, she'll be haunted by what might be behind it.” 

I haven’t watched the TV series past season 2, but my instinct voiced that I would prefer Abaddon’s Gate on the screen than on the text. Abaddon’s Gate was sadly underwhelming to me, but same with all long-series that spans more than five volumes, there’s bound to be one or two that missed the mark, and I still look forward to reading Cibola Burn in a few weeks.

“If humanity were capable of being satisfied, then they'll still be living in trees and eating bugs out of one another's fur.”

Children of Time;Adrian Tchaikovsky;2015;2010;608;4.3;135387;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];A race for survival among the stars... Humanity's last survivors escaped earth's ruins to find a new home. But when they find it, can their desperation overcome its dangers?WHO WILL INHERIT THIS NEW EARTH?The last remnants of the human race left a dying Earth, desperate to find a new home among the stars. Following in the footsteps of their ancestors, they discover the greatest treasure of the past age—a world terraformed and prepared for human life.But all is not right in this new Eden. In the long years since the planet was abandoned, the work of its architects has borne disastrous fruit. The planet is not waiting for them, pristine and unoccupied. New masters have turned it from a refuge into mankind's worst nightmare.Now two civilizations are on a collision course, both testing the boundaries of what they will do to survive. As the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, who are the true heirs of this new Earth?;There's something wildly giddy welling up within me, and I blame it entirely on this book.There have been a couple of brilliant SF titles to come out this year and I would swear belong on the Hugo list, and this is yet one more. Kim Stanley Robinson's Aurora was one, as was Scott Hawkins's The Library at Mount Char, but if I had to break down the individual merits of each, I might wind up saying that this one deserves it the most. For pure SF, it hits the heights of ideas, memorable characters, exploration, and message, although the message is definitely not one that is apparent until the end.It has all the hallmarks of a good classic SF tale, and I was reminded every step of the way of John Brunner's The Crucible of Time, with the bringing up of an alien society from its primitive roots to space exploration, the wild quest of humanity trying to survive it's own stupidity in over ten thousand years of desperate Ark travel, and throw into the mix a great mad cyborg/AI god/scientist who's belief system gets sorely challenged. If all that isn't enough to perk you up, then how about a society of biopunk spiders learning to tame themselves and their world with the propelling help of a nanovirus designed to uplift an entirely different species, but lacking those poor monkeys, had to make due with some jumping spiders from old Earth?Oh yeah. Now we're talking. From page one we get a precious nod to David Brin for his wonderful Uplift series, but right as we begin to suspect that it's a rip-off, everything goes to hell. I call that an auspicious beginning.And then we get slices of alien life complete with great self-contained stories, with nothing worthless to the grand over-tale being spun, including the war and eventual domestication of deadly intelligent army ants, the fight for the poor male spider's rights (who don't appreciate being eaten after mating), and the eventual discovery that the original scientist that had seeded the world with the nanovirus, who still lived as a cyborg, was not, in fact, a god.And if that isn't enough, let's get to know the human side of the equation. They've had a rough time climbing back out of a dark age only to discover that the Earth is a complete shit hole and there's nothing left to be saved. They rose on the backs of the dead society that had brought humanity to this pass and went out to search for a new home. Unfortunately, everything has gone to shit except this one little paradise that's defended by a mad cyborg god who thinks that humans are shit. (And she's right.) She'll protect her precious project from anything that dares disturb it.Great conflict ensues. My god this was a great book. I had a bit of a learning curve in the first few dozen pages getting over the somewhat sparse writing, but there's a purpose to it. A hell of a lot has to happen to build such an enormous tale without stretching it out into a dozen equivalent and impoverished books. In this one novel, we get everything. It's brilliant.I'll revisit this review at a later time and see if it still captures my imagination as much as the other Hugo Possibles, but my mind wants to put all my bets on this one. The flaws in Aurora, despite the brilliant setup, message, and end, are just enough to push it down a rung for me. Library at Mount Char was mostly dark fantasy with a damn huge nod at turning it into a real SF title, and I still think it's awesome and mythic, but if I had to choose between something that's obviously SF to the core and beyond and a great book that has more in common with American Gods and Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, (both of which won Hugos in their years despite being fantasies), then I'd choose Children of Time.Unfortunately, I'm going to have to sit on the fence. Having to choose between two novels that are very different in scope, writing, and characterizations is a hell of a thing. Both are fantastic at what they do. I cried during both. I'll just have to revisit my memories later to be certain.Oh, there is one more thing I need to mention.I hate the title. It does absolutely NOTHING to enumerate how fucking awesome this epic SF is. Fans of any classic SF need to read this gem. It has a hell of a lot more flow to it, and just as much idea exploration as anything written by Alastair Reynolds. Go get it.

The Humans;Matt Haig;2013;2010;285;4.08;133374;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary', 'Adult'];When an extraterrestrial visitor arrives on Earth, his first impressions of the human species are less than positive. Taking the form of Professor Andrew Martin, a leading mathematician at Cambridge University, the visitor wants to complete his task and return home to his planet and a utopian society of immortality and infinite knowledge.He is disgusted by the way humans look, what they eat, and the wars they witness on the news, and is totally baffled by concepts such as love and family. But as time goes on, he starts to realize there may be more to this weird species than he has been led to believe. He drinks wine, reads Emily Dickinson, listens to Talking Heads, and begins to bond with the family he lives with, in disguise. In picking up the pieces of the professor's shattered personal life, the narrator sees hope and redemption in the humans' imperfections and begins to question the very mission that brought him there--a mission that involves not only thwarting human progress...but murder.;"In August 2012 my brother died by suicide. In the dark days and weeks immediately after his death I read almost incessantly. I couldn't sleep because when I closed my eyes all I could see was his body (I had to go to the mortuary with my father to formally identify his body.) When I was awake I read so I could bear the raw grief ripping at my heart. I believe that it's thanks to books I survived those days, I'm not sure how I'd have coped without books giving me a respite from my at times overwhelming reality.The Humans wasn't published then but I wish it had been. It tells the story of an alien sent from the planet Vonnadoria to remove all evidence of the solving of the Riemann hypothesis (the key to prime numbers which guarantee a huge technological leap for mankind) by eminent Cambridge professor Andrew Martin. The Vonnadorians are horrified by this breakthrough as they see humans as a primitive, violent race not ready for the advancements the solving of the hypothesis will bring. An unnamed alien is therefore sent to Earth on a mission to ensure humankind remains unaware that this secret has been solved. He kills Martin then inhabits his body in order to infiltrate his life and erase all traces of his discovery, by removing all technological evidence and by killing anybody he may have told.The first part of the book has several comic moments, the alien arrives knowing nothing of human life and finds himself naked and without language on a motorway. Matt Haig has held a magnifying glass to humans here and through the eyes of the alien Andrew we see our often irrational absurdity.As the book progresses it becomes more poignant, Martin learns more about what it means to be human, thanks partly to a dog, peanut butter and Emily Dickinson. The 97 point list that features in the book is perhaps the book's shining moment, Matt's skillful blending of the emotional with the humorous means he avoids this list becoming saccharine and it is genuinely moving, my favourite point being ""It's not the length of life that matters. It's the depth. But while burrowing, keep the sun above you.""The Humans is a beautifully written insight into what it means to be a human and how pain, sorrow and fear are a necessary part of that. With my grief not being a linear process there are days when I am hit again with an almost unbearable sadness. I know that on those days I will turn once more to The Humans. I don't ever feel suicidal but there are times when I question what it means to live. When I read The Humans I am given an answer.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130537-the-humans
Death's End;Liu Cixin;2010;2010;604;4.42;130051;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'China', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Space'];With The Three-Body Problem, English-speaking readers got their first chance to experience the multiple-award-winning and bestselling Three-Body Trilogy by China's most beloved science fiction author, Cixin Liu. Three-Body was released to great acclaim including coverage in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. It was also named a finalist for the Nebula Award, making it the first translated novel to be nominated for a major SF award since Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities in 1976.Now this epic trilogy concludes with Death's End. Half a century after the Doomsday Battle, the uneasy balance of Dark Forest Deterrence keeps the Trisolaran invaders at bay. Earth enjoys unprecedented prosperity due to the infusion of Trisolaran knowledge. With human science advancing daily and the Trisolarans adopting Earth culture, it seems that the two civilizations will soon be able to co-exist peacefully as equals without the terrible threat of mutually assured annihilation. But the peace has also made humanity complacent.Cheng Xin, an aerospace engineer from the early 21st century, awakens from hibernation in this new age. She brings with her knowledge of a long-forgotten program dating from the beginning of the Trisolar Crisis, and her very presence may upset the delicate balance between two worlds. Will humanity reach for the stars or die in its cradle?;"Re-read 3/30/24:So. After re-reading the series, getting to this one... I *KNEW* it was going to destroy me. I *KNEW* it.I should just mention here that some SF just goes above and beyond. Some goes WAY above and beyond. And then some just blow the fucking roof off the membrane of the universe and totally destroys us.So, yeah, this one is of the latter kind.I personally get a ton of satisfaction out of the fact that Liu Cixin manages to weave utter lows and ultimate hope together in a Hard-SF, real physics way. I understand the science and it just keeps -- destroying me. After Dark Forest, it was dark enough, but this just kept tying the rope around me to drag me through the mud again and again. This one has ALL the scope, all the mud-dragging, all tragedies piled on tragedies.And yet, it was also, at the end, a hopeful book.I am in awe. Again.Original Review:This is one of those rare mind-blowing novels of such fantastic scope and direction that words just can't do it justice. It's the third book that started with the Hugo-Winning The Three-Body Problem, continued with The Dark Forest. They're all fantastic, but I have to honestly say that I loved this one more than the rest.We've got the scope of some of Stephen Baxter's Xeelee Sequence* going on here. I'm talking universe-spanning scope, going straight through time like a hot knife through butter and right on out into the expanding reaches of the imagination. The first book dives into the tiniest particles and higher dimensional spaces, the second deals with the apparent macro universe and the ongoing conflict between the Tri-Solarans and Humanity, and the third concludes with some truly and amazingly harrowing experiences, from the end of the stalemate, the near-genocide of humanity, and the grand realization that it's all gone even more wrong.And things only get worse from there.I'm properly flabbergasted by this book. There are enough fantastic ideas crammed in here for ten books, maybe even twenty. And even if it wasn't so idea-rich, from the extrapolated sciences, extremely well-thought-out consequences, and even further extrapolations from there, we even get some of the more interesting characters ever written in SF.My appreciation of The Dark Forest only increases when set beside this one, and although I didn't consider that novel quite worthy of the Hugo as the first novel was, it was an amazing set-up for this last novel's execution. The Dark Forest is an expression of the idea that the universe is an extremely hostile place. Any two alien species that meets is likely going to preemptively wipe out the other or face the reality of being wiped out. Such conflicts at such huge scales and high-technology and physics can be utterly amazing and one-sided, from start explosions to local space conversions between dimensions, such as turning a local three-dimensional plane of existence into a two-dimensional one.Utterly shocking. Utterly amazing.We even get to visit, early on, the tombstones of entire alien civilizations that escaped the Dark Forest by hopping into the fourth dimensional frame from the third dimension, only to discover that the great time-stream is shrinking, a bunch of big fish already having consumed all the small fish, and now the pond of existence is shrinking to almost nothing.Each new discovery or option or hope is explored and dashed. The conflict, the Sword of Damocles, never leaves the tale. The Dark Forest is always evident, and it's depressing and awe-inspiring and a great story and I was honestly in awe of all the new directions it took.I've read a LOT of SF. I've never seen anyone pull this off quite as well as this.He builds on every new idea and makes a universe as frightening as it is amazing, and nothing ever stays the same.And best of all, he leaves humanity as it is. Hopelessly outmatched. Always hopelessly outmatched. No matter what we do, how we advance and improve or build upon inherited technologies from our one-time friends, dark gods, and demons, the Tri-Solarans, there's always a new snag.*shiver*Honestly, there's no way to review this except to tell everyone out there that there's just too many great things to say about it, that it is a monumental undertaking, that it is an endlessly fascinating and impressive corpus of work, and that everyone should avail themselves of this trilogy.It's just that good. I'm in awe.Some things are just heads and shoulders above the rest. Well, perhaps, this one is a whole storey above all the rest, too. :)*Correction ;)";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25451264-death-s-end
Rogue Protocol;Martha Wells;2018;2010;160;4.25;124305;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Novella', 'Adult', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];SciFi’s favorite antisocial A.I. is again on a mission. The case against the too-big-to-fail GrayCris Corporation is floundering, and more importantly, authorities are beginning to ask more questions about where Dr. Mensah’s SecUnit is.And Murderbot would rather those questions went away. For good.;I’m going to stop reviewing these books because I’m not going to lie: this entire volume could be about Murderbot laughing at a cat video and I would enjoy it. I love the questions this series brings up of what makes a human, and I’m increasingly feeling like the answers are coming and coming fast. I love the fast-paced plot, I love the sweet human side characters, I love the tidbits of wordbuilding we get here [i know I never say this but I want more!!] and I adore the humor. Reading about an AI making fun of how annoying humans are with comments like “not that I’m bitter or anything” [no, I’m not kidding] is really just the epitome of fun and I would like to continue doing it until the day I die. I also reviewed book one and book two.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35519101-rogue-protocol
Armada;Ernest Cline;2015;2010;355;3.55;122208;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure'];Zack Lightman has spent his life dreaming. Dreaming that the real world could be a little more like the countless science-fiction books, movies, and videogames he’s spent his life consuming. Dreaming that one day, some fantastic, world-altering event will shatter the monotony of his humdrum existence and whisk him off on some grand space-faring adventure. But hey, there’s nothing wrong with a little escapism, right? After all, Zack tells himself, he knows the difference between fantasy and reality. He knows that here in the real world, aimless teenage gamers with anger issues don’t get chosen to save the universe. And then he sees the flying saucer. Even stranger, the alien ship he’s staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a hugely popular online flight simulator called Armada—in which gamers just happen to be protecting the earth from alien invaders.  No, Zack hasn’t lost his mind. As impossible as it seems, what he’s seeing is all too real. And his skills—as well as those of millions of gamers across the world—are going to be needed to save the earth from what’s about to befall it. It’s Zack’s chance, at last, to play the hero. But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can’t help thinking back to all those science-fiction stories he grew up with, and wondering: Doesn’t something about this scenario seem a little…familiar? At once gleefully embracing and brilliantly subverting science-fiction conventions as only Ernest Cline could, Armada is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a classic coming of age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you’ve ever read before—one whose every page is infused with the pop-culture savvy that has helped make Ready Player One a phenomenon.;- The Last Starfighter- Ender’s Game-“Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny, the last Battlestar, Galactica, leads a ragtag, fugitive fleet on a lonely quest for a shining planet known as Earth.- Proton packs- Twiki from Buck Rogers- “I’d buy that for a dollar!”- Ms Pac-Man- Mix tapes- “Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.”- Pitfall- “Theorizing that one could time travel within his own lifetime, Dr. Sam Beckett stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator - and vanished.”- Tron- “Where we’re going, we don’t need roads!”- Defender- Warp core breaches- “Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?”- Voight-Kampff test- Streets of Fire- “Yippie-ki-yay, motherf...….”Why did you stop me? What’s that you say? You can’t just string a bunch of nerdy ‘80s pop culture references together and call it a coherent piece of writing? Maybe not, but Ernest Cline is getting rich doing it so I thought I’d give it a try. Ah, but seriously folks...Zach Lightman is a high school kid whose only real talent is playing video games. His father was killed in an accident right after he was born, and thanks to an attic full of the old man’s stuff Zach is well versed in ‘80s movies, TV, and music. There’s also a notebook in which his dad theorized that all the pop culture since the '70s was done as part of a plan to prepare the world for a coming alien invasion, and video games were introduced to train the public on how they’d fight them. Zach learns that his father’s theory was right when he gets scooped up by the Earth Defense Alliance because his skills are needed to help fight off the space invaders. Cline has lifted elements from stories like The Last Starfighter and Ender’s Game, and then used the notion that the EDA has been influencing Earth’s culture for decades to create a loop in which he can continually roll out nerdy references to the point where you’ll want to punch the next person who says anything about Star Wars within your hearing. Oh, and Futurama also did this plot in a much better and funnier way about 7 years earlier. Borrowing story from other works isn’t the worst thing about this though. The part Cline lifted is used fairly often in entertainment as general wish fulfillment that any kid might be exceptional somehow. So this doesn’t come across as quite the act of plagiarism it sounds like from the premise of the book. That’s far from the biggest problem with Armada.The important thing here is that Ernest Cline is a goddamn hack.I thought his first book Ready Player One was lightweight mildly entertaining sci-fi that mainly coasted by due to its appeal as Gen-X nostalgia porn, but Cline is like that guy at work who made one decent joke that got a short giggle out of you once in the break room and after that repeats a variation of it every time you bump into him in the hall. With this second book he’s shown that he has no other moves than playing the pop culture card because Armada is nothing but the same gag repeated ad nauseam. My irritation starts with Zach Lightman because just as in RP1 we once again have a teenage hero who is obsessed with the ‘80s despite not living in them. Yeah, Cline makes up some reasons as to why a kid in the future or in the present would get into this, but in reality this is just an excuse for a middle-aged man to put his own youth culture into the mouths of younger characters in an attempt to convince us all that the ‘80s were totally awesome and completely relevant today, dude!It also gives him the opportunity to unleash his never ending stream of nerdy references in lieu of actually writing a book. The main character can’t describe anything, anyone, or any emotional state without using pop culture as shorthand. Almost everything that happens to him has to be expressed by comparing it to a movie, TV show, or video game. He literally can’t describe his own mother without evoking Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley to give you an idea of her toughness even though she’s a nurse, not a robot fighting survivalist or alien exterminator. Yes, I know she does fight aliens at the end, but even if you want to believe that’s foreshadowing, it’s once again using famous sci-fi characters to tell us what to expect out of Cline’s creation rather than trying to do it himself. If he had bothered to build up the mom as tough so that we bought into the idea that she’s shooting lasers at aliens and then compare her to Sarah Connor in a joke or comment, then that might actually pay off in the moment if done well. But then he would have had to come up with a way to describe her early on without using the crutch of references, and that just wasn’t gonna happen.Some might try to say that this is Cline deliberately writing a hero with extremely nerdy obsessions to explore the nature of geek fandom, but that excuse doesn’t fly because almost every single character in this book does the same thing. Even the hard-core military guy in charge of the EDA makes a Top Gun reference when talking to Zach. After all, this is a book written by a guy who drives a goddamn DeLorean so I’m not buying the theory that Cline is just commenting on people who are rabid fans of the '80s when he’s also foaming at the mouth.It’s in just about every conversation, and that highlights another problem with Cline’s dependence on nostalgia. He is so enamored with nerd culture that he thinks that name checking some of its most famous elements is entertaining in and of itself, and he acts like every half-assed joke or quote he tosses out is inherently great just because we’ll recognize where it came from. It’s weirdly out of touch that he writes this like acknowledging a reference puts someone in an exclusive club that only a few like minded souls belong to. When Zach meets the obligatory geek dream girl he falls for after joining the EDA she’s drinking from a flask painted like R2-D2, and that’s supposed to be a sign that they have things in common. As if finding a Star Wars fan in a crowd of some of the best gamers on Earth would be hard to do.I’d also like to point out to Cline that there is a new Star Wars movie coming out in December, and its trailers on You Tube already have several million views. The third Star Trek after the franchise reboot is in production. Hell, even Adam Sandler made an ‘80s video game movie although it sounds like he couldn’t be bothered to put even this low of an amount of effort into it. So this idea that trotting out “May the Force be with you.” is going to be some kind of secret handshake to identify your fellow nerdlingers is pretty much shot to hell in the year 2015. That’s part of the problem with Cline thinking that it’s just enough to reference this stuff. Imagine if we show up to that Star Wars flick, and Harrison Ford is in just one scene and says, “Hi, I’m Han Solo. Remember that time I got frozen in carbonite? Boy, did that suck. See ya later.” There would be riots in the streets if JJ Abrams allowed that to happen because it’s not enough to just mention Han Solo, it only works if Han Solo does something cool as part of the plot.* *(Or at least that’s the way I feel, but for some reason it seems like there are a helluva lot of fans of all kinds out there who will pee themselves at the slightest hint of something they care about. “SQUEEEE!! It makes me SOOOOOO HAPPY just to see a reference to it! Because I love it SOOOOO MUCH! I don’t care if he/she/it just sat in a corner sending text messages for the entire scene instead of doing any of the of things that I originally liked about them to begin with. It was just SOOOOOOO AWESOME to see him/her/it again!!!!” I don’t get that, but it’s not my problem. I’m here to tell you what’s wrong with Cline, not the world.)Essentially Cline is just trying to use things we liked from other works to evoke the same emotions we got from them without bothering to create his own, and he’s shoving as many things in there as possible to give readers a sweet nostalgic glow to paper over that shortcoming. For example, he references Iron Eagle which is a '80s movie about a teenager stealing an Air Force jet and blowing up the Middle East to save his dad. It’s not enough for Cline to cite that or have Zach’s online alias be Iron Beagle. During one scene he has Zach zapping aliens as he listens to Queen’s One Vision from his dad’s old mix tape, but that’s actually done in the movie. Rather than try to build his own moment (Or maybe having a kid from 2015 listen to some music from this century.) Cline points at the film and says, “See, it’s just like that! That’s what I’m trying to tell you!” On the other hand, he kinda has to do this because he’s it’s not like he can rely on his writing ability.I’ve read Stan Lee dialogue in comics from the ‘60s that was less on the nose and had more sub-text. The characters are all paper thin stereotypes. When Cline has to convey that someone is emotionally upset, and he tries to do more than just remind us of a famous movie scene that demonstrates this he repeatedly describes how their faces contort. For example: “His face contorted in anguish.” or “His face contorted in pain.” or “His face contorted in a mask of pain.” There are multiple variations on that phrase used about every other page for a while in the third act. Maybe if Cline checked a thesaurus instead of IMDB once in a while he could find a new verb.The odd thing is that I’m not even that angry at Cline. He’s a shit writer who found a hook that made him insanely popular. It’s not the first time it’s happened, and it won’t be the last. Usually I wouldn’t even read it, and I’d let someone else put his books on the same shelf as Dan Brown and Stephenie Meyer. (Damn, but I am just chumming the waters with troll bait on this one, aren’t I?) But Ready Player One irked me because its set up was a young guy from the future who was essentially trying to live in my past. Armada outright offends me because Cline takes it even further to the point where the book is nothing but references with the barest bones of any kind of original plot to it. He’s unable to craft a real story that might make legitimate use of his ‘80s obsession so he throws a pot of pop culture spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks. It’s a mess, and it’s making me start to hate many of the things I enjoyed during my adolescence after seeing how annoying it is to be subjected to non-stop unfiltered nerd nostalgia.This is also part of a worrisome trend of shitty movies based on toys and games (Transformers, GI Joe, Battleship) as well as outright reboots (Robocop, Total Recall.), and old TV shows being brought back. (X-Files, Twin Peaks & Full House. That's right, we've hit a point as a culture where we apparently crave the familiar so much that bringing Full House back sounds like a good idea to somebody.) If we keep stuffing the same old stuff back in our mouths again and again, we’re eventually going to choke on it. To use a Cline tactic of borrowing something from pop culture for my own purposes I’ll modify a quote from True Detective: “My strong suspicion is that we get the sci-fi we deserve.”I’m really starting to worry that’s true. So let’s try to change it. How about if you’re craving the concept of this book you go watch that Futurama episode Space Invaders instead? Trust me, it’s a lot better.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16278318-armada

They were creative.Cynical Natalie: Wish she'd put some of that creativity towards the romance. It's bland as fuck and twice as squicky when you see it's eerily similar to Fifty Shades of Grey. Hot billionaire falls in love with a girl lower on the social/wealth rung for no apparent reason, pays all her bills, then flies her out to Tokyo on a private jet.Nice Natalie: That's unfair! You can't lump all billionaire romances together with Fifty Shades.Cynical Natalie: I can and I will. Books aren't written in a vacuum. She should have realized Hideo and Emika resembled Christian and Ana.Nice Natalie: Emika isn't anything like Ana, nor Hideo like Christian. She's spirited and clever and stubborn—Cynical Natalie: God, I hate the description ""stubborn."" Bella Swan and every TSTL Paranormal Romance heroine after her pulverized that word to watery soup. It's not even an insult anymore. It's a compliment dressed like a nightmare. If you ask me, Emika is June 2.0. Her criminal record, the one that haunts her permanent record, making her *gasp* morally grey, is the result of her defending the weak. Her soul is vanilla through and through. Why couldn't she have gotten it by doing something selfish but also sympathetic, like hacking bank accounts to pay the bills after her dad died?Nice Natalie: Just because you're going through an antihero phase doesn't make good characters bad.Cynical Natalie: Hey, I love Wonder Woman just as much as you, and she's as pure-hearted as they come. To prove, I'll tag a gif:What I don't like are boring characters. One-note caricatures. Plus, Emika's relationship with her dad is tragically one-dimensional. In Six of Crows, Kaz Brekker shares a nuanced, layered relationship with his decreased brother. Jordie had been wrongfully swindled, but part of the blame lay in his greed, and Kaz recognizes that. He's able to see his brother as a victim and the protector who abandoned him, no matter how unwillingly. Emika and her father's relationship could've been something like that. Rage for him dying, for the debts, for leaving her alone and penniless. Love for the memories, for inspiring her rainbow-colored hair, for never forgetting to ask about her day. Instead we get a flat I-miss-him narrative. I could forgive it in her debut novel. Not now.Nice Natalie: Must you hold up Six of Crows as the bar for everything?Cynical Natalie: Do we love Taylor Swift?Nice Natalie: It's not all bad. There's good diversity representation. Asher—handsome, sought after Asher—uses a wheelchair. Don't forget the other PoC from a range of different cultures and countries. Hideo, the love interest, is Asian, too.Cynical Natalie: Thank you for bringing Hideo, I almost forgot. Why did he fall for Emika? The gal I get—he's her idol and made all her dreams come true. Him, ehhh.Nice Natalie: What's not to like about her? She speaks her mind and is a brilliant hacker.Cynical Natalie: Yes. Because there's no way Hideo has come across an independent, sassy woman once in his course as CEO of a multi-billion dollar company.Nice Natalie: Do you not have a romantic bone in your body?Cynical Natalie: Not in my body, no. But I do have a pretty nice collection in my basement.Before you get all moony-eyed, remember we guessed all the twists, including one that was so soap-opera-ish, I still can't believe Lu included it. Zero is Sasuke. That is so embarrassing, I'm getting secondhand heat wavesNice Natalie: Just because we know how a story is going to end, it doesn't spoil the journey. We were really happy when we spotted all those Easter eggs from her previous books: a Warcross team named Windwalkers; Asher's big brother is called Daniel Wing; and the merit system in Japan, where you earn points for doing something small like watering a plant, mimics that of Antarctica from Legend's dystopian setting. Warcross is like a distant prequel. Lu confirmed it on her Twitter, too.Cynical Natalie: Big deal.Nice Natalie: It is a big deal. That earns half a star at least.Cynical Natalie: Oh no, you don't. We're going to be objective. Two stars and that's because I'm happy Taylor Swift's Reputation is coming out in two weeks.Nice Natalie: Two stars are for books we hate!Cynical Natalie: No, one star is for books we hate. But since you insist, one star.Nice Natalie: No!Cynical Natalie: 0.5. Do I hear a bid for 0.5?Nice Natalie: At least make it a solid four.Cynical Natalie: In your glitter-powdered dreams. Two, take it or leave it.Nice Natalie: THREE. And an extra 0.5 because we really do love you, Marie. I'm sorry I can't do more.Cynical Natalie: I'm not. Now where's my Taylor t-shirt?

Shift;Hugh Howey;2013;2010;579;4.12;114883;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];Hugh Howey goes back to show the first days of the Silo, and the beginning of the end In 2007, the Center for Automation in Nanobiotech (CAN) outlined the hardware and software platforms that would one day allow robots smaller than human cells to make medical diagnoses, conduct repairs, and even self-propagate. In the same year, the CBS network re-aired a program about the effects of propranolol on sufferers of extreme trauma. A simple pill, it had been discovered, could wipe out the memory of any traumatic event. At almost the same moment in humanity’s broad history, mankind discovered the means for bringing about its utter downfall. And the ability to forget it ever happened.;*Buddy Read with Rachel*(BAVR)Have you ever been happily reading a good book? You’re about to find out what happens to the protagonist. Your heart is pounding with anticipation. When all of a sudden, out of nowhere, the book dumps you into a ridiculously long ass flashback. Everything comes to a complete and utter stop. It’s like being trapped in a meandering shaggy dog story. And of course you’ve got to read the damn flashback, because if you don’t you may not completely grasp the full ramifications of the ending. Well, Shift is a 600 page, doorstopper flashback. To be honest, I sort of hated the book even before I began. I wanted to go forwards, not backwards. But I tried to stay optimistic. After all, I loved Wool. I loved the nostalgia Wool generated in me for classic SciFi. I loved the suspense. The characters were cool. I was ready to take the plunge.Unfortunately, Shift is a long and tedious read. First off, there’s little suspense. After all, it's a prequel, so of course I knew basically what was going to happen. Howey also had the audacity to drag it out. He kept describing the same things over and over again. I started counting how many times he mentions a tomato, or tomato soup, or tomato paste. The dead guys looked like tomato sauce was on them. Howey also likes to talk about the circular staircase in the silo and overalls. Bored, I started to wonder what these overalls are made of? It better not be cotton? They don’t have the room. And speaking of room, how can they grow so much wheat? How are their computers lasting for centuries (mine usually crash after ten years). And what is the hierarchy for the powers that be? Even Donald doesn’t know that for sure and he lives there?  And the absolute worst was that lame ass, WTF reason they blew up the world? I couldn’t believe that nobody, and I mean nobody, questions Thurman and his cronies? You’ve got to be kidding me?  Don’t tell me that the US Air Force was willing to blow up their own US cities, because I don’t buy it. And what?? They couldn’t work on finding a way to stop the Nanos, or make a stand-off, like we did for years with Russia and nuclear bombs during the cold war? Their only solution was to blow up the world, otherwise they would just have years of back and forth Nano warfare? Are you serious? And what was all that crap at the end about how only one silo can survive because people would kill each other. What, people can’t work together? Only in Howey’s world. Can I say PLOT HOLE?! *end of rant* In fact, there are several plot holes in Shift. Most of them have to do with character motivation and time. But let’s forget about that for a minute. Let’s talk about the characters.Donald -- God I hated that guy. I swear the whole book is him having a pity party. I could handle it in the beginning (after all, horrible things happen to him) but by the third book I wanted to rip his head off. I know Donald is supposed to be a sympathetic character because he was duped and deceived, but let’s face it, he purposely tried to stay uninformed. That was his goal, to bury his head in the sand, even when obvious hints were thrown his way. I think he’s one of the biggest, redundant and whiney, woobie characters I’ve read in a long time. And the thing that finally tips him over the edge made my eyes roll. Turman’s been slaughtering people for years and Don finally decides to do something about it because he finally figured out that Anna purposely separated him from his wife? wtf? Thurman – Is a total nutcase. How come nobody notices that? I think that’s what drove me bonkers. Everybody was just so willing and happy to put Charles Manson in charge of national security. Supposedly Thurman is so charismatic, people just melt like butter and agree with him after just a few minutes. Like Rodney -- who went through the most bogus character arc I’ve seen in a while. Does Howey honestly expect us to believe that milquetoast Donald is the only person to try and stop Thurman? Give me a break?   Anna – I kept wondering what the hell she saw in Donald? The trouble she goes to winning him baffled me.Mission – Was boring and had no personality. Of course, most of the characters didn’t have much of a personality. It probably didn’t help that in Mission’s scenes, Howey spends long passages describing life in the Silo one more time (like I didn’t get enough of that in Wool?) Solo – His story is very sad. But let’s face it, we already knew what was going to happen to him. Shadow -- Was purposely put in the book to make Solo’s life even sadder. GrrrCharlotte -- Who’s that?Helen -- Made me think of June Cleaver.  In conclusion, this book annoyed me. I loved Wool. I wanted to read Dust, but now I’m not so sure. Howey should have left the past a mystery.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17306293-shift

Her entire world confined to its spaces, she's never thought to dream of what lies beyond its doors. So when her mother goes missing, Aria knows her chances of surviving in the outer wasteland long enough to find her are slim.Then Aria meets an outsider named Perry. He's searching for someone too. He's also wild—a savage—but might be her best hope at staying alive.If they can survive, they are each other's best hope for finding answers.;"Sometimes your book reading experience comes down to one single factor: Do you like the MC?That character can make or break a book.Name the biggest praise and the biggest complaint about J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. If you said they're both Holden Caulfield then you get the gold star. This book was teetering on a precipice for me. It could either land back on solid ground or go toppling off into the deep end. eventually, the main characters, Aria and Perry, are what stacked it back to being a great read.There's a lot to like about Rossi's futuristic science-fiction novel. The world building is fascinating and vivid, yet simplistic enough for most audiences to grasp reasonably well. The writing is fair enough and I felt that it was reasonably tight and serviceable. It wasn't a perfect novel but I feel that it achieved what it was meant to and that was inspiring me to invest in Aria and Perry's story. Mostly I'm just impressed with Rossi because she clearly is a badass.I can just imagine how her meeting with the editor went:""Ms. Rossi, thank you for coming. We love your first copy but we're concerned about this Aether thing. What is it? Where did it come from? How does it work?""Rossi sits back in her chair and kicks her feet up onto the editor's table. She pulls out a raw falcon egg and starts eating it. ""So?"" she asks between bites.""Well, you never clarify how it works? Why it's there? How did it come to be there?""Rossi shrugs casually. ""Meh. I don't give a shit. It's there. YA takes it for granted that a 108 year old vampire would fall in love with a teenager. They'll figure out this Aether shit. They have google.""""But-"" the editor tries to continue.Rossi pins the editor with a withering gaze. ""I could devote ten boring pages to giving some lameass sciency explanation of the Aether or I could add in 20% more awesome. Also, I know how to falcon punch. I learned it from the mother of this egg I stole before I gave a right hook and uppercut to a shark.""The editor decides that surrender is the better part of valor and everyone learns an important lesson that day. Especially the wild life. The End.So basically, I like this book, and even if Rossi does eat raw falcon eggs, I like her characters and I like her style.And hopefully you will too. If you know what's good for you.This review also appears on my blog, Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11594257-under-the-never-sky

Cibola Burn;James S.A. Corey;2014;2010;581;4.22;111695;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy'];The fourth novel in James S.A. Corey’s New York Times bestselling Expanse seriesThe gates have opened the way to thousands of habitable planets, and the land rush has begun. Settlers stream out from humanity's home planets in a vast, poorly controlled flood, landing on a new world. Among them, the Rocinante, haunted by the vast, posthuman network of the protomolecule as they investigate what destroyed the great intergalactic society that built the gates and the protomolecule.But Holden and his crew must also contend with the growing tensions between the settlers and the company which owns the official claim to the planet. Both sides will stop at nothing to defend what's theirs, but soon a terrible disease strikes and only Holden - with help from the ghostly Detective Miller - can find the cure.;This book was the clunker to end all clunkers. The dud to end all duds. The turd in your soup, if you will. In other words, it was a bad book. First of all, the book can’t figure out it’s own plot. Twenty pages in and the book thinks it’s going to be about immigration, evil corporations and land rights. Oh, but then it’s not. Halfway in and the book thinks it’s going to be about natural disasters. But then it’s about killer slugs and orbital decay?...neither of which was interesting. At the end, the book thinks it’s going to be about the big, mysterious alien race and object. But just kidding, because nothing is revealed about the mysterious alien race in their completely forgettable and awkward scenes. So, after having finished the book, I’m hard pressed to tell you what it was actually about because none of the plots mattered. The immigration section had no bearing on the later portion of the book. The natural disaster had no bearing on the book. And the final encounter with the aliens was shoehorned in and didn’t matter one whit. Lots of stuff happened but nothing actually happened.Nor did the plot create any tension or fear. I was never nervous that the bad guy would win or that a main character would get hurt. Nothing. No emotion. No connection. Just irritation that I was five hundred pages in and nothing of consequence had happened. Strike one.The novel’s characters were equally crap. Holden, our hero, should have been the most interesting, what with Miller floating around in his head, but he spends the majority of his time mediating (without actually mediating) and killing killer slugs. And never has killing space slugs been so boring. Holden’s crew was just as dull: Amos was turned into a two-dimensional good-guy who follows the captain’s orders, but who would be killing you if he wasn't following the captain’s orders. Blah. Alex and Naomi are just sorta there. Did they do anything? I can't remember. All three of Holden’s crew could have been removed from the book and no one would have noticed. Strike two.What about the other point-of-view characters? you ask. Well, Basia could have been an interesting character as a would-be terrorist seeking redemption for killing people in terrorist-y ways, but instead he mopes and whines.The antagonist, Murtry (now there’s a name that strikes fear in your heart) was also stupidly two-dimensional, nothing more than a “I love the Comp’ny! and have been charged with protecting the Comp’ny! Therefore, I will smile smugly while I shoot you in the face (or back) with my Comp’ny gun! just to make a point for all these rubes here who need to know that I love the Comp’ny! And an intelligent thought will ne'er enter my brain-box!” type character. And finally, in the category of Worst Character of the Year, the most egregious of all, scientist Elvi, who single handedly set back the feminist movement by decades. Elvi is a young-ish biologist, who, after experiencing tragedy in the opening chapters, cries crocodile tears at the drop of an estrogen-fueled hat, until our hero, the sexy James Holden shows up. At which point she turns into a 1930’s girl, coming up with every excuse to see sexy James Holden so she can get that mushy feeling inside while she babbles (because, you know, a girl in love can’t help but talk at the speed of light when her secret crush is around), and falls asleep at night dreaming of sexy James Holden running his manly hands all over her body, to the point that she can’t function as a scientist. Until, that is, her fellow scientist (who is not sexy James Holden) suggests that she could do her job better if she just got laid, and oh, he’s available for sex right now. And she accepts his offer. And after she’s gotten some piece of action, she turns back into a cold, calculating scientist. Ah, the magic of sex. Robert Heinlein, eat your heart out. Strike three. Yer out!This book missed everything that makes science fiction fun to read. Action scenes? Poorly written. Interesting plot? Tissue-paper thin. Compelling characters? Nadda. Brain-twisting science? Nope. Sense of wonder and awe? Never. Strike four...? Man, I haven’t even touched on the completely pointless algae that makes you go blind subplot, either. Strike five...?This series had great potential after its riveting start - I really enjoyed the characters and set up from Leviathan Wakes. Books two and three, Caliban's War and Abaddon's Gate, had some great ideas and moments, but the cracks were starting to show. In this book, the house came down...or the batter struck out...after five strikes... (hm...metaphors are not my strong suit...). This book was nothing but fluff and nonsense, and I doubt that I’ll be reading the next one.It’s just too bad - I really wanted to like this series...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18656030-cibola-burn

If you want me to go into more detail, I can. But that's the heart of the matter.I don't do spoilers. So instead, let me say this: This book was fun. It was clever. It was geeky. But most of all, it made me laugh. I'm not just saying it was funny. I'm saying I actually laughed out loud in the restaurant where I was reading it. Then later at the coffee shop. Then later still when I was reading it at home, even though I was alone in the house. Even though that's what crazy people do. I can honestly say I can't think of another book that ever made me laugh this much. Ever. So yeah. It's good stuff. A+. My one problem with this book is that it makes me feel a little threatened. I know John Scalzi. I like him. We're both successful authors, and we both live very happily in our respective corners of the sky. He writes snappy, clever sci-fi with good plot and action. I write huge tangled metafictional fantasy thingers. This is a good thing. It means that while we're neighbors, we're somewhat distant neighbors. This makes it easier for us to be friends, because we're both doing our own thing on our own ends of the street, metaphorically speaking.But now Scalzi has gone all meta. That's my turf. If this book wasn't so entertaining, I'd want to send some big, broad-shouldered men around to his house to look menacing and say things like, ""Mr Rothfuss is worried about some of the writing you have been doing in his neighborhood. When Mr. Rothfuss gets worried about things, sometimes people get mysteriously hurt. With an axe handle."" So yeah. Thanks for the early look at the book, Scalzi. Thanks for the vastly entertaining read. Just remember. Axe handle.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13055592-redshirts
Ancillary Justice;Ann Leckie;2013;2010;386;3.99;109476;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Space'];(Alternate cover edition of ISBN 031624662X / 9780316246620.) On a remote, icy planet, the soldier known as Breq is drawing closer to completing her quest. Once, she was the Justice of Toren - a colossal starship with an artificial intelligence linking thousands of soldiers in the service of the Radch, the empire that conquered the galaxy. Now, an act of treachery has ripped it all away, leaving her with one fragile human body, unanswered questions, and a burning desire for vengeance.;"Most of my friends are married now and have 1 or 2 kids. I like kids, but once in a while you meet one of those kids that everyone adores and that is very clever and friendly, but for some reason I simply don't get along with that particular kid. Unfortunately, for me ""Ancillary Justice"" is that kid.In ""Ancillary Justice"" we're following 2 plot lines for most of the novel. In the present storyline we follow Breq, the last physical manifestation of the ship ""Justice of Toren's"" complex AI. In the Radch empire ships are sentient and control a multitude of physical bodies called ancillaries. After the destruction of her ship Breq is on a quest to get justice for said destruction.This storyline alternates with a second narrative set 19 years in the past and explains what led to the destruction of the ship.What makes the novel unique and is in my opinion the main reason for its huge success among critics are 3 stylistic elements.The one most talked about is an element of the language of the Radch, because their language only knows one grammatical gender. The Radch -and therefore Breq- refer to everyone as ""she"". So one of the main novelties of the book is that for some characters you'll have to figure out and decide on your own, if a character is male or female.The second unique element is the ship's ability to communicate with multiple persons in various places at the same time, due to her omnipresence onboard and use of an army of ancillaries on the ground.So there are some discussions, where the ship speaks with multiple persons at the same time and the conversations overlap. But this is done without being too messy, mostly only two conversations happen at the same time and the effect is not overused.The third unique element is of course Breq herself, due to her not being human. To emphasize this effect the prose feels very cold and distanced.From my point of view the success of the novel for each reader depends on how much you are personally fascinated by the uniqueness of those elements, because frankly the novel doesn't offer much beyond these elements.Due to the cold and distanced prose, I was never really engaged in the novel. It's like having someone show you an abstract painting of 5 triangles and explaining that those triangles represent something really clever. My head may appreciate the explanation, but all I really see are 5 rather boring triangles. As you might see, I'm not a very artsy person.And as a former philosophy student, who did a few courses of philosophy of language, the idea of the singular grammatical gender was one I could wrap my head around pretty quickly, as we did some very similar experiments with language and so the effect on me was not as fascinating as I hoped it would be.So, to bring a little Freud into the discussion, my Super-Ego was able to appreciate Anne Leckie's efforts in creating a unique experience, but my Id was, frankly, bored to death by the novel.It's major weakness in my opinion is the lack of an engaging plot. The main narrative stands still for most of the novel and has to wait until the past storyline catches up.There are multiple chapters in an abandoned hut, where the characters do a lot of sitting, eating and sleeping and the narrative only painfully crawls forward. The second storyline in the past is far more interesting in my opinion and especially the last chapters set onboard the ""Justice of Toren"" were my personal highlight.Unfortunately, the last third of the novel then just stays with the first narrative and comes to a conclusion I wasn't interested in and felt highly constructed.The second thing that didn't work for me at all were the characters. Beside maybe from Lt. Awn in the second storyline, I wasn't able to connect with a single character, least of all with the main character Breq and her constant inconsistencies in character. In one chapter she's very cold and distanced, in the next she shows a lot of human emotion that seemed uncalled for. I don't know, if Leckie wanted to achieve the feeling of a character torn between humanity and rationality, but this conflict is a rather over-used trope of SF and many other authors did it better in my opinion.Another character that drove me mad is Seivarden, a Radch Breq takes care of in the main plotline. His integration is a borderline offence to my intelligence as a reader.He is a mere plot device for Breq to achive something at the end of the book and it feels that this is his only purpose. To make him not that obvious a ""deus ex machina"" element Leckie just lets Breq literally stumble over him in the first chapter. Then, of course, he has no use for 250 pages, so the author decides to let him sleep for most of the time or be unconscious. To create the illusion of depth she attaches a random drug issue for him (of all the boring standard flaws, the most unimaginative of them all), that is never really addressed or taken seriously, because we all know that he's a plot device, so why bother?A thing I liked better was the world-building. The whole culture of the aggressive Radch with their devotion to religion and formality is really fascinating and some of the more alien elements piqued my interest.I personally would have enjoyed a bit more in-depth information, because when Leckie does world-building, it was very interesting, but most of the time we just get the information that we absolutely need to understand what's going on.So, to make an already long review not even longer. I'm not blind to the intellectual merits of the novel and can understand why people praise the book for it.But for me personally the basics of the book, especially plot and characters didn't work out, so unfortunately I can only say that this book was okay for me, but nothing I really enjoyed.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333324-ancillary-justice

Iron Gold;Pierce Brown;2018;2010;602;4.23;107970;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Dystopia', 'Young Adult', 'Adult'];They call him father, liberator, warlord, Reaper. But he feels a boy as he falls toward the pale blue planet, his armor red, his army vast, his heart heavy. It is the tenth year of war and the thirty-second of his life. A decade ago, Darrow was the hero of the revolution he believed would break the chains of the Society. But the Rising has shattered everything: Instead of peace and freedom, it has brought endless war. Now he must risk everything he has fought for on one last desperate mission. Darrow still believes he can save everyone, but can he save himself? And throughout the worlds, other destinies entwine with Darrow’s to change his fate forever:  A young Red girl flees tragedy in her refugee camp and achieves for herself a new life she could never have imagined. An ex-soldier broken by grief is forced to steal the most valuable thing in the galaxy—or pay with his life. And Lysander au Lune, the heir in exile to the sovereign, wanders the stars with his mentor, Cassius, haunted by the loss of the world that Darrow transformed, and dreaming of what will rise from its ashes. Red Rising was the story of the end of one universe, and Iron Gold is the story of the creation of a new one. Witness the beginning of a stunning new saga of tragedy and triumph from masterly New York Times bestselling author Pierce Brown.;"I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/petrikleoA bloodydamn spellbinding return to my number one favorite sci-fi series of all time.There haven’t been any changes to my list of favorite authors of all time for a year now. I’m gratified to say that after reading his Red Rising trilogy and Iron Gold, Pierce Brown deserves to be included in the list.For those of you who don’t know, Iron Gold is the continuation of the highly acclaimed Red Rising trilogy, which has now become a saga; making this book the fourth installment in the Red Rising Saga. The story takes place ten years after the end of Morning Star and to tell you what the book is about—spoiler-free, of course—there’s really no better way than to let Pierce Brown himself explain it:

“Iron Gold is about the struggle to preserve liberty in a bleak landscape, where heroes of the past look suspiciously like villains and the inspiring dream of liberty has been hijacked by politicians, dirtied by social strife, and muddled by interest groups and competing factions. How in such a world can good prevail? On the back of one man? Certainly not. It takes a village—a host of disparate people who, despite their conflicting views and disparate pasts, must band together to find their own purpose, to replenish the dream of liberty with their own sacrifices and come together for the common good…”–Pierce Brown 

Full article here: https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/1...There you have it. And as for my thoughts and review, here it goes.I found the plot of Iron Gold to be superbly compelling; it was extremely hard to put down, and the pacing was executed masterfully. Most of the chapters in this book tended to end on a cliffhanger, and there wasn’t any moment where I was bored, not even for one bloodydamn page. The main reason for this is the transition to a multi-POV narration. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely loved the first trilogy; told solely through Darrow’s perspective, the first-person narration in the first trilogy was utterly magnificent and immersive. However, if Pierce really intends to continue this series with another trilogy, I honestly don’t think another single character POV would be a good idea; it might end up becoming tedious, to say the least. Hence, this is why the shift in narration to a four-character multi-POV was a brilliant move. Picture: The main POV characters of Iron Gold. Art by Magali Villeneuve.Seeing the plot unfolding from several characters’ perspectives with different backgrounds and personalities instead of one provided the series with a new level of depth and complexity, especially regarding the characters and scope of the series. I immensely enjoyed the grand and majestic story told here. Pierce Brown really knows how to create a dramatic, dynamic, and cinematic reading experience in his books; every character’s POV was engaging and addictive in their own way. Iron Gold is the biggest installment in the series so far, but it still felt too short for me; I finished it within three days. Each word kept me turning the pages late into the night, and Brown also managed to connect the few loose ends from Morning Star seamlessly. It’s a book about liberty, penance, politics, love, and many more aspects that contains a heavy resemblance to our society. This is actually one of many reasons why I love Red Rising Saga; even though this is a sci-fi series and the majority of the time the story doesn’t even take place on Earth, the themes still felt incredibly scary and relatable. It was almost prophetic how the mayhem in this book and series can be correlated to our world and civilizations.

“I know it may be impossible to believe now, when everything is dark and broken, but you will survive this pain, little one. Pain is a memory. You will live and you will struggle and you will find joy. And you will remember your family from this breath to your dying days, because love does not fade. Love is the stars, and its light carries on long after death.”

I’ve talked already about the brilliant narrative change to multi-POV, but to be honest, I had my doubts about this at first due to the fact that these four POVs were all done in first person POV. There’s nothing wrong with it; I’m just more used to multiple third-person POVs. I really shouldn’t have worried; Pierce Brown nailed it with finesse. Not only was the story more epic in scope, but more importantly, Brown successfully made each character's distinct voices and personalities shine, even when all four of them were done in first-person narration. Although it took me a while to warm up to one of the POV characters, once I was halfway through the book, I was fully engrossed in the four POV characters equally. These character’s emotions, their rage, friendships, loss, love, and dilemmas, they were easily palpable through each word that Pierce carved; it was emotionally impactful for me. All the characters in Iron Gold were flawed and genuine; they’re complex, and the burden of their past and the weight of their choices and actions felt believable. They did questionable things with understandable motivations, and I loved this book more because of that. Humans are complex by nature, and Iron Gold exhibited just how complex each individual can be, especially when they’re all trapped in the cycle of death, hatred, and violence. It’s safe to say that I’m emotionally invested in all the characters, both main and side.One of the things that differ in this novel compared to the previous three books was the action scenes. And I’m not talking about the quality because those have always been exhilarating and breathtaking since Golden Son. Iron Gold is not an exception to this; pulse-pounding, explosive, and stunning as ever. Iron Gold, however, contained more violent scenes, and they were written elegantly. The set-pieces, the buildup, the execution; they all made the action scenes so powerful and beautifully destructive, and I thoroughly loved them.Picture: Deepgrave by Sam BurleyPierce Brown also did a spectacular job with his world-building in Iron Gold; it was enlightening to read what has transpired to the characters during the past ten years—in the narrative—within the solar system. We also get to see the character’s journeys on several different planets. The settings, atmosphere, and weather were vividly described, and this, in my opinion, enhanced the reading experience. That said, my favorite part of the world-building in Iron Gold was the exploration of cultural differences between the colors; it’s fascinating to witness how myriad of changes doesn’t immediately mean that circumstances have indeed improved. And the implementation of Japanese culture in the House Raa family was especially delightful for me to read. For example, the terms gahja (outsiders) that the House Raa used probably derives from the word gaijin, which means foreigners. Plus, the House Raa upholds the code of honor and respect reminiscent of the Japanese culture.Picture: Iron Gold by Sam BurleyBefore Brown’s Red Rising trilogy became a saga, the division between those who loved and those who hated the series stemmed primarily from Brown’s prose. Fortunately, I fell on the loving side, and I continue to love his writing style. I always think of Pierce’s prose as evocative, philosophical, compelling, vivid, and elegant. From my observation, his capability to pull off first-person present tense is top-tiered. In addition to that, the prologue of Iron Gold displayed a fraction of the amazing story he can tell if he decides to write a novel from third-person perspective narration one day. I hope it will happen one day; the prologue was short, and it was transcendent. Regardless of my wishful thinking, this once more demonstrated Brown’s incredible talent as a writer.

“It is my duty as a free man to read so I'm not blind being lead around by my nose” 

The year 2018 has only just begun, and I’m confident that Iron Gold will be included not only as one of my favorite reads of the year but also as one of my favorite books of all time. Personally speaking, Iron Gold is my second favorite installment in the series so far; just below Golden Son, and it is up there with . Red Rising Saga is truly my favorite sci-fi series of all time, and I highly recommend this to all sci-fi fans.One final thing. I’ll leave this passage from the acknowledgments in this book for all of you to read because trust me, Pierce Brown understands his readers. Who knows? This could be the extra push for those of you who are trapped in the Bermuda Triangle of Fantasy (George R. R. Martin, Patrick Rothfuss, Scott Lynch) to finally invest in the Red Rising Saga if you haven’t. “A single, standalone book is a fling. A series such as this is a relationship between author and reader. You trusted me to give me your time, your imagination through the initial trilogy. And, by buying this book, you trusted me yet again.So my greatest thanks to you, the reader, for that trust. Know that I do not take it lightly, and will not abuse it as we spin further down the rabbit hole.” –Pierce BrownSide note: The homage to A Song of Ice and Fire is perfection.“House Leo sends their regards.”Okay relax boyo, there is no House Leo.

Severance;Ling  Ma;2018;2010;291;3.91;107251;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Contemporary', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook'];Candace Chen, a millennial drone self-sequestered in a Manhattan office tower, is devoted to routine. So she barely notices when a plague of biblical proportions sweeps New York. Then Shen Fever spreads. Families flee. Companies halt operations. The subways squeak to a halt. Soon entirely alone, still unfevered, she photographs the eerie, abandoned city as the anonymous blogger NY Ghost.Candace won’t be able to make it on her own forever, though. Enter a group of survivors, led by the power-hungry IT tech Bob. They’re traveling to a place called the Facility, where, Bob promises, they will have everything they need to start society anew. But Candace is carrying a secret she knows Bob will exploit. Should she escape from her rescuers?A send-up and takedown of the rituals, routines, and missed opportunities of contemporary life, Ling Ma’s Severance is a quirky coming-of-adulthood tale and satire.;"4.5 starsThis book stopped me right in my tracks - literally. I read it in the span of five hours; I could not put it down. In Severance, Ling Ma shares the story of Candace Chen, a self-described millennial worker drone who spends much of her life sequestered in a Manhattan office tower. With both of her parents recently deceased and no other family or close friends, she has little else to do, aside from going to work and watching movies in a Greenpoint basement with her boyfriend. Candace thus feels little emotion when the Shen Fever hits, a plague that renders people into non-violent zombie versions of themselves, doomed to repeat the same rote tasks over and over until they become fully unconscious. The story flashes between Candace's life before the Shen Fever hits, as well as after, when she travels with a group of survivors led by a power-hungry, authoritarian man named Bob.Ling Ma creates an excellent atmosphere in Severance. While reading, I felt claustrophobic, trapped, and hooked into the story all at the same time - similar to how a lot of millennials feel within late-stage capitalism. The flashbacks and flashforwards worked well here, as they served to deepen Candace's character and backstory while also propelling the narrative forward. Within this tight, gripping plot, Ma inserts commentary about the deadening, devastating effects of capitalism that strikes a skillful balance between serious and satirical. Every element of this story - the zombie apocalypse, Candace's coming-of-age, the dive into corporate life - all came together in a dark, entrancing, and unputdownable way.I have to say my heart broke when Ma wrote about Candace's immigrant parents and how their assimilation to the United States involved the absorption of capitalism. The way she wrote about Candace's father's relationship with work and her mother's relationship with material goods felt so true to my own immigrant family's experience in this country. Taking this aspect of the novel together with a reveal about Candace that happens pretty early in the story, I appreciated how Ma weaves in understated yet powerful insights about race, gender, and exploitation of foreign labor throughout the book.A quirky, cynical, yet important read that has made me think a lot about what matters most in my life (hint: it's leaning toward my close friends and mentees/students, not my work). The style of this book reminded me of Weike Wang's 
Chemistry
 and Gabe Habash's

 vibes too. Highly recommended to those critical of society's emphasis on work who also want a unique, well-written story.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36348525-severance
Son;Lois Lowry;2012;2010;393;3.99;105606;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Audiobook'];They called her Water Claire. When she washed up on their shore, no one knew that she came from a society where emotions and colors didn’t exist. That she had become a Vessel at age thirteen. That she had carried a Product at age fourteen. That it had been stolen from her body. Claire had a son. But what became of him she never knew. What was his name? Was he even alive? She was supposed to forget him, but that was impossible. Now Claire will stop at nothing to find her child, even if it means making an unimaginable sacrifice. Son thrusts readers once again into the chilling world of the Newbery Medal winning book, The Giver, as well as Gathering Blue and Messenger where a new hero emerges. In this thrilling series finale, the startling and long-awaited conclusion to Lois Lowry’s epic tale culminates in a final clash between good and evil.;"no no no no no no no No No No No NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NONONONONONONONONONONONONONO 
NO
, Lois Lowry! 

NO.

No. This cannot be how you chose to end the quartet. I am flabbergasted and bereft and... cheated. I feel cheated. In the same way Suzanne Collins ruined The Hunger Games trilogy in its crummy final act, so too has Lowry with Son. Despite being weaker efforts, Gathering Blue and Messenger felt like stepping stones toward an ending that would seamlessly combine disparate storylines. Instead we get this.(I am well aware now that this review has begun as a rambling mess. I am sorting through my emotions as I type, and am hopeful that everything will come together in the end - UNLIKE SON.)Divided into three parts (Before, Between, and Beyond), Son begins strongly. 
Before
Here is Claire, a child of fourteen, forced to live the life of a birthmother in a society that is a striking cross between Margaret Atwood's The Handmaids Tale and George Orwell's 1984. Fully realized in the Newbery Medal winning The Giver, it is a richly drawn community that provokes unease in the reader through subtlety. Claire's character is developed beautifully, and readers will feel her ache and longing as she navigates the oppressive system in which she has been unwittingly thrust. Lowry is at her sharpest in the Before section. The narrative travels at a piercing clip, and the tumult of Claire's emotions is palpable in the same manner of Jonas' own emergence in The Giver. Further details about the community are provided, each simultaneously intriguing and sickening. It is a section that is gripping and thrilling and that, unfortunately, ends. And the trouble begins.Spoilers from here on out. BetweenClaire escapes in a cargo boat once the society begins to collapse (presumably because Jonas has escaped with Gabe and has unleashed memories on the community). Lowry doesn't spend too much time explaining this. She doesn't have to. It is artfully rendered in The Giver. Something happens to the cargo boat and Claire is lost at sea, eventually washing up on the shores of a village that sits at the base of a towering cliff. This is a self-sustaining village, despite being cut off from the rest of the world. There are cows and sheep, so everyone can eat. Also there are fisherman. These fisherman have boats, so anyone can leave this enclave at any time. Oh, wait. No, they can't. In order to leave, one must climb the cliff. (Lois Lowry, award-winning author, can get away with these types of gaping plot holes, right? No, she can't. But she does.) It is in Between that we spend 140 pages of Claire getting acquainted with the new community and training to climb the cliff.Oh, come on.No, really. COME ON.Also, Claire is a bit of a bitch. In order to survive the climb, she murders a bunch of baby gulls so the mother gull won't attack her. Why is this in the narrative? Because it is. Maybe it shows her mettle? I don't know. It was stupid and pointless. But not as stupid and pointless as what happens in...BeyondCLAIRE MADE IT TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF!! YAY!!And now she's living in the village from Messenger. Because of a foolish trade with the Trademaster, she's an old lady. Like, super old. Ancient. And she's been in the village for seven years, watching Gabe like a creepy stalker (but never saying anything to him because it might hurt him and because perhaps her story is too unbelievable to tell). But she eventually tells it anyway. To Jonas. Who then tells Gabe. Who then goes and fights the Trademaster. Who turns out to be... wait for it... the embodiment of evil. Wait, what? What was the point of The Giver if this is the final message? Evil is bad. You should fight Evil so you can continue to be Good.No shit, Lois Lowry. No. Shit.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13324841-son
Dust;Hugh Howey;2013;2010;416;4.24;104660;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"The much-anticipated final instalment of the Wool trilogy.In the aftermath of the uprising, the people of Silo 18 are coming to terms with a new order. Some embrace the change, others fear the unknown; none have control of their fate.The Silo is still in danger.There are those set on its destruction.Jules knows they must be stopped.The battle has been won.The war is just beginning.";"Giving the finale to the Silo series a three star rating was not easy, as I've rated the previous books much higher. The Wool Omnibus was one of my favorite books of all time. I've recommended it to numerous friends and have a signed copy of it on my bookshelf. This one, however, left me a bit disappointed. This review is mostly spoiler-free, and spoilers will be tagged/hidden.Let me start with the positives. Howey once again does a great job of immersing you in the underground world of the silo and its inhabitants, making their struggles seem so real and periodically making me feel claustrophobic. It's as tremendously well-written as the previous books when it comes to storytelling. The story continues seamlessly from where SHIFT and WOOL left off and contains many tense moments that glue your eyes to the page. Throughout the whole novel I felt an overwhelming sense of dread, thinking there'd be no way there would be a happy conclusion.One thing that's bothered me not just about this novel but the series as a whole is the lack of character diversity. The dialogue is well written and realistic, but the words that a character says could just as well be said by any other character. This is even more true in DUST. I never at once felt that any of the characters had any specific qualities or traits attached to them. Even Solo, the most unique character due to his circumstances, acted just like everyone else. I was impressed that Wool had a strong female protagonist, but in Dust another female protagonist is brought in that acts no different than Juliette. Scenes with Shirly felt just like scenes with Courtneee. Lukas, Raph, and Erik all felt like the same person to me. It also seemed redundant to have so many children named in the story when only one of them was fleshed out.As far as conclusions go, it was okay. I'll keep it vague to avoid spoilers, but there was never really a climax. The most exciting parts of the book were around halfway through, with the last 20% jotting along at a steady pace. Maybe I hyped this book up too much for myself, but I expected it to go out with a bang, and while there kind of was one, it just made me think, ""Oh...that wasn't as satisfying as I'd hoped it would be.""  I wanted to be inside Thurman's head when Silo 1 blew. I wanted to know exactly what went through his head as he shot Donald and watched him aim the gun at the bomb. The book also felt too long. The first third was very slow and a lot of it seemed unnecessary.Maybe I'm being a little harsh, because it wasn't by all means a bad book. It deserves to be read, and as a whole, the Silo saga is one of the best book series' I've read, and certainly some of the best dystopian fiction out there. I'm excited to read more of Hugh Howey's work.SPOILERS: Things I'd like cleared up:What's the deal with the other silos?! There are now a bunch of silos with IT heads that have no one to report to. If they don't change their ways, what happens to them after the remaining 200 years are up?If the argon supply was coming from Silo 1, what happens now?

The Twelve;Justin Cronin;2012;2010;592;4.03;101980;yes;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Vampires', 'Dystopia'];In his internationally bestselling and critically acclaimed novel The Passage, Justin Cronin constructed an unforgettable world transformed by a government experiment gone horribly wrong. Now the scope widens and the intensity deepens as the epic story surges forward with The Twelve. In the present day, as the man-made apocalypse unfolds, three strangers navigate the chaos. Lila, a doctor and an expectant mother, is so shattered by the spread of violence and infection that she continues to plan for her child’s arrival even as society dissolves around her. Kittridge, known to the world as “Last Stand in Denver,” has been forced to flee his stronghold and is now on the road, dodging the infected, armed but alone and well aware that a tank of gas will get him only so far. April is a teenager fighting to guide her little brother safely through a landscape of death and ruin. These three will learn that they have not been fully abandoned—and that in connection lies hope, even on the darkest of nights. One hundred years in the future, Amy and the others fight on for humankind’s salvation...unaware that the rules have changed. The enemy has evolved, and a dark new order has arisen with a vision of the future infinitely more horrifying than man’s extinction. If the Twelve are to fall, one of those united to vanquish them will have to pay the ultimate price.;Twelve can be a very unlucky numberQuicker than the first horrorMore action, twists, and active apocalypse make the second part more dynamic and the descriptions and focus on characterization are not as detailed as in the first part, as the conception switches from the protagonists to a plot- character hybrid. Many apocalyptic body horror dark science fantasy ideasGoosebumps are guaranteed, as there are some great shockers, including elements of disgust and close to anything humankind can do to make life as horrible as possible for others, using the popular trope of who the real monsters are. Especially the Sci-Fi elements make this horror hybrid unique, as there is always the question of if just a simple jumpscare or a metaplot twist around the evolution of the dark forces may wait lurking around the next corner.Don´t forget the meta contextThe story is a dark hero´s journey, a walk through hell instead of through fairylands, always reflecting on the sociological impacts of terrible events. Recombine the horror tropes with imagination and a creative writing degreeOne would think that there are some genres that can´t be told in unique ways the thousandth time, but as this example shows, it´s easily possible. At least as long the writer has a creative writing degree, makes an immense effort to write and finetune such a thing, and mixes new, fresh combinations of tropes just as the scientists creating the virus.Maybe even a bit too big and complex The only, but pretty big, problem might be that it´s too epic, complicated, and has too many characters and plotlines and that might be too much for readers who just want to have fun and not invest time in regularly remembering and memorizing. Especially if not reading it (or let´s say the whole series of 3 books) in a relatively short time or having a very good memory. It might have been better to simplify a bit or use more one time character scenes instead of overachieving so much that even I, a friend of complex and multi k page fantasy and sci-fi series, had my problems recapitulating what is just going on. A bit of author ego overkill may be another logical reason, a consequence of flexing too much of the lyrical muscles and unwittingly damaging the work a bit that way.Objectivity is always such a thingBut all the complexity could have had its legitimation, as the third part is said to be the best of the trilogy and maybe my criticism was unfair and it was all just necessary preparation for the final culmination.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13281368-the-twelve

But get this, for the first time in the series, we finally have an entire book with POV chapters told exclusively through the eyes of these four characters. Let me repeat that, Holden, Naomi, Alex, and Amos have their own POV chapters. And to make things even better, Fred, Bobbie, and Avasarala (Yesss!!!) have more spotlight here, and my god, this book/series is seriously so much better for it.

“There was a button,"" Holden said. ""I pushed it.""""Jesus Christ. That really is how you go through life, isn't it?” 

I mean, with that kind of attitude, it’s not a surprise that Holden and the crew of Rocinante always get in trouble. Look, I can’t tell you how pleased I am by Corey’s decision to put all of these characters in one volume. The average ratings speak for itself already; all of these characters are the majority of The Expanse reader’s favorite characters in the series, and of course, Nemesis Games automatically became one of the highest rated books within the series because of this. I’ve mentioned in my review of Abaddon’s Gate and Cibola Burn that I had some issue with the choices of new POV characters. I’ve been waiting for the rest of the crew of Rocinante to have their own POV chapters, and it finally happened here. 

 “This is as good as it gets. Can’t expect everyone to be on the same page. We’re still humans after all. Some percentage of us are always going to be assholes.” 

Not only that, but I think Nemesis Games also managed to highlight Corey’s strength in characterizations for the crew of Rocinante. Even though they’re the four main POV characters of the book, for almost the entirety of the novel, none of them actually share many scenes together. However, just because the characters aren’t separated, it doesn’t mean that the massive intergalactic problem they’re facing isn’t the same; they’re all in this together, their vacation from each other actually strengthen their relationship with each other further as they respectively realized the importance of each individual in their lives. Characterizations and choices of POV characters aside, the intergalactic conflicts introduced in this volume was bloody crazy. There were so many destructions caused and blood being shed; I’m not kidding, the number of casualties exceeded millions. For some reason, I never expected the troubles the characters faced would escalate this much in one volume, and I’m so delighted by it.

 “Looking back through history, there are a lot more men who thought they were Alexander the Great than men who actually were.” 

Intimate storytelling, large-scale conflicts, exciting storyline, and paced incredibly well; Nemesis Games is my favorite entry in the series so far. I have no idea how the second half of the series will go, but I sincerely hope they’ll be as good—or maybe even better—as this because I loved what I’ve read here. Also, I have a feeling the TV series adaptation of this book will be super awesome; maybe it’s time for me to start watching the TV show again.P.S:I’ve read the novella, The Churn, before reading this, and it was beneficial in enriching one of the character’s background.You can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons on Patreon for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Devin, Hamad, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Zoe.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22886612-nemesis-games
Wither;Lauren DeStefano;2011;2010;358;3.8;100348;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Teen'];By age sixteen, Rhine Ellery has four years left to live. She can thank modern science for this genetic time bomb. A botched effort to create a perfect race has left all males with a lifespan of 25 years, and females with a lifespan of 20 years. Geneticists are seeking a miracle antidote to restore the human race, desperate orphans crowd the population, crime and poverty have skyrocketed, and young girls are being kidnapped and sold as polygamous brides to bear more children. When Rhine is kidnapped and sold as a bride, she vows to do all she can to escape. Her husband, Linden, is hopelessly in love with her, and Rhine can't bring herself to hate him as much as she'd like to. He opens her to a magical world of wealth and illusion she never thought existed, and it almost makes it possible to ignore the clock ticking away her short life. But Rhine quickly learns that not everything in her new husband's strange world is what it seems. Her father-in-law, an eccentric doctor bent on finding the antidote, is hoarding corpses in the basement. Her fellow sister wives are to be trusted one day and feared the next, and Rhine is desperate to communicate to her twin brother that she is safe and alive. Will Rhine be able to escape--before her time runs out?Together with one of Linden's servants, Gabriel, Rhine attempts to escape just before her seventeenth birthday. But in a world that continues to spiral into anarchy, is there any hope for freedom?;"As seen on The ReadventurerOh boy, do I have problems with this new crop of YA dystopian/post-apocalyptic lit! I am starting to think that the authors who attempt to explore this genre have no understanding of what it takes to write such books. Just making up some new horrible way people are treated in a future society and adding in some angsty love triangle isn't enough! I don't want to sound too lectur-y, but these new, young writers probably do not realize that to create a dystopian/post-apocalyptic society that is believable, they need to: 1) understand how our current world works; 2) be able to identify cultural, political, economical trends that can possibly affect humanity in a major way in future; 3) realize that when they set their eyes on extrapolating a certain trend, they need to have their characters react to it in a logical (in terms of human psychology) way.Let's take Wither. About 70 year prior to the beginning of the story, humanity got itself into a huge bind. Playing with genetic engineering, scientists created a new, improved type of people, cured of decease, with longer lives, etc. Only the offsprings of these new people have some side effects - females now die at the age of 20 and males - of 25 (this number thing is weird, but ok, I am not going to linger on it). What happens now is that young girls are kidnapped and sold into polygamous marriage to procreate. The main character of this novel, 16-year old Rhine, is now one of 4 wives and is scared for her future...You know what my problem is, right here? The notion that barely out of teen years young men would be so preoccupied with procreation. Why would they care to make babies? They will be dead in a couple of years! Why would anyone in this world care to have children or place a value on them if they never see them grow, if they never were raised by their own parents? Such a strong pro-procreation scheme requires a lot of conditioning IMO, some structure that makes young people accept the idea they need to waste their precious years on being pregnant and producing children. You need some older people to think-up and maintain the procreation cycle, because mostly older people care about this sort of thing. Throw a couple of dozen of teens on an island, tell them they only have four years to live and see how many will think about the next generation. There are some ""first generation"" people around in this novel, who can live their lives until old age, but I never found them very influential in this world DeStefano created. More often than not they are domestics, and not evil masterminds.Then the whole structure of this world is just unbelievable. Why do these people want to give birth to children when there is nobody to take care of them and so many of them run wild? Why do they kill young girls if they are so valuable as wombs? Who actually makes these young people work if they know they are about to die? What motivates them to go to work? None of these questions were answered convincingly to me.The entire dystopian/post-apocalyptic premise is faulty in my mind. My rant here only pertains to a fraction of issues I have with it. There are great reviews, like this one that explore holes in the world building in terms of economics, politics, etc. You might think I am too nit-picky, question everything, but I just read Paolo Bacigalupi's short story ""The People of Sand and Slag"" in which people eat sand, regrow their limbs and embellish their bones with blades and I totally bought it! When written right, any, even the most outrageous premise, can make you believe in it.I am sure there will be some people taken by Wither. They will like being shocked/disgusted/titillated by the scenes of polygamy, the main character's constant fear of being raped and impregnated, 13-year old girl having sex with her much older husband (and liking it), mentions of Kama Sutra, etc. I personally found some aspects of this novel distasteful. Instead of Wither I would recommend The Handmaid's Tale and The Children of Men which deal with similar themes, but in a more responsible and sophisticated way.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8525590-wither
Never Fade;Alexandra Bracken;2013;2010;507;4.2;100017;yes;['Dystopia', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fiction', 'Paranormal'];Ruby never asked for the abilities that almost cost her her life. Now she must call upon them on a daily basis, leading dangerous missions to bring down a corrupt government and breaking into the minds of her enemies. Other kids in the Children’s League call Ruby “Leader”, but she knows what she really is: a monster. When Ruby is entrusted with an explosive secret, she must embark on her most dangerous mission yet: leaving the Children’s League behind. Crucial information about the disease that killed most of America’s children—and turned Ruby and the others who lived into feared and hated outcasts—has survived every attempt to destroy it. But the truth is only saved in one place: a flashdrive in the hands of Liam Stewart, the boy Ruby once believed was her future—and who now wouldn’t recognize her. As Ruby sets out across a desperate, lawless country to find Liam—and answers about the catastrophe that has ripped both her life and America apart—she is torn between old friends and the promise she made to serve the League. Ruby will do anything to protect the people she loves. But what if winning the war means losing herself?;I liked this so much more than the first book!

We Are Legion;Dennis E. Taylor;2016;2010;383;4.28;99371;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy', 'Humor', 'Space'];Alternate Cover Edition can be found here. Bob Johansson has just sold his software company and is looking forward to a life of leisure. There are places to go, books to read, and movies to watch. So it's a little unfair when he gets himself killed crossing the street.  Bob wakes up a century later to find that corpsicles have been declared to be without rights, and he is now the property of the state. He has been uploaded into computer hardware and is slated to be the controlling AI in an interstellar probe looking for habitable planets. The stakes are high: no less than the first claim to entire worlds. If he declines the honor, he'll be switched off, and they'll try again with someone else. If he accepts, he becomes a prime target. There are at least three other countries trying to get their own probes launched first, and they play dirty.  The safest place for Bob is in space, heading away from Earth at top speed. Or so he thinks. Because the universe is full of nasties, and trespassers make them mad - very mad.;This is one of these novels that make people ask themselves why nobody before had this magnificent idea. All fragments and ideas were there, they just had to be put together to create such a great story, heck even a series.  First person perspective expanding I have seen this setting in many Sci-Fi novels, but never as the driving force for a series. It must be extremely difficult to write a novel out of such a confining perspective and still integrate so much suspension and wit into it. It certainly helps that the Bobs can multiply and that the worldbuilding and technobabble take some room in the opening novel.  Avoid unnecessary dying This way of immortality always leads me to the question of why people tend to believe that death has to be an integral part of society as if funerals were great fun and stinking corpses roses. There is a great video about this topichttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25qz...and as always it seems as if the stupidity and inherent evil of ideology, economy, and faith leads people to the belief that it is so desirable to suffer and die.  Social solipsism makes decisions easyIt´s also unique because the main protagonist stumbles in a plethora of Sci-Fi settings that are usually solved by a larger group of individuals or with a strict plot order, not just one person with the possibility to decide nearly anything alone. So all the settings for philosophical, ethical, political,... implications pop up and open room for homages and, and that´s the trigger in this novel, new ideas!  Mind uploading. No backup, no compassionIt shows the immense potential of the Sci-Fi tropes about mind uploading and thereby induced immortality and personality splitting/cloning, and especially the possibility of mind uploading for thousands of years of space travel, which might probably be the first option. Because it might take much longer, hopefully not forever, to get physical immortality without resident eviling the world population. Who mumbles impossible back on the cheap seats? But it´s not and will not be forever, all just a question of time. To be a part of a hive mind, an entity or a Gaia superorganism, to be a single entity, or used by evil forces, all of these options are better than to vanish forever. Living happily ever after forever with all loved ones could be an option too, but a terribly boring topic for a book without all the escalation options it offers too.

But Holly is no typical teenage runaway: a sensitive child once contacted by voices she knew only as “the radio people,” Holly is a lightning rod for psychic phenomena. Now, as she wanders deeper into the English countryside, visions and coincidences reorder her reality until they assume the aura of a nightmare brought to life.For Holly has caught the attention of a cabal of dangerous mystics—and their enemies. But her lost weekend is merely the prelude to a shocking disappearance that leaves her family irrevocably scarred. This unsolved mystery will echo through every decade of Holly’s life, affecting all the people Holly loves—even the ones who are not yet born.A Cambridge scholarship boy grooming himself for wealth and influence, a conflicted father who feels alive only while reporting from occupied Iraq, a middle-aged writer mourning his exile from the bestseller list—all have a part to play in this surreal, invisible war on the margins of our world. From the medieval Swiss Alps to the nineteenth-century Australian bush, from a hotel in Shanghai to a Manhattan townhouse in the near future, their stories come together in moments of everyday grace and extraordinary wonder.;"[UPDATE 10.16] Here is the review that this book deserves: please read  this and not mine. My review is not worth reading. -----------------------------------I'm such a drama queen. This is all planned out: I imagined a ceremonious return to goodreads, where I shock the masses with a derisive and scathing critique of one of my favorite authors, and the goodreads community would all be astir. ""What happened to him?"" ""Didn't he just love David Mitchell?"" ""He wouldn't shut up about him!"" And then the marauding hordes would rise out of the woodworks, tear me from my home, and tie me to the stake, set those sticks ablaze, crying, ""Traitor! Traitor! What hath the apostate said about the lord our Mitchell? Blasphemy!"" And I'd look fierce and proud, dying a martyr for the cause. What vanity! Who was it, David Foster Wallace, that said people don't think about you nearly as much as you think other people think about you? The interesting thing is that David Mitchell, in many ways, has already reviewed his own book. Turn your hymnals to page 291: ""In my salad days at Cambridge, I got into a fistfight defending the honor of Hershey's early masterpiece Desiccated Embryos  and to this day I wear the scar on my ear as a badge of honor . . . To dub  Echo Must Die  'Infantile, flatulent, ghastly drivel; would be an insult to infants, to flatulence, and to ghosts alike. . . So why is Echo Must Die  such a decomposing hog? One: Hershey is so bent on avoiding cliché that each sentence is as tortured as an American whistleblower. Two: The fantasy subplot clashes so violently with the book's State of the World pretensions, I cannot bear to look. Three: What Surer sign is there that the creative aquifers are dry that a writer creating a writer-character?"" I wouldn't go as far as that, but Mitchell's fictionalized critic has a point. Self-referential self-deprecation is so passé, so 2004. What is this Cloud Atlas? It's true, the fantasy plot in Bone Clocks is crammed into the other stories, and it is such a jarring shift in tone that it derails the novel; it threw me out of reality that Mitchell tries so hard to create. And it's mostly due to the fact that fantasy novels insist upon its own language, invented words, self-serious monologuing, and exposition-dumping, all of which is difficult enough to stomach in a strict fantasy novel, let alone a novel that wants to be every genre. (And that's not a bad thing in my book. It's what has made Mitchell the writer he is, but it's seems too difficult to throw fantasy into the genre juggling circle.) Furthermore, the fantasy ""sub-plot"" is actually the main plot in Bone Clocks. However, this plot is dropped for almost 50 pages at a time. The writing, while certainly lovely, feels aimless through most of the novel. We meander through large passages of beautiful prose that detail the lives of sad, sexually-frustrated males, only to find our way back to a strange and ham-fisted fantasy plot. And several times, Mitchell touches on the plot through some serendipitous event that demands explanation, which the characters (ignorant of the grander scheme behind it all) can not make sense of. It's all awash in semi-mystical, new age metaphysics, Murakami at his worst. When the plot lands and Mitchell does explain the mechanism behind the mysteries, we're a good 450 pages into the novel. There were such large stretches of text that persisted without explanation that I failed to find it interesting, important, or significant.Don't get me wrong, this is still D. Mitch, and the dude can turn a phrase like it's no one's business, but the structure does more to inhibit the novel's enjoyment that it does to enhance the writing. The book's far too uneven or consistent to have taken off, and maybe this is what is was like to not enjoy Cloud Atlas and that seems fair to me now. I'll just go reread Number9Dream and wax nostalgic about the good ole' days when I could worship unquestionably at the feet of my idols. Maybe then those damn kids will get off my lawn.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20819685-the-bone-clocks

The Age of Miracles;Karen Thompson Walker;2012;2010;294;3.66;93087;no;['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Coming Of Age', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];"“It’s never the disasters you see coming that finally come to pass—it’s the ones you don’t expect at all,” says Julia, in this spellbinding novel of catastrophe and survival by a superb new writer. Luminous, suspenseful, unforgettable, The Age of Miracles tells the haunting and beautiful story of Julia and her family as they struggle to live in a time of extraordinary change.   On an ordinary Saturday in a California suburb, Julia awakens to discover that something has happened to the rotation of the earth. The days and nights are growing longer and longer; gravity is affected; the birds, the tides, human behavior, and cosmic rhythms are thrown into disarray. In a world that seems filled with danger and loss, Julia also must face surprising developments in herself, and in her personal world: divisions widening between her parents; strange behavior by her friends; the pain and vulnerability of first love; a growing sense of isolation; and a surprising, rebellious new strength. With crystalline prose and the indelible magic of a born storyteller, Karen Thompson Walker paints a breathtaking portrait of people finding ways to go on in an ever-evolving world.";"I loved this book. I read it in one 24 hour period. Great example of soft sci-fi/fabulist fiction. It's like a cross between Alice Sebold's book The Lovely Bones and Lars Van Trier's film Melancholia. In some ways, I also thought about Diary of Anne Frank. A young girl faces a possible apocalypse in MIRACLES. It's YA dystopia but more charming and whimsical than, say, The Hunger Games. Ultimately it is a book that celebrates life with one hand, as it erases life with the other.The language of the book is poetic and intoxicating. The consequences of the slowing earth are imagined in rich and provocative detail. I'm a very picky reader and many unfinished books lie around my house, but this one satisfied me. (I was less taken with the second book, The Dreamers. The review is also on Goodreads.) The YA heroine in Miracles was someone I could relate to and root for, the plot had just enough twists, the concept hooked me and was well executed.SPOILER ALERT. I did think the author cheated just a bit here and there. It's a brilliant cheat. There are times the hero Julia says things like: ""That was the last time I EVER ate strawberries."" Or I NEVER saw so and so again. That kind of language hints that she might die at the end, or that the world ends in the last chapter. In fact, the character and the world still go on by the novel's end, albeit precariously. I think the more honest phrasing would have been: ""That was the last time I ate strawberries this spring."" Because as long as the earth spins and she is alive, she can't truly know that she will NEVER eat strawberries again. Even if strawberries become extinct, technically she can not know that by some twist of fate she won't eat them again. It's a small thing and I think the author was very clever to use this sleight of hand. It made me think that the girl or the world were going away. It's a book I will think of for some time. As a writer myself of speculative, trippy fiction -- I am in the process of analyzing the many things this book did right! * Thanks to the many goodreads folks who have liked this review.

Sleeping Giants;Sylvain Neuvel;2016;2010;320;3.82;92635;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Mystery', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];A girl named Rose is riding her new bike near home in Deadwood, South Dakota, when she falls through the earth. She wakes up at the bottom of a square-shaped hole, its walls glowing with intricate carvings. But the firemen who come to save her peer down upon something even stranger: a little girl in the palm of a giant metal hand.Seventeen years later, the mystery of the bizarre artifact remains unsolved - the object's origins, architects, and purpose unknown.But some can never stop searching for answers.Rose Franklin is now a highly trained physicist leading a top-secret team to crack the hand's code. And along with her colleagues, she is being interviewed by a nameless interrogator whose power and purview are as enigmatic as the relic they seek. What's clear is that Rose and her compatriots are on the edge of unravelling history's most perplexing discovery-and finally figuring out what it portends for humanity. But once the pieces of the puzzle are in place, will the result be an instrument of lasting peace or a weapon of mass destruction?;"You have to understand that this flies in the face of everything we know about American civilizations.
Sleeping Giants is being compared to the bestseller and now successful Matt Damon film - The Martian - which is misleading, if not entirely inaccurate. The two books' stories, narrative styles, characters and overall tones are actually very different. Almost all the details about this book do not resemble The Martian at all. However, they do share a key similarity. For me, The Martian is not a great book because of the humour, detailed science, or its focus on survival against the odds - it's a great book because it makes you feel tiny. It's a breathtakingly extraordinary concept that we are forced to imagine: being stranded hundreds of thousands of miles away from anyone else. Trapped on a distant planet where pretty much everything can kill you. Putting myself in Mark Watney's shoes was overwhelming, feeling all alone in the vast expanse of space. Having no clue how this situation could possibly end in survival.Sleeping Giants gave me a similar feeling. A feeling of wide-eyed wonder at the suggestion of this possibility: the discovery of giant metal body parts deep underground; giant body parts that predate the human technology necessary to create them. The implication being - if humans couldn't possibly have made this giant, who did?The story is told through a series of interviews with a nameless interviewer, as well as the occasional journal entry and news article. Unlike The Martian, this isn't propelled by a single character's humourous narrative, but instead allows us a look at all the people involved in this project - in uncovering the body parts, finding out how they work, what it all means, and trying to keep their sanity as the world becomes more and more insane.
What I am is very much a function of what I am not. If the “other” is the Muslim world, then I am the Judeo-Christian world. If the other is from thousands of light-years away, I am simply human. Redefine alterity and you can erase boundaries.
We see how this discovery and the subsequent revelations affect the world. Imagine what this means for humanity. It is the suggestion that we are not alone and are not the most advanced creatures in the universe. What were these giant body parts created for? Are they a message or a weapon? What does this mean for religions? Is someone out there waiting for us?It is perhaps not as ""warm"" a sci-fi novel as The Martian. It feels darker, more frightening, giving us less reason to believe the author owes us a happy ending. The ending is haunting and unexpected, paving the way for a sequel that should be equally thought-provoking. I, for one, really want to know what happens next.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733990-sleeping-giants
Wilder Girls;Rory Power;2019;2010;357;3.46;91749;yes;['Horror', 'Young Adult', 'LGBT', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Queer', 'Science Fiction'];It's been eighteen months since the Raxter School for Girls was put under quarantine. Since the Tox hit and pulled Hetty's life out from under her.It started slow. First the teachers died one by one. Then it began to infect the students, turning their bodies strange and foreign. Now, cut off from the rest of the world and left to fend for themselves on their island home, the girls don't dare wander outside the school's fence, where the Tox has made the woods wild and dangerous. They wait for the cure they were promised as the Tox seeps into everything.But when Byatt goes missing, Hetty will do anything to find her, even if it means breaking quarantine and braving the horrors that lie beyond the fence. And when she does, Hetty learns that there's more to their story, to their life at Raxter, than she could have ever thought true.;"I want it . I got it . I hate it. Like I am so disappointed and frustrated because I expected it to be good but it was nothing like really nothing. I didn't get anything while reading it. The cover is gorgeous and the synopsis is incredibly interesting as fuck ! But the book boring and it's not a retelling of lord of flies like it's advertised I guess it's more like inspired from it! Plot ✒The story took place in an all girl's boarding school called Raxter situated on a island not far from mainland . The school is put under quarantine by USA navy due to outbreak of toxwhich is a parasite which mutated the girls and the teachers to the point that some of them died because of that and the others are not allowed to leave the school due to wild animals which are also mutated and only a pack of three girls are allowed to go out to bring food and stuff. Now the follows as to what happens when one of the character Byatt goes missing and her best friend Hetty will do everything to save her??✒I liked the atmosphere , separation from outer world .I loved the idea of tox and the wild stuff but the the idea wasn't Anywhere exciting or anywhere new for me.✒Survival was key aspect and I really missed it.There wasn't much focus on it.✒I loved the idea of body horror in the book like Hetty has an eyelid shut and a kind of flowering is growing behind it and then Byatt has a second spine and Reese has a silver metal claw, it was quite gross and disturbing but that was the point I guess.✒F-F romance which wasn't the main plot of the book but I think it was selling point for most of the people but it didn't worked for me at all because of the fact that it came out of no where.Characters The book is more character driven than plot driven but at the same time I didn't connected with any of them. I believe that if we get into characters head and thoughts and still don't get their personalities then it's a shame.The characters in this book were flat to the point that , I don't care about them . They made some of the illogical and stupid decisions that idk, I feel like the book overall had no effect on me .Writing The writing style was one of the off points for me like it was kinda choppy, weird, unique,edgy and erratic but I believe she used it intentionally to reflect the chaotic nature of the island but it didn't worked for me. It was like thoughts upon thoughts like stream of conscious feelings and it was so boring that it to keep my attention .Ending I am like so frustrated , the book built up to the point where things were quite interesting , like I was excited for then to go out of the island. But that ending it came out if nowhere , like there were a million loose threads. It was super abrupt and distorted in all aspects like what happened to other girls? What is tox and it's explanation? Where it came from? I wanted author to go more into like a deep analysis of the tox and where it came from like the scientific aspects I was really looking forward to it but all my hopes and expectations weren't fullfilled or to be precise none of my expectations were fullfilled?For those who haven't read the book , the ending was frustrating and disappointing for me.The book is kinda polarising like either you will love it or didn't like it, there is no half way between ! And I in general didn't liked it .Like whole time I was reading it I was wishing ""Man this is so boring wish I was watching annihilation or fortitude right now"" like it gave me same vibes.Well I would recommend this book to people , because there are many 5 star reviews , you might like it but it didn't work for me..";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42505366-wilder-girls

Working with a distrustful but desperate team, a series of frustrating interrogations, a cache of hidden notes, and hours of profoundly troubling video footage, Control begins to penetrate the secrets of Area X. But with each discovery he must confront disturbing truths about himself and the agency he's pledged to serve.In Authority, the second volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, Area X's most disturbing questions are answered . . . but the answers are far from reassuring.";I can't give this more than 2 stars because the center of the book drags along like a sacked brick. I tried and tried to get into it, but I couldn't remain interested.It just doesn't need 200 pages to get across the idea of the Southern Reach. Relationships barely develop past the first meetings and the whole thing feels stuck. I guess this mirrors the feelings the main characters are supposed to be experiencing in the least fun way possible.None of the little mysteries really go anywhere exciting, and the good stuff that happens is pretty random and not driven at all by the events that precede it. The main event near the end of the book could have just happened on page 50 and spared us the main part of the book.Maybe I'm being harsh! There is another book on its way after all. It could all slot together and be a satisfying adventure story - but my interest is pretty dented.Annihilation, was a fun, really short, little mystery that flew along. This book is work, and you don't get much in return. (yet?);https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077769-authority
Monsters of Men;Patrick Ness;2010;2010;643;4.22;87287;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Romance'];As a world-ending war surges to life around them, Todd and Viola face monstrous decisions. The indigenous Spackle, thinking and acting as one, have mobilized to avenge their murdered people. Ruthless human leaders prepare to defend their factions at all costs, even as a convoy of new settlers approaches. And as the ceaseless Noise lays all thoughts bare, the projected will of the few threatens to overwhelm the desperate desire of the many. The consequences of each action, each word, are unspeakably vast: To follow a tyrant or a terrorist? To save the life of the one you love most or thousands of strangers? To believe in redemption or assume it is lost? Becoming adults amid the turmoil, Todd and Viola question all they have known, racing through horror and outrage toward a shocking finale.;"I am shocked. I am speechless. I don't even think I can do this book justice by writing this review. My first reaction is just to scream ""OH MY EFFING GOD!!!"" (only I don't say ""effing""! heh heh … Well, if you've read the books you get the joke) … which is exactly what I said about fifty times after I finished reading it last night.Seriously, it isn't often that a book like this comes along. I don't think a book has left me feeling this shocked and amazed in years––not even the first two books, which also totally blew my mind.All right, well, let's get down to business. I should stop ranting and get to reviewing.So, Monsters of Men is the third book in Patrick Ness's amazingamazingamazing trilogy, Chaos Walking. As I already said, the first two books––The Knife of Never Letting Go and The Ask and the Answer––absolutely blew me away, so I had very high expectations for the final chapter. Of course, when you have high expectations, you get nervous, too. I didn't know how on earth Ness was going to end this or what he was going to do with it … but I trusted him to write something incredible. And ohmygoodness he totally exceeded those very high expectations.Ha, so, funny story about this book. It came out in the UK in early May, and it is not scheduled to come out in the United States until late September. I was just about to explode with impatience, and I totally would have died if I'd had to wait that long. Fortunately someone told me about this website, The Book Depository, which allows you to order books from other countries with free shipping. (YESSSS!!!) So I ordered it and it came for me in the mail yesterday (after my last day of school, too! talk about the best day ever!) and I pretty much read it nonstop from 3:30 to 11:30. I even took it to my sister's middle-school graduation and read it standing up, because I could not bear to put it down. Teehee.So, anyway. The book. I do not even know where to begin. AL;KDFJSJF;SJKFD. Yeah, that's about all I have to say. Just kidding. But really, I'm trying to find the words to write this.Basically, these books are emotionally exhausting. I don't know how else to put it. You become so attached to Todd and Viola and you see them go through so much terrifying crap and it's just like … aaahhh … It gives you that total feeling of dread that eats away at the inside of your stomach, and your eyes are glued to the page and it's like ""HOLY CRAP! What if one of them dies or both of them dies or AGGGH??!!! NO NO NO PATRICK NESS WOULDN'T DO THAT … Oh wait, he totally would. CRAP!"" I was hardly breathing the whole time I was reading this. And at the end my heart was literally pounding because I was so shocked and so terrified and so devastated and so amazed and I had tears in my eyes and I was about to scream at the book and … GAH. Trust me, it takes a LOT for a book to affect me like this. Okay, I am hyperventilating all over again, just thinking about it. Moving on.So, Todd and Viola. Let's talk about them, because I love them like they were actual people. Firstly Todd … He has been our beloved narrator since book one––he's a sweetheart, he's funny, he's honest, he's confused, he's completely believable … And in Monsters of Men I loved him more than ever. He is definitely one of my favorite main characters of all time. I totally felt for him in this one, and it was heartbreaking to see how he gets caught up in the horrors of war … yet, his dedication to Viola keeps him from completely losing himself. (Awwww <3) And Viola is totally awesome too––strong and determined, and just as dedicated to Todd as he is to her. (AWWWWW! I'm gonna make myself cry. *sniffles*) Their adorable relationship really drives the plot along. Just about everything Todd and Viola do, they do for each other. Although the story is dark, disturbing, and violent, at its heart it is ultimately a story about how love triumphs over war.Patrick Ness. Let's talk about him now, because he actually IS a real person, and in my opinion he is a writing GOD. I know that a lot of people turn away from this series complaining that the writing gives them a headache. (Poopies on them. GRRR. Wait, what? I didn't say that.) And what these people don't recognize is something called originality, which I dare to say most authors lack these days. So, yes, Patrick Ness does write in a stream-of-consciousness style––one-sentence paragraphs, paragraphs that break off in the middle, occasionally spelling words phonetically, switching perspectives every two pages … And yeah, it takes a while to get used to it. I didn't like the first book when I started it, but after about 100 pages or so I got hooked, and I have been addicted to this series ever since. Part of its true power is in Ness's writing. Although it's not the typical ""good"" writing style, meaning it defies quite a few grammar rules, it is truly amazing writing. There's a difference between being a bad writer and making a choice to not write in a typical style. In this case, it's the latter, and it pays off. Patrick Ness writes in a concise manner––carefully choosing words and images so that each one is meaningful and sticks permanently in the reader's head. His writing is raw, emotional, and completely haunting. And it manages to do this while still being very subtle––that is, Ness doesn't have to outright say things to make them obvious, and that somehow makes them more powerful. I don't know how else to explain it, but you have to read it to see what I mean. I tried to do some writing last night after I finished reading and I just couldn't because I felt like I'd been put to shame! I'm not saying I want to steal his style, but I can only hope that I will find a writing style of my own that will affect someone as powerfully as his has affected and inspired me. :)This book is truly, truly amazing. It's a fascinating exploration of human nature and every aspect of it––how we make war when we want peace, how violence destroys us and how love heals us, how we mature from girls and boys to women and men, how love influences the choices we make … I could go on and on. But over all, these books are astounding, compelling, heartbreaking, touching, terrifying, and haunting. This is by far one of the best books and one of the best series I have ever read in my entire life, and if you have not read them you are missing out on an amazing story. GO READ THEM NOW.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20758105-monsters-of-men
Babylon’s Ashes;James S.A. Corey;2016;2010;532;4.25;85415;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy'];"The sixth book in the New York Times bestselling Expanse series. 



NOW A MAJOR TV SERIES
A revolution brewing for generations has begun in fire. It will end in blood.The Free Navy - a violent group of Belters in black-market military ships - has crippled the Earth and begun a campaign of piracy and violence among the outer planets. The colony ships heading for the thousand new worlds on the far side of the alien ring gates are easy prey, and no single navy remains strong enough to protect them.James Holden and his crew know the strengths and weaknesses of this new force better than anyone. Outnumbered and outgunned, the embattled remnants of the old political powers call on the Rocinante for a desperate mission to reach Medina Station at the heart of the gate network. But the new alliances are as flawed as the old, and the struggle for power has only just begun. As the chaos grows, an alien mystery deepens. Pirate fleets, mutiny and betrayal may be the least of the Rocinante's problems. And in the uncanny spaces past the ring gates, the choices of a few damaged and desperate people may determine the fate of more than just humanity.";"3.5/5 starsA good sequel that feels like a long wrap-up to Nemesis Games.Babylon’s Ashes is the sixth book in The Expanse series. The story picked up immediately from where Nemesis Games ended, and that’s pretty much what this book is about. Babylon’s Ashes is a long-wrap up to Nemesis Games, and I did feel that almost half of the content in this book could’ve been cut out and put into Nemesis Games instead. I get it, it’s difficult to write a follow-up to Nemesis Games, that book was insane space-opera with actions, stakes, and characterizations at an all-time high for the series. However, for a series that’s now six books long, I must say that the story hasn’t progressed as much as I thought it would. This isn’t me complaining that Babylon’s Ashes wasn’t necessary, but I won’t lie, the pacing of the first half of this novel was painfully slow; the reason behind this is the number of new and random POV characters that I’m forced to read.

“I thought if you told people facts, they'd draw their conclusions, and because the facts were true, the conclusions mostly would be too. But we don't run on facts. We run on stories about things. About people.” 

I’ve said it before, I don’t like the choices Corey took to keep on including new POV characters within each book instead of just following the already established and solid main characters. This is one of the things that has magnificently been fixed in the TV series. And to be fair, most of the new characters outside of the crew of Rocinante that Corey has included throughout the series so far has been great or at least tolerable. But in here, there were so many random side characters POV who didn’t seem to bring anything to the story except to slow down the pacing immensely. I love the crew of Rocinante; if I’m given a choice to do one significant change to the narrative decision in the series, it would be to rewrite the entire series and tell them solely from the crew of Rocinante’s perspectives. Seriously, Holden, Naomi, Amos, Alex, Bobbie, and especially Avasarala were by far the best characters of the series. Now, these favorite characters of mine did play a lot of parts here, and after the extra boost to characterizations done for them in Nemesis Games, their role and appearances only seem to get better and better.

“You use a welding rig to weld things. You use a gun to shoot things. You use a Bobbie Draper to fuck a bunch of bad guys permanently up.” 

Their chemistry and relationship between each other in the face of danger and appreciating every small moment of peace were easy to empathize with. Now, does this mean that ALL the new characters were boring? Not really, just the one that appeared only once or twice as POV characters. Filip and Michio Pa as POV characters, though, were engaging and interesting; I’m pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed their chapters in the second half of the book. I’ll have to give Corey a point on that one. 

“History, Michio believed, was a long series of surprises that seemed inevitable in retrospect.” 

Overall, I have a bit of a mixed opinion on Babylon’s Ashes. I would summarize my review on Babylon’s Ashes by concluding that the first half of this novel was a snooze fest, the second half was brilliant. It definitely felt like it could’ve been shortened or maybe even include on Nemesis Games, which would make Nemesis Games even more amazing. The conclusion of the conflict was a bit anti-climactic, but I highly enjoyed reading the last closing chapters. It seemed to me that Babylon’s Ashes has wrapped everything up, if no one told me there was a sequel coming, I would’ve believed this to be the end of the series; not a satisfying one, but it could work. All things said, and I’m not sure I’m mistaken on this or not, but I’ve heard from several people that there’s a huge time skip coming in Persepolis Rising. If that’s true, I’m excited about it; a time skip could be what the series really needs now. As for the villains? I have no idea who or what they’re going to fight next. Probably a return or resurrection of an old enemy or something; that’s usually how it goes.You can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons on Patreon for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Devin, Hamad, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Zoe.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25877663-babylon-s-ashes

The review in it's entirely is below in the spoiler tag. Here are my reasons for the disclaimer:- I knew that this would be controversial as it touches on a hot button topic. But, responses have become uncomfortable to the point I cringe when I open Goodreads. I know, I know, what did I expect sharing a controversial opinion on social media!? Yeah, I admit I guess I should have seen that coming. But, this review simply shares my opinion on a topic I felt was key to the story. Many people agree, many people don't. That is fine! All opinions welcome! I just don't want to fight about it because I have no desire to change anyone's opinion.- I have received negative feedback from both sides of my argument! That's right, I picked a hot button topic and managed to annoy people on both sides (that is pretty impressive). I have been told that I missed the point, I am dense, I have lost respect from people, I think I am better than others, etc. I have been unfriended and unfollowed by many. That was 100% not my intention and I want it to stop. In fact, the point of my opinion is that discussions on this topic drives people apart and causes people to hate each other. So, the fact that my review is only promoting negative behavior (in some cases) is sad to me. 🙁- I am okay with all the 5 star reviews of this book. I am glad many people had a better experience with it than I did. I do not go to the 5 star reviews and try to prove them wrong. Goodreads is all about differing opinions and I embrace that.-You may notice that this review has lots of comments. If you have a criticism of my review, it most likely been discussed ad nauseum so I encourage you to look through the comments first. ""That I missed the point"", ""The book did not say 'All' people of a certain group"", ""Don't you understand what the political climate is in America right now?"", etc. - all have been covered.- At one point in my review I make a bold statement using the number 99%, after the response I have received from both sides, that number is probably more like 75%So, feel free to read the review. I am not trying to change anyone's mind. I am just trying to express my opinion as thoroughly as possible, and if you don't agree that is fine. The point of my review is to help stop hate, hurt, and bias, so I do not want my review to contribute to that in any way.Controversial review time! Grab the popcorn and settle in . . .First of all, many thanks to the Berkley Publishing Group for an advanced reading copy in exchange for an honest review. I am just sorry that my review does not end up being more positive!I think this book is dangerous. I think the ideas in it are inflammatory and will unnecessarily pit good people against each other. If the book has only moderate success, then maybe crisis will be averted. But, if it is embraced, I think there are a lot of misconceptions in it that could be destructive to our society. And, goodness knows that society doesn’t need any help with that right now! I am seeing some positive pre-release reviews, many of which praise the cautionary tale within, and that scares me. It scares me a lot!I love dystopian fiction. This book really made me think about why I love dystopian fiction. The “what-ifs” that drive this genre and the potential evils haunting our current society that could lead to its downfall are fascinating. Corrupt politicians, radical ideals, oppression, crazy religious zealots, diseases, zombies – all are interesting to think about. Sometimes the books are tongue-in-cheek about the cause with caricatures of current leaders or allegories of dangerous political ideals. Also, we frequently see books where the dystopian isn’t even fully explained (I am trying to remember if they even ever tell us why everything happened in the world of the Hunger Games – we know the end result, but I don’t think they ever give us the specifics).So, the fact that this book made me think about why I love dystopian fiction made me realize why I did not like this book and its dangerous message. Usually the causes are hinted at or left to be guessed about (Hunger Games), represented in a thought provoking way (allegories like Animal Farm), or just downright out of our control (disease and zombies). This book just straight up says that Christians and Christianity are to blame. I would like to say that it is just hinted at, or at least it is a combination of events in addition to crazy religious leaders that leads to the horribly oppressive society within. But, the author straight up comes out a blames Christianity, quotes scripture, and repeatedly brings it back to the forefront. And, throughout she does not say it is some Christians, or a few wacko Christians, it is ALL CHRISTIANS and they are more than happy to take over the country and silence Women and send non-straight people to camps where they are forced into heterosexual relationships. At one point she even hints the next step is that anyone who is not white will be oppressed and sent to the camps as well.Whew . . . I need a moment to re-wrap my brain around that and explain a few things . . .I have known a lot of you for several years here on Goodreads and I believe I represent myself as open and fair. I like to read almost any type of book. I have friends on here and in real life who are women, men, gay, straight, black, Asian, Hispanic, etc. I have befriended many people who are agnostic, atheist, Christian, Muslim, etc. I believe all my conversations with everyone are pleasant and I do not try and force who I am on any one – I just share who I am and let others decide how they feel about me.Well, I am a Christian. I do my best to go to church every week and I enjoy reading the bible. I have never met a Christian who wants to oppress people the way they do in this book. We have a variety of races of people who attend our church. I am not sure that I know any gay people who are Christian, and I can see why that might be, but I hold no ill will towards anyone because of their sexual preference or gender status. If anyone wanted to talk to me about Christianity, I would do so with an open and friendly heart and not desire them to be oppressed in any way for not being just like me. I truly believe that 99% of all Christians are like me. In this day and age, it is the controversial Christians who get all the publicity. It’s the keyboard warriors who feel like they should post nasty comments on every internet article and tweet that they consider “Unchristian”. It’s the awful people with hateful signs protesting the funerals of our servicemen. It’s the white supremacist rallies where the “men” hide behind the cross like God agrees with the hate they spew. The internet and media love to focus on hate and people treating each other poorly. If one crazy Christian kills someone it will be remembered much more than a church that raises money and takes donations to feed and clothe 5000 people. I could have been behind this book if it was blamed on a few religious extremists who managed to take over the government; there are definitely religious extremists out there that would love to do that and oppress lots of people – I do not argue that! But, it really isn’t presented as a few bad apples. There are mentions of expanding Christian communities taking over and forcing people to follow their ways. I will say that I can definitely see people having that fear with the way Christians are presented: debates on TV – Creation vs Science, protesters claiming they know who “God Hates”, bad people hiding behind prayers and crosses. But with this book saying it is all Christians and getting reviews from people thinking that it is a cautionary tale worth considering, again, it scares me.I ask you this, and you might say that I am being too extreme here, but how would you respond if the plot of a dystopian book was identical to this but it was an extreme-Christian blaming homosexuals or a extreme-right-winger blaming people who are not white? It would be panned! It would be destroyed by critics and the author trashed on Twitter! As a Christian, this is how this book makes me feel. I mentioned earlier that I have tried my best to be a good person, a reasonable thinker, and a supportive friend to all people I meet – so, should I be okay with it when a book attacks an important part of me and blames it for the potential downfall of society? As a book, it was okay. I probably would have gone 3 stars if it was not for my concerns above. The end felt kind of rushed and convenient – sort of Deus ex Machina (which is ironic since Deus means God!). Up until the last 50 pages or so, the plot development seemed somewhat reasonable and then it just got kind of crazy. Also, I found all the main characters to be unlikable throughout. Sometimes unlikable works when that is the point, but I don't think they were supposed to be unlikable in this context.Maybe the author will read my review and think, “That was not my intention at all”. And, if she does and contacts me I will be happy to discuss it with an open mind and an open heart. I hold her no ill will and I think doing so would be un-Christian of me. If anything, I would like to show her that Christians are reasonable and friendly people – don’t let the few bad apples who get all the screen time cause you to group us together with them.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37796866-vox
The Atlantis Gene;A.G. Riddle;2013;2010;464;3.79;79098;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure'];The greatest mystery of all time...the history of human origins...will be revealed.In Antarctica, researchers discover a mysterious structure, buried in ice.In a lab in Jakarta, an autism researcher identifies a revolutionary treatment that could change everything.But these two incredible discoveries aren't what they seem. They will set off a race to unravel the deepest secrets of human existence--and an event that could change humanity forever.;A good plot badly written. I don't mean to be harsh but that's how it is. The book felt like reading a movie script instead of a novel. The scenes are too rushed at times, and the scenery abruptly changes, too fast (just like present day TV action series), and so many chapters just makes it more cluttered and confusing. Scenes are not clearly explained in my view, and it was very hard to visualize what was going on. The story is a typical sci-fi and has nothing to offer out of the box. It is just a mish mash of everything (evil vs good, nazis, Atlanteans, super human race vs us petty homo-sapiens, a pretty and intelligent female doctor and a strong ex-military male lead, them falling in love together and so on.... The only reason i finished this book is because i usually try not to give up on any books without finishing them, especially when i have paid for them. It was at times a pain to read through it and that is never the case with a good book.I would say, if you value your time, do not read this book. It would make a great movie, but is a bad book in my opinion.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25843420-the-atlantis-gene
The 100;Kass Morgan;2013;2010;323;3.58;78420;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Post Apocalyptic'];No one has set foot on Earth in centuries—until now.Ever since a devastating nuclear war, humanity has lived on spaceships far above Earth's radioactive surface. Now, one hundred juvenile delinquents—considered expendable by society—are being sent on a dangerous mission: to recolonize the planet. It could be their second chance at life...or it could be a suicide mission.CLARKE was arrested for treason, though she's haunted by the memory of what she really did. WELLS, the chancellor's son, came to Earth for the girl he loves—but will she ever forgive him? Reckless BELLAMY fought his way onto the transport pod to protect his sister, the other half of the only pair of siblings in the universe. And GLASS managed to escape back onto the ship, only to find that life there is just as dangerous as she feared it would be on Earth.Confronted with a savage land and haunted by secrets from their pasts, the hundred must fight to survive. They were never meant to be heroes, but they may be mankind's last hope.;"A terrifying plan began to take shape, and his chest tightened in fear as he realized what he would have to do. But Wells knew there was no other way. To save the girl he loved, he’d have to endanger the entire human race.
FUCK YOU, WELLS. There is another way. You stop being a selfish motherfucker whose brain is located in your fucking penis.This book is not a dystopian novel of a spaceship society. It's not a post-apocalyptic tale of survival. It's not about the nitty gritty of life within a group of the only humans left in the universe. It's a teenaged romance, where the characters' intelligence ranges anywhere from 5-9 on the 1-10 scale of idiocy. Whose life, whose society, whose spaceship colony has been endangered by a boy whose thought process first filters through his dick.The world building is piss poor and vague, and more of a scenic backdrop to the overwhelming romance-centric plot instead of being the focal point. If you are a reader who prefers their reads to be overwhelmingly romantic to the exclusion of an actual plot: this book is for you.Summary: We're on a spaceship. It's at least 300 years in the future (not quite sure what happened, nuclear stuff, things went boom? BAM, we're on a boat spaceship. Accept it). There are a lot of criminals. Specifically, more than 100, but 100 criminals (all of them teenagers, ranging from 12 years old to 18) have been sentenced to go repopulate the poisonous Planet Earth to see if it's habitable or still poisoned and deadly to humans due to radiation. This sentence might be a reprieve. It might be a death sentence. Who knows?Remember the whole ""the planet might be deadly"" thing? It's still in the air. Who cares?! Our intrepid boy, Wells Jaha, decides to sacrifice himself by committing a stupid and senseless crime in order to become a criminal and get shipped off to earth---potentially sentencing himself to death so he can be with his ONE TWOO WUV. Her name is Clarke. Wells' dad is surprisingly chill about sending his only son off to his death.One of the narrators (Glass, yes, her name is Glass) is not even on the damn ship headed to Earth. I guess she's a part of the 100, but her part of the novel involves going shopping for clothes to wear to the comet viewing and mourning the loss of her relationship with her ex, Luke, and driving everyone fucking nuts by not letting anyone know until the very end why the fuck she, a Phoenician socialite (because socialites are so very important on a spaceship that's the last bastion of humanity), wound up becoming a prisoner in the first place. And when we're finally told the reason, I just wanted to slap the girl upon the head, because I have a lot of sympathy in me, but stupidity doesn't deserve it.We also get to hear the stories from the POV of Bellamy, Wells, and Clarke as they go to Planet Earth and fall in love. Who will Clarke choose? Will it be dreamy dark, orphaned bad boy Bellamy? Will it be her gorgeous, wealthy, Judas of a knight in shining armor, who's actually not a knight in shining armor after all, but more of a sad, lost puppy who follows Clarke around with his tail (and his brains) between his legs.
He wasn’t the brave knight who’d come to rescue the princess. He was the reason she’d been locked away in the dungeon.
Will they get to observe the sunset on earth? Will they get to hear the lovely, joyful sound of a bird singing and marvel at its musicality? Will they share the first kiss on Earth in over 300 years?Wait a minute. They're supposed to be trying to SURVIVE on a potentially hazardous nuclear-damaged planet.Get out of here. No, really. Get out of here. This isn't the book you want if you want a realistic survival tale.The Setting: The crucial part to every dystopian novel is the setting, the history, the background. This book takes that concept and tells it, ""Fuck you, rationality, you have no place here. I will do whatever the fuck I want and what I want is to completely ignore the background except for the very barest of details because I want this to be a love story overall, and the background is just going to get in the way of the romance.""Truly, this book is just so vague and inconsistent in the development of a believable, compelling setting. The spaceship itself is so completely poorly defined. The ship itself is barely mentioned in any detail. We know there are three colonies on board, Phoenix, Walden, Arcadia. We don't know how many citizens there are. We can't see the sun and the sunset even though we can see the comet and stars from on board. We don't know how the three separate colonies are sectored up, we don't know how they're sectored up, we don't know their history, or how they became that way. We don't know where the spaceship is orbiting, besides the fact that it takes about 30 minutes to get from the ship to Earth. For some reason, some sectors have more water and resources than others.There's no background. There is no society. There is no culture.For a futuristic society, there is a surprising lack of diversity. Two of the main characters (both girls) have reddish-blonde hair.There's a lack of resource, and because of it, people are killed. So, so many people are killed. Most of them teenagers. The premise is that teenage delinquents are captured for the smallest of infractions---stealing food, for example, and sent to prison, called Confinement. There they stay until they're 18, where they get a Retrial, which is an absolute joke, because everyone knows that nobody ever, ever gets a Pardon. If you are less than 18, you get sent to prison until you're 18. Then you die. Which doesn't really make any sense when the government of the ship could just sentence the kids to death right away as soon as they're convicted, so save money, resources. And forget about committing a crime over the age of 18. You just get executed right away once you are convicted.SO. MANY. PEOPLE. ARE. KILLED. It makes no fucking sense. You are also sentenced to die if you have more than one child, under a vague ""Gaia Doctrine."" It's a wonder there are any people left on the spaceship at all. There is a surprising amount of hatred and resentment between the Waldens and the Phoenicians, which would have been more compelling if shit was actually EXPLAINED.There is absolutely nothing about the spaceship that's anything beyond an idea of a vaguely futuristic concept. The lack of background is utterly laughable if it wasn't so depressingly superficial.As for the Earth. Do I really need to explain the preposterousness of it all? We don't even know how the Earth was destroyed, except for some vague notion of a nuclear winter and a war that made the earth go boom. There was some enigmatic concept of an event called the ""Pre-Cataclysm,"" which was, once again, NEVER EXPLAINED IN DETAIL. There was something referred to as ""the burning of North America,"" and that's pretty much all you get on that. Radiation? What radiation. There's an instance of a two-headed deer. Let's just pretend that nuclear fallout is limited to one weird animal and everything is all safe again after a few centuries. Never mind radioactive traces in water and everything, which could last for thousands of years. Science? Fuck that shit. It's all about the romance.The Romance: Utterly ludicrous. There's 100 kids on board the spaceship sent to earth. They're all kids. They're from 12-18 years old. Some are petty thieves, some aren't criminals at all, some are murderers. Instead of some fucked-up, panedemonic Lord of the Flies situation, we have a few hotheads among a bunch of largely calm kids who just let a rational guy whose father is the Chancellor take over.Am I supposed to believe that?And in the midst of romance, there's survival. Wait a minute, that sounds wrong. It's supposed to be, in the midst of survival, there's a romance? No. I said it right the first time. The romance is so incredibly fucking overwhelming. There is a love triangle.
He grabbed on to a branch for balance, gasping as he tried to force air into his lungs. The girl he’d risked his life to protect wasn’t just kissing someone else—she was kissing the hothead who may have gotten his father killed.
There are observations of ""Oh, she's sooooooooo pretty."" ""Look at how the sunlight hits her hair!"" in the middle of trying to salvage what's left of the medicine on board the ship. Fuck you! This is supposed to be a dystopian tale! But no! One of the characters---the tough boy, Bellamy---even romanticizes the bags under Clarke's eyes GAG.
He cocked his head to the side and surveyed Clarke quizzically. The skin under her eyes was bruised with exhaustion, but the purple shadows just made them look greener.
Like, what the fuck? And screw the medicine. SCREW THE MEDICINE. Survival is useless if you can't have the one you love!
He didn’t care whether they’d found the missing medicine. There was no drug strong enough to repair a broken heart.
So you'd just let a poor girl die because you're too heartbroken, you selfish prick?God! There is so much idiocy in the name of love in this book From endangering the entire ship to potentially save a girl to potentially killing yourself so you can be with her to ignoring all common sense. And the girl left on board the spaceship is no better. Her name is Glass (lol wtf, Glass?), she escaped. Instead of running to her mother to say goodbye, Glass goes to see her ex-boyfriend. Glass claims to be ""desperate to see her mother,"" but there's no proof of it because despite the fact that she might be recaptured at any fucking moment, she takes that ONE opportunity to see her ex. Glass is not as sharp as, well...glass.Glass is in fucking Confinement. She has been for six months. She knows she's going to die. If I knew I were going to die, I'd be thinking of my own mortality, not spending all that time mooning over a boy. As an example of how idiotic Glass's thought process goes, this is what she thinks upon seeing Luke again: ""Being Luke’s ex-girlfriend somehow felt odder than being an escaped convict.""This book is too heavy on the romance, to the detriment of the plot. The remnants of the book is rendered utterly unsalvageable by the farcical actions of the main characters. I didn't have any trouble distinguishing between the four narrators, despite the fact that they are overwhelmingly similar in their idiocy. Not recommended, unless you want love shoved down your throat.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332969-the-100

Toby, onetime member of the Gods Gardeners and expert in mushrooms and bees, is still in love with street-smart Zeb, who has an interesting past. The Crakers’ reluctant prophet, Snowman-the-Jimmy, is hallucinating; Amanda is in shock from a Painballer attack; and Ivory Bill yearns for the provocative Swift Fox, who is flirting with Zeb. Meanwhile, giant Pigoons and malevolent Painballers threaten to attack. Told with wit, dizzying imagination, and dark humour, Booker Prize-winning Margaret Atwood’s unpredictable, chilling and hilarious MaddAddam takes us further into a challenging dystopian world and holds up a skewed mirror to our own possible future.";Yeah, that was also fantastic. I cried buckets at the end. Jesus.O&C is the male story -- all sex and longing, invention and death (look, I'm just telling you what I see). Flood is like the women's side -- lots more better women characters, but also lots of sexual violence. Friendship, salvation, vulnerability, hedgewitchery.(And lots of hot pink. Trust me, it works.)But MaddAddam is more like -- the male story again, but the woman observing and commenting on it, and it's entwined with her own -- just like the names, Adam and Madam, which also ties in with the end of the last book.That was great to read them all together but I'm kinda SHATTERED. Also I put off dinner and am starving, and got all growly when I was accidentally interrupted. Gonna cook trout. Thankfully we no longer eat pork.Thank you for the fish.

Nobody said it might actually get her killed.The sci-fi saga that began with the breakout bestseller Illuminae continues on board the Jump Station Heimdall, where two new characters will confront the next wave of the BeiTech assault.Hanna is the station captain’s pampered daughter; Nik the reluctant member of a notorious crime family. But while the pair are struggling with the realities of life aboard the galaxy’s most boring space station, little do they know that Kady Grant and the Hypatia are headed right toward Heimdall, carrying news of the Kerenza invasion.When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to defend their home. But alien predators are picking off the station residents one by one, and a malfunction in the station’s wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two before dinner. Soon Hanna and Nik aren’t just fighting for their own survival; the fate of everyone on the Hypatia—and possibly the known universe—is in their hands.But relax. They’ve totally got this. They hope.";"Until I find time to make a gif review (wtb Jay clone pst), here's a GEMINA FAQ:Is GEMINA a sequel or companion novel to ILLUMINAE?Both. Chronologically, it picks up about 5 minutes after ILLUMINAE ends. The book continues the story of the invasion of Kerenza IV, and many of the important questions asked in ILL are answered in ILL2, ie “The Hypatia was sending distress calls all through Illuminae, why did help never arrive?” and “Can there possibly be a dude in the universe hotter than Ezra Mason?""This is important: how do I pronounce the title?Soft G. Like so: JEM-ih-nuh.Is GEMINA still set aboard the Hypatia?GEMINA is primarily set on Jump Station Heimdall, the space station that Battlecarrier Alexander and Science Vessel Hypatia were trying to get to for most of ILLUMINAE. Heimdall, incidentally, is the name of the god who guarded Bifrost, the Rainbow Bridge, which connected Midgard and Asgard in Norse mythology.Yeah, yeah, that’s great. But I love Kady. Is she in GEMINA?Yes.I mean really in it? Not just a cameo?Yes. She’s in it. Sassier than ever.And what about the rest of the ILL gang?Well, as you know, ILL has a pretty high death toll, and we don’t want to issue any potential spoilers at this point. So all we’ll say is that the folks who survive book one will be seen again in book two.But the book is primarily focused on two new characters?Correctamundo. Our heroine this time is Hanna Donnelly, the daughter of Jump Station Heimdall's commander. She kinda looks like this gal. Our “hero” is Nik Malikov, a reluctant member of a criminal syndicate operating out of Heimdall station. He’s kinda like this guy. You can thank us later, ladies.Hey, didn't ILLUMINAE mention that Kady’s dad works on Heimdall station?Bingo.So what’s GEMINA about?The official jacket copy can be found at the top of this page. :)Is GEMINA going to be the same format as ILLUMINAE?Yes. Just like ILLUMINAE, GEMINA is a collection of documents, such as emails, IMs, security camera footage (and yes, Security Camera Footage guy is back in this book, too). But in the interests of making things bigger and better for the sequel, we also have a couple of new document styles in ILLUMINAE 2. One of which is going to BLOW YOUR GODDAMN MINDS. But we can’t talk about that one yet.Will GEMINA have a cover like ILLUMINAE? With the clear plastic dust jacket that shows part of the case cover underneath?Yes.

The Testing;Joelle Charbonneau;2013;2010;325;4.05;77419;yes;['Dystopia', 'Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Post Apocalyptic'];"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Isn't that what they say? But how close is too close when they may be one and the same?The Seven Stages War left much of the planet a charred wasteland. The future belongs to the next generation's chosen few who must rebuild it. But to enter this elite group, candidates must first pass The Testing—their one chance at a college education and a rewarding career.Cia Vale is honoured to be chosen as a Testing candidate; eager to prove her worthiness as a University student and future leader of the United Commonwealth. But on the eve of her departure, her father's advice hints at a darker side to her upcoming studies—trust no one.But surely she can trust Tomas, her handsome childhood friend who offers an alliance? Tomas, who seems to care more about her with the passing of every gruelling (and deadly) day of the Testing.To survive, Cia must choose: love without truth or life without trust.";I think I’ve read The Testing at least four different times in the past year - without actually ever having heard of this book. With the success of The Hunger Games, every new dystopian - and gosh darn it there are so many of them now - is being marketed as The Hunger Games meets this or The Hunger Games meets that, but never in a million years would I have suspected I’d read one so blatantly unoriginal that it’s not The Hunger Games meets anything, it’s just The Hunger Games - rehashed, ripped off, whatever. So rather than wasting my breath critiquing this clone, allow me to introduce to you to what I like to call how to write a cookie cutter Hunger Games style knockoff in four easy steps, no EasyBake oven required.Step One - The Generic Dystopian LandscapeThis one is simple. Have a bunch of bombastic sounding nation states with slightly futuristic names blow each other up for no apparent reason other than that this needs to happen in a postapocalypticish setting. Cue nuclear slash biochemical world war followed by unexplained natural catastrophes, leading to people living in generally hardscrabble conditions. Set this shit in one such overtaxed small town, where people live in general squalor but still have the time and materials to make and enjoy ice cream of all things, because when potable water and electricity are everyday concerns, dairy farms and refrigeration can magically ignore the rules of this world. Mix and match various technologies like crossbows, guns, and hovercars and hope the people reading this haven’t passed one of those logic exams where you’re presented with a list of things and asked to pick out the one that doesn’t belong. Oh, and randomly sprinkle in dangerous feral mutants, both animals and human, for added effect.Step Two - The Derivative Dystopian GovernmentBasically, big brother is watching. They know what’s good for you, even when you don’t. Even when you think they’re cruel, heartless SOBs - especially when you think they’re cruel, heartless SOBs. Just don't tell any of that to the people lurking around fomenting rebellion. Why are they doing any of this again?Step Three - The Hackneyed Battle Royale-Style Elimination CompetitionBecause killing off three quarters of your most promising citizens is such a great way of rebuilding society. Because blithely standing by while someone is twitching on the floor bleeding out from a nail in the eye is great not just for dramatic effect but to show those little shits who's boss. Because sending everyone off into the dystopian wilderness to duke it out and kill each other in a survival of the fittest style test hasn’t been done to death before. Because all the crossbow firing, gun shooting, knife fighting, mutant attacking survivalist stuff will make up for the otherwise complete lack of a plot. Because using stock characters like the complete jerk or the good guy who’s really a bad guy can convince people that this is some wholly original epic where loyalties are tested and bonds forged. Oh, and because doing all of this somehow adds something new to the dystopian genre (hint: it doesn't).Step Four - The Shallow Romance, Because We Gotta Have RomanceHandsome. Dimple. Same home town. No hints of a prior relationship, but they’ll trust each other anyway. Some light kissing, just because. Until he maybe possibly does something untrustworthy, but who knows? Did I mention the dimple?And with that, you too can write a Hunger Games knockoff just like The Testing. Just remember to give all the characters random, futuristic sounding names and don't get into the specifics of anything, that’ll just get in the way of the story.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13326831-the-testing
The Last Star;Rick Yancey;2016;2010;338;3.61;76901;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Aliens', 'Fantasy', 'Romance'];The enemy is Other. The enemy is us.They’re down here, they’re up there, they’re nowhere. They want the Earth, they want us to have it. They came to wipe us out, they came to save us.But beneath these riddles lies one truth: Cassie has been betrayed. So has Ringer. Zombie. Nugget. And all 7.5 billion people who used to live on our planet. Betrayed first by the Others, and now by ourselves.In these last days, Earth’s remaining survivors will need to decide what’s more important: saving themselves…or saving what makes us human.;"His eyes drank me in. Oh, the Evanness of it all, how he gulps down my presence like a guy stumbling upon an oasis in the desert.
What happened to this series?I was one of The 5th Wave's biggest fans, singing its praises to everyone who would listen. The Infinite Sea wasn't as strong for me, but that too was an enjoyable experience because I just clicked so much with Yancey's writing. This conclusion was a struggle to finish.As much as I loved the first book, I'm not going to pretend this series is something it isn't. An alien takeover story is not exactly original, Cassie Sullivan is not Katniss Everdeen, and there are some plot decisions that don't quite add up. But, that being said, I think The 5th Wave was so good for one big reason: atmosphere.I didn't even realize the importance of atmosphere until I read that book. Yancey enthused every page with a deep level of distrust. It was eerie, compelling and it forced you to look over your own shoulder. It was this, more than anything else, that pulled me so deeply inside the book.Here, that whole atmosphere just... disappears. Completely stops existing. That creeping, beautiful style of storytelling has been replaced with gems like this:
There’s been a shitload of huh? moments since the Others came, but this one has gotta be the huh-est of them all.
I've also seen lots of people talking about the ending, which is partly why I kept forcing myself through. However, though dramatic, it's really easy to predict. Arguably, it's the only thing that could have happened to avoid a forced ending where everyone holds hands and walks off into the sunset. I doubt anyone who's read a few other popular YA series will be surprised.But the worst thing about this book is the thing that's been niggling at the back of my mind throughout the entire trilogy - Cassie and Evan. They are so annoying. SO ANNOYING. Though where it was once masked by that writing and atmosphere I talked about, here it becomes reminiscent of New Adult romance novels:
My hands roamed his body, an undiscovered country, which henceforth I shall call Evanland. Hills and valleys, desert plains and forest glens, the landscape pockmarked with the scars of battle, criss-crossed by fault lines and unexpected vistas. And I am Cassie the Conquistador: The more territory I conquer, the more I want. ***My face is hot. I’m thinking of the night I landed on the shores of Evanland and planted my flag upon that sculpted beach.
If you're a bit confused what the hell is happening - yes, they are having sex. Did anyone actually read this book through and hear how that sounded before sending it to print?Between Cassie's disdain for the overtly sexual Grace and her constant descriptions of Evan's sexy arms and eyes - Tears welled in his eyes. It was like watching chocolate melt - she was insufferable. The saddest thing is that I really did love the first book, and even the second wasn't bad. It's not the kind of series where you can just read one book and be satisfied either - lots of questions are left unanswered. And honestly, viewing the series as a whole, I don't know that it's worth it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16131489-the-last-star
Wayward;Blake Crouch;2013;2010;298;4.15;76605;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook'];Welcome to Wayward Pines, population 461. Nestled amidst picture-perfect mountains, the idyllic town is a modern-day Eden...except for the electrified fence and razor wire, snipers scoping everything 24/7, and the relentless surveillance tracking each word and gesture.None of the residents know how they got here. They are told where to work, how to live, and who to marry. Some believe they are dead. Others think they’re trapped in an unfathomable experiment. Everyone secretly dreams of leaving, but those who dare face a terrifying surprise.Ethan Burke has seen the world beyond. He’s sheriff, and one of the few who knows the truth—Wayward Pines isn’t just a town. And what lies on the other side of the fence is a nightmare beyond anyone’s imagining.;"”I know what they need. Perfection all the time would drive them mad. For every perfect little town, there’s something ugly underneath. No dream without the nightmare.”

We all have secrets we carry around with us. As a species we aren’t really good at keeping secrets, even those rattling skeletons that could prove detrimental to our lives. In the end, most of us end up telling somebody. You can swear someone to secrecy, but the same itch, the same need to tell someone that compelled you to tell them, is whispering to them from the corners of their brain. This powerful urge, maybe with some help from some uninhibiting wine or soul exploding sex, will eventually gain the upper hand, and those locked away words will spill. They swear that person to secrecy, and so on and so on until everyone you know...well...knows. So the only way to keep a secret is to tell NO ONE.Recently appointed Sheriff Ethan Burke is carrying the granddaddy of all secrets. I was trying to think of something in the history of mankind that is a bigger secret. Knowledge of what Brutus has planned for Julius Caesar at the forum?...hmmm...nope. Finding out the Japanese plans for Pearl Harbor on December 6th?...not even close. How about the fact that I travelled back in time and handed Alois Hitler a FREE condom nine months prior to April 20th, 1889? Epic fail! Unfortunately...his appendage was too small to stay covered for the crucial moment (as it turns out that unfortunate disability runs in that family). See, and what did I just do...I told you!!Ethan tells his wife, Theresa.Guilt is hammering away at him. He has kept secrets (not very well... proving my point) in the past. Big ones like doinking his hot FBI partner Kate, who also is a resident of Wayward Pines. She also happens to be running a resistance movement against the powers that be. No one, except Ethan... well and now Theresa, knows exactly who that might be. The electric fence surrounding the town hums with high voltage electricity. Occasionally, one of the 461 residents uses the fence to kill themselves. Unfortunately, the smell of their charred flesh just makes people hungry for barbecue. Miraculously, new people show up to replace those who have been lost. They are quickly assimilated into the community. Speaking about the past is verboten. If people don’t accept the rules by joining the rest of the seemingly ecstatically happy people, they are fêted. Yes, there is a big group. Yes, there is a big party. No, those being fêted are not having a good time. What the FRILL is going on?As I said when I wrote the review for the first book in the trilogy, Pines, my recommendation is to watch the Wayward Pines TV series first. I know! Shocking! I feel like frog marching myself out to a stone cliff and throwing myself into the sea. The rule is always read the books first. *Sigh* one thing I’ve learned after decades of life is that flexibility, even as your joints refuse to be so, is important in all things. Rules were maybe not meant to be broken, but certainly, they were meant to be bent. Be the tree that sways in the wind.Watch the series, there are only ten episodes ( I really appreciate it when American TV shows some restraints with the number of episodes), and if you like the series, read the books. The books do differ from the series, but not by a large margin. In for a penny in for a pound, on to book three.

A Closed and Common Orbit;Becky  Chambers;2016;2010;365;4.37;76216;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Space'];Lovelace was once merely a ship's artificial intelligence. When she wakes up in an new body, following a total system shut-down and reboot, she has no memory of what came before. As Lovelace learns to negotiate the universe and discover who she is, she makes friends with Pepper, an excitable engineer, who's determined to help her learn and grow.Together, Pepper and Lovey will discover that no matter how vast space is, two people can fill it together.The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet introduced readers to the incredible world of Rosemary Harper, a young woman with a restless soul and secrets to keep. When she joined the crew of the Wayfarer, an intergalactic ship, she got more than she bargained for - and learned to live with, and love, her rag-tag collection of crewmates.A Closed and Common Orbit is the stand-alone sequel to Becky Chambers' beloved debut novel The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and is perfect for fans of Firefly, Joss Whedon, Mass Effect and Star Wars.;"I understand that some people weren't fans of The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet. Personally, in my heart of hearts, I kind of suspected they might be suffering from Grinch syndrome,* but I respected it, because there were indeed a few flaws.This time, I won't keep my suspicions to myself: if you do not find this book enjoyable, you need to witness a little village of Whos holding hands and singing even though you just stole their Christmas Beast.** Or, just possibly, it is completely not your style of book. I'm fairly certain those are the only two choices here.Don't get me wrong as this by no means a sugary-sweet, singing festival: there is a lot more edginess, with subsistence living and even a touch of horror, but there's something equally wonderful--or better--in the story as a whole. It isn't at all a direct sequel to A Long Way, although the ending of that book does go a long way (I couldn't help myself) towards explaining the premise of this story. No matter, as Chambers is kind enough to start just twenty-eight minutes after the last book, although without the Wayfarer crew. It begins with Lovelace the AI program, fresh in her new synthetic body, which she continually refers to as her 'kit.' It's a brilliant little device that constantly distances both the former Lovelace and the reader from her new housing. Eventually she picks a name, Sidra. Narrative then jumps into the story of Jane 23, a young female who works first cleaning then repairing parts with her clone-sisters. Chapters go back and forth between the two, but are occasionally interrupted by a type of underground message boards where less-than-law-abiding citizens talk shop. Often I dislike this narrative technique, but there's solid continuity as well as thematic parallels. As both were written well but with different plotting tensions, I found myself both eager and reluctant at the end of each chapter to resume the other story. In a way, both are stories of survival and of identity, and they dovetail beautifully. I do have a lingering question or two, primarily Sidra's solution  of installing herself in the walls of a bar. I thought it was reasonably clear from the AI manual that she might grow bored being in one place, and that a variety of customers does not seem adequate stimulus, Linking available or not. Like A Long Way, there was a couple of very rapid plot developments near the end  particularly the installation of Owl and the use of the pet-bots as extended networks. While they do serve to nicely wrap things up, the pacing and resolution felt pressured. I felt a little like, once again, someone told Chambers to get a move on and finish up. Not that I  would have said that, mind you. But that's the impression I was left with in both books. Well, whatever; I'm no Grinch*** to quibble the minor details. I'm very glad I added this one to my own physical library, as I think it will hold up well to a re-read. I strongly recommend it.*

I assumed that the pace was going to quicken, since Persepolis Rising is moving us into the final three Expanse novels, but I am in awe at how much this book moved the series forward from where we left off in 
Babylon’s Ashes

. We are now nearing the end of the long Expanse arc that began with 
Leviathan Wakes

 in 2011, and it is thrilling to see where we're heading.As far as the story goes: The only constant is change, and empires aren’t built overnight. That rise to power is fraught with great and terrible things. There are good and bad people on multiple sides of every argument. History is full of grey, contradictions, and passionate people with good intentions committing atrocities for their causes. 
Persepolis Rising
 feels like the story of the necessarily messy history between A and B. The history that usually gets rewritten by the victors.This narrative also brings with it some unique adaptation challenges for the Amazon television series. Thirty years have passed between the end of Babylon's Ashes and the beginning of Persepolis Rising, making most of the crew of the Rocinante at least in their seventies. Of course, these are ""future humanity"" seventies, and it is hinted that there is regenerative medicine available. Seventies may be the new thirties.“It seemed to her that the real sign you were getting old was when you stopped needing to prove you weren’t getting old.”As much as I want this series to last forever, I'm a firm believer that good stories end, and great stories end well. Persepolis Rising is setting up the Expanse saga for inclusion in the latter category.I can’t wait for 
Tiamat’s Wrath

 in 2019, with the final Expanse novel to follow in 2020. I believe a tenth book which collects the short stories and novellas together in print for the first time is scheduled to follow in 2021.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28335696-persepolis-rising

And with the worsening Aether storms threatening the tribe's precarious existence, Aria begins to fear that leaving Perry behind might be the only way to save them both.Threatened by false friends and powerful temptations, Aria and Perry wonder, can their love survive through the ever night?;"Well, finally after a series of disappointing sequels this year (Rebel Heart, Insurgent, The Calling) I've found a book that was even better than its predecessor. I think Rossi has gone even further with this installment, building on her characters and their relationships with one another, creating a number of funny, sad and ultimately memorable little moments that made me even more invested in the bigger picture. What she does best here is get the balance right between fast-paced action/adventure scenes and character development, I now have no doubt in my mind as to whether I'll be reading the next book.In Through the Ever Night, Perry and Aria face many challenges to their relationship and to their lives. Now that Perry is Blood Lord of the Tides, he carries all the responsibility for the welfare of his people and it turns out to be a very heavy burden. Not only that, but the Tides are not so ready to welcome Aria and some of them begin to question whether Perry is a suitable leader or too governed by his heart. Roar becomes an even more prominent character too (and possibly my favourite) and I really liked the way Rossi managed to successfully write a platonic and convincing relationship between male and female characters of roughly the same age - this doesn't happen too often unless the guy is the stereotypical ""gay friend"".Another thing I noticed - and was a refreshing change to the genre - is that the author allows bad stuff to happen. What I mean by this is that the good guys don't always get what they want and sometimes things don't end with a happily ever after - I just appreciate this more realistic approach to storytelling. In real life, not everything works out for the good people and Rossi shows that here. The funny thing is, that of all those sequels I was looking forward to, Through the Ever Night was the one I was anticipating the least for some reason. But this suspenseful, action-packed read was pretty fabulous, I don't think fans of the first will have anything to worry about because this sequel takes all the elements that we loved from Under the Never Sky and multiplies them by a hundred. I enjoyed it immensely and I can't imagine I will be forgetting the hilarious duet scene with Aria and Roar for a long while............................................................................................................Before reading:Who is this dude and what has he done with Perry?Okay, firstly: ""His hair looked like it had never seen a brush. Snarled blond ropes, all uneven in length and color, coiling in every direction."" - pg 110 Um, so not only has he shopped at Abercrombie & Fitch since the last book, he's also found time for a cut and dye job.Secondly, this is totally not the Perry I was picturing after the first cover was: All shirtless and wild hair and perhaps you can't just ask people this but I can't help myself so:";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13253276-through-the-ever-night
The Heart Goes Last;Margaret Atwood;2013;2010;320;3.4;71535;yes;['Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Canada', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Adult'];"Margaret Atwood puts the human heart to the ultimate test in an utterly brilliant new novel that is as visionary as The Handmaid's Tale and as richly imagined as The Blind Assassin.Stan and Charmaine are a married couple trying to stay afloat in the midst of an economic and social collapse. Job loss has forced them to live in their car, leaving them vulnerable to roving gangs. They desperately need to turn their situation around - and fast. The Positron Project in the town of Consilience seems to be the answer to their prayers. No one is unemployed and everyone gets a comfortable, clean house to live in... for six months out of the year. On alternating months, residents of Consilience must leave their homes and function as inmates in the Positron prison system. Once their month of service in the prison is completed, they can return to their ""civilian"" homes. At first, this doesn't seem like too much of a sacrifice to make in order to have a roof over one's head and food to eat. But when Charmaine becomes romantically involved with the man who lives in their house during the months when she and Stan are in the prison, a series of troubling events unfolds, putting Stan's life in danger. With each passing day, Positron looks less like a prayer answered and more like a chilling prophecy fulfilled.";"Be careful what you wish for:“What if we get rejected?” “What if we get accepted?”When ignorance is bliss, ‘tis folly to be wise.Cecily wished for the latest Atwood. Starting a new Atwood is a treat, especially one hot off the press. She has enjoyed nine* Atwoods over the years, all very different, but all excellent. Cecily’s not initially sure quite what to expect with this one, other than speculative fiction, with a dystopian twist, but she trusts Atwood with this genre. Then again, there was a tenth* Atwood she read relatively recently that disappointed (MaddAddam, which I reviewed HERE), but she quickly dismisses that as a blip in an otherwise impressive oeuvre. Atwood is a powerful voice, who balances light and shade, horror and humour, prepared to shock, but not to harm or frustrate her readers.And so on. The whole book is told in this way: third-person, from two main points of view, but with so much paraphrased inner monologue, it almost feels like first. That ought to be really engaging, but I didn’t really engage.Overall, this starts off as speculative fiction and ends up as dystopian farce. It reads like a rehash of ideas Atwood has done better before. She can't need the money, and unlike David Mitchell’s Slade House, which I reviewed HERE, this doesn’t feel like creative exuberance let loose, so I'm puzzled as well as disappointed. Hence 2.5* for my enjoyment, rounded down. (If trying to give an objective rating, I would award 3*.)18 months later, Atwood wrote another satire based in a prison. I liked that slightly more than this (3*), but she had better source material, as it was a retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest, titled Hag-Seed, which I reviewed HERE.The SetupIn the near future, Stan and Charmaine are living in their car, surviving on cash and tips from her waitressing job, and ever fearful of being robbed or raped by those more destitute and desperate than they are. There’s been a huge financial collapse: Stan lost his job developing empathy modules for robots, and Charmaine lost hers organising entertainment for pensioners in a Ruby Slippers care home.Then they hear about the Positron Project, in the town of Consilience: those who join are guaranteed a home and work. The catch is they alternate one month in prison with one month out. And that they have to sign up for life. And that they can’t ever leave. Or contact the outside world. And it turns out that the whole set up is cult-like and Orwellian. But hey, it solves crime, unemployment and almost everything else. What’s not to like?CONSILIENCE = CONS + RESILIENCEHow much resilience does the book have? How much do I, as a reader, have? Not enough on either count.I never believed in this world. I wanted to, but I couldn’t. Not from the outset, nor when there was more explanation.""Be the Person You’ve Always Wanted to Be”That’s a Positron promise, but what do you want to be, and what if you are, or want to be two versions of yourself? The thrill and the fear of “I’m not the same with him”. This is explored in several ways: the monthly swap-around means everyone has an Alternate, who they’re never supposed to meet; several characters use, or are known by an alias; having another identity opens up new ways of being and behaving; and then there are the Elvises in the Elvisorium (yes, really) and the Marilyns somewhere, and the sexbots…Possilibots – and a Step BeyondAre sexbots a way to exorcise or exercise taboo desires?Few people object to dildoes in principle, and inflatable dolls are mainly seen as joke material. Are sexbots any different? If they reduce sex trafficking and make a profit, that’s surely win-win, isn’t it? But what if they are so realistic as to be almost indistinguishable from real people? And what if they are modelled on specific people - who haven’t consented to their image being appropriated in this way? What if you can programme them to say “No”? Most chillingly, what about kiddybots? But all those are just an interim phase of development. Far better, from a client and profit perspective, is taking attractive women and painlessly modifying their brains to wipe all memory of previous lovers, and ensure that when they awake, their passions – strong passions – are permanently imprinted on the waiting client, who is the first face they see. Everyone’s happy: the client has a monogamous nymphomaniac partner whose life is, in material ways, better than before. Lack of consent is a minor means to a socially worthwhile end. But does neurological lust really count as lust, let alone love? What happens if the client falls in love or lust with someone else, but has an obsessive and uncontrollable ex?Casual HomophobiaThere’s lots of sex, all of it hetero, and none of it nice. Stan is passively, mildly, but repeatedly, homophobic. That’s OK; people are. But it’s never challenged. That’s not OK. The Power of Love, the Limits of ForgivenessThis is the true heart of the book. And it goes last.Could you forgive a one-night stand, a long-term affair, wishing you dead, attempted murder, or just obsessive voyeurism, stalking or fantasising about another? If your partner was pressured into such things, would that make forgiveness easier, or would you doubt how much pressure was required?Does love make forgiveness easier, or mean the pain of betrayal is so great, that forgiveness is harder? And does your own guilt about anything similar strengthen or weaken your ability to forgive?“Stolen hours… stolen kisses”, but who’s it stealing from if your partner doesn’t know? Maybe it’s better (certainly easier) to live in ignorance and, when truth intrudes, denial (a recurring theme, in various contexts). But that’s surely not sustainable in the longer term. Is happy ever after possible?The ultimate test is having the power to go, but choosing to stay.The final choice in the book, and indeed, the initial one, is between freedom and security. Someone is asked if they want knowledge that will make them less secure, but more free. Would you, like Eve in Eden, choose Knowledge, or would you settle for security that is based on ignorance?Freedom feels like the right answer, but security the easier one.In an ideal world, there would be no need to make such a choice. But ideal worlds exist only in fantasy.Big Ideas; So Many PossibilitiesThe final half dozen pages made a last-ditch attempt to examine some of the huge and important issues that were bubbling under the surface all along, but were never really explored adequately or convincingly. Too little, too late.The issues include:Sex of all kinds, most of it exploitative in some way; civil liberties; informed consent (not just sexual, but certainly including that); brainwashing and propaganda; social control and compliance (cf Zimbardo); capitalism and profit; sex; identity; criminality, punishment and reform; love, betrayal and forgiveness; euthanasia; human trafficking and prostitution; murder; “recycling”; care homes for the elderly; Elvis; surveillance; pornography; AI robots; what makes us human; blackmail and extortion; free will; industrial espionage; exploitative sex; the good of society against the good of the individual, and empathy (it’s Stan’s original specialism, and something Charmaine is either very good at (sacramental attitude to giving a good death) or very bad at (doing it at all – but then she is highly suggestible and credulous)).I think the book might work better if you start reading here, then go to the beginning and read the rest as backstory!Blue Knitted Teddy BearsA cute-kinky trope throughout the book. In her prison stints, Charmaine is in a knitting group (as well as her job in the bakery and then Medications Administration). All they ever knit are blue teddy bears. These crop up all over the plot: children play with them in Consilience kindergarten; when in transit, Stan wakes up in a big container of them; Jocelyn uses one for smuggling a message; people dream of them; they’re used as walkie-talkies; they’re supplied with kiddybots for authenticity; and, most memorably, the reconfigured brain of Veronica is imprinted on one (supposedly by mistake).A Few HolesI may have missed the answers to some of these, but they niggled and distracted, so reducing my enjoyment:•	I fundamentally couldn’t believe the business model of Positron, even when its darkest aspects were exposed: sure, they’d have brought in lots of revenue, but the development timescales and costs were staggering. I’m not sure there would have been any profit.•	I fundamentally couldn’t believe the premise of giving prisoners alternate months off turning them into good citizens. However, that’s probably covered by the fact there were very few real prisoners for any length of time (Medications Administrations), mostly minor offenders.•	Self-sufficiency is the aim, and they have chickens, pigs and cows, but why no fish? High protein, and not requiring much space.•	Why do desperate men prefer sex with chickens to sex with pigs or cows? (I don’t actually want an answer!) Why are they so desperate anyway, when they’re only apart from their wives for a month?•	How do switchover days work, especially as there is time for the prohibited overlap between Alternates?•	When Stan and Charmaine don’t switchover one month, how come the guys in the scooter repair shop know he was there last month, rather than assuming he’s new?•	There were Elvis sexbots and “real” Elvises, the idea being to substitute the bots if the client wanted more than the live Elvis wanted to provide. If the tech was SO advanced, why not just have the bot version from the start? It seemed weirdly complex and designed just to make the story “work” by having Stan go to the Elvisorium.Quotes•	“Do you believe in free will?”•	“He wishes he were the object of that excitement, and not the [new] dishwasher.”•	He asks “Do you miss me?” but wants to ask “Do you hunger for me, do you burn for me?” “He wants sex that can’t be helped” but instead, it’s “sex that [she] enacts, like yoga, with careful breath control”.•	“Charmaine finds switchover days almost festive… Living two lives means there’s always something different to look forward to.”•	“Chemistry can be like magic. It can be merciless.”•	Hedge-trimming is calming, like biting nails, “it’s repetitive, it imitates meaningful activity, and it’s violent”.•	“She gives good death.” (The heart goes last.)•	“They wanted her to use her head and discard her heart; but it wasn’t so easy, because the heart goes last.”•	“She wants something that can feel resentment, and even rage. Feel it and have to repress it.”•	“A plate of tousled breakfast leftovers.”•	“She’s been a distraction for him, but not a necessity of life.”•	“There are only two kinds of people admitted to the Medications Administration wing: those who do and those who are done to.”•	“Not that he gives much of a flying fuck about freedom and democracy, since they haven’t performed that well for him personally.”•	“A kind of damp, sickly, pious look. Reverence crossed with hidden lust, but behind that a determination to get what he wants.”•	They “let her pas because she is sanctified by mourning”.•	“An LED smile: light, but no heat.”•	“’Isn’t this nice?’ they coo, in case there’s any doubt, which there is.”•	“You’re free to go.”Image source: http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24388326-the-heart-goes-last

Enclave;Ann Aguirre;2011;2010;259;3.91;70011;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Zombies', 'Science Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Fantasy', 'Romance'];New York City has been decimated by war and plague, and most of civilization has migrated to underground enclaves, where life expectancy is no more than the early 20's. When Deuce turns 15, she takes on her role as a Huntress, and is paired with Fade, a teenage Hunter who lived Topside as a young boy. When she and Fade discover that the neighboring enclave has been decimated by the tunnel monsters--or Freaks--who seem to be growing more organized, the elders refuse to listen to warnings. And when Deuce and Fade are exiled from the enclave, the girl born in darkness must survive in daylight--guided by Fade's long-ago memories--in the ruins of a city whose population has dwindled to a few dangerous gangs.Ann Aguirre's thrilling young adult novel is the story of two young people in an apocalyptic world--facing dangers, and feelings, unlike any they've ever known.;"I thought for a little bit about how to review this book, if I should go over all the weird mistakes and struggles with the world building chronologically or if I should just jump in at what bothered me most and work backwards. Generally, following the timeline of the book makes for a better review, but since I am so utterly horrified by the last third of the book I can't stomach talking about things like sewer systems, night vision, bad name choices, and human nature. All that keeps ringing in my mind when I look at the cover of this book are quotes from the main character on the subject of rape. Enclave is a YA dystopian novel about an incredibly dark world. I've read a few YA dystopians where rape came into play, but I have never encountered the subject treated as cavalier by an author and the main character. The handling of it could not have been more repulsive.As necessary background, Deuce grew up in a small and contained underground community which she is kicked out of after confessing to a crime she didn't commit to spare an equally innocent friend. She is thrust into a new world with a guide named Fade who hasn't been a part of the above ground world for many years. The people directly above their sewer grates are hostile. When Deuce and Fade come off a second battle with a gang who call themselves 'Wolves,' Deuce is taken off to be turned into a breeder -- essentially to be raped repeatedly in attempts to reproduce with her and grow their population, and Fade is taken off to be hunted down and eaten. Deuce manages to escape with the help of Tegan, a girl who was taken by the Wolves earlier and has spent much of her young life being raped and giving birth to stillborn children. Together, Tegan and Deuce rescue Fade.Fade, Deuce, and Tegan are hunted down by the Wolves while trying to escape the city. Stalker, the head of this gang, manages to get a hold of someone who helped them along the way so he can lure them out of hiding. Before things can come to a fight they are attacked by Freaks/Eaters/Muties who are the story's monsters. They decide to join forces with Stalker who is the sole surviving Wolf. They do this despite Tegan's vehement protests. They do this despite knowing Tegan was raped by the gang he was in charge of for years, despite the fact that he would very possibly have decided to rape Deuce and despite knowing he probably committed similar horrific acts for years.To a point, I could have tolerated almost all of this. I can deal with a lot of ugly things in books if it makes sense with the world building -- after all, our world is sometimes a very ugly place too. What I couldn't stand was Deuce's total lack of empathy for anything Tegan went through. She legitimately looks at Tegan at one point and wonders how Tegan could let herself be raped repeatedly, how she could let them and not die fighting them off -- this from a girl who grew up terrified she would get assigned as a breeder instead of a hunter in her own tribe, this from a girl who grew up small and nameless and helpless. The lack of empathy was not only disgusting but incomprehensible.To make matters worse, Stalker is a potential love interest for Deuce. He practices fighting with her as an excuse to touch her and eventually pushes her against a tree and kisses her. She kisses him back. I wanted to vomit in a hat. He called her ""Dove"" after the bird as a fucking term of endearment. He says it's because doves are vulnerable and frail looking but they can fly away from predators. This does not even make sense, seeing as Deuce does not run/fly away; she fights. The nickname takes away from everything she built herself up to be and she lets him do it. Again, I wanted to throw up.As for the lackluster world building: As far as I know, we aren't told how old Fade and Deuce are in the text, although the jacket description says 15. I believe the author was forced to play it loose by her own world building. Living to 25 in the Enclave makes you an ancient elder so one would think children would be named and assigned jobs much older. Even if you wait until they're 13 that's more than half the maximum expectation of their lives without a name, without contributing substantially to the community. Fade and Deuce don't have a listed ages within the text of the book because they were written as older than 13, but that does not fit with the world building. As far as I'm concerned the no name until you're all grown isn't practical and goes against human nature.Tunnel system mistakes: I don't understand how there are defensible/livable areas in a tunnel system, especially with clean running water 100 years after the world ends. I'm not sure how people could live down there with the diet described in the book: essentially rat meat, mushrooms, and fish. I guess that's why 25 is considered old. In reality they all would've been wiped out by disease long before this book could've taken place.Sunlight problems: I'm not going to pretend I know how a cave dwelling person would adjust to sunlight after living underground all her life, but I'm going to say that I think this was all highly unrealistic. She wears sunglasses she found and gets a slight sunburn? WTF? Those miners in Chile who were trapped underground for two months had to wear special sunglasses for almost as long as they were trapped or risk going blind. I don't think the author did appropriate research on this front, but I'm not inclined to do it for her and research out what actually would've happened to Deuce and Fade.I could go on and on here, but I don't care. All I keep doing is thinking about Stalker as a love interest and feeling sick to my stomach. I don't understand how people can find him redeemable or the storyline acceptable. A lot of reviewers I respect rated it a fair bit higher than me, all I can think is that we did not read the book the same way.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7137327-enclave
The Last Town;Blake Crouch;2014;2010;294;4.1;69882;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook'];"Welcome to Wayward Pines, the last town.Secret Service agent Ethan Burke arrived in Wayward Pines, Idaho, three weeks ago. In this town, people are told who to marry, where to live, where to work. Their children are taught that David Pilcher, the town’s creator, is god. No one is allowed to leave; even asking questions can get you killed.But Ethan has discovered the astonishing secret of what lies beyond the electrified fence that surrounds Wayward Pines and protects it from the terrifying world beyond. It is a secret that has the entire population completely under the control of a madman and his army of followers, a secret that is about to come storming through the fence to wipe out this last, fragile remnant of humanity.";”What else could I have possibly done for you people? I gave you food. I gave you shelter. I gave you purpose. I protected you from the knowledge you couldn’t handle. From the harsh truth of the world that exists beyond the fence. And each of you had to do one thing. One!  Goddamn!  Thing!” He shrieked the words. “Obey me.”David Pilcher is suffering from a god complex. Not as difficult to understand as it has been for other figures throughout history, especially since humanity only exists at this point in time because he made it so. The question is, was it meant to be saved?The people are nestled in their Eden, a place called Wayward Pines. Pilcher has eliminated all the distractions that kept people from interacting face to face, such as the internet, iPads, iPhones, that allowed people to become mired in social media instead of having actual relationships with people. He was trying to recreate a 1950s sensibility. The thing of it is, no matter what you do, it is impossible to make people happy. Humanity isn’t designed to allow itself to be contented, sooner or later someone is going to come along who wants free will and will do whatever it takes to get it. That man is Ethan Burke.He offers the apple, and they eat it. He rips the gossamer from around their eyes and lets them see and experience the full horror of what has happened to their world. Mind blowing. Pilcher is beyond furious, but then he has a good role model from the God depicted in the Bible. He throws the biggest tantrum since that other God flooded the Earth. He, too, can destroy what he created. If they disobey, then they must pay the price. He knows from experience that people can’t necessarily handle the truth. ”Your fatal flaw, Ethan, is that you’re under the mistaken impression that people are like you. That they have the courage, your fearlessness, your will. You and I are exceptions, cut from the same cloth. Even my people in the mountain struggle with the fear. But not you and me. We know the truth. We aren’t afraid to look it in the eye. Only difference being, I’m aware of this fact, and it’s something you’re going to learn slowly and painfully and at great cost of human life. But you’ll remember this conversation one day, Ethan. You’ll understand why I did the things I did.”He shuts down the electric fence. He lets the aberrations in. ”None of them were larger than he was, but their muscle tone was extraordinary.They looked---Like humanity wrapped in the trappings of a monster.Equipped with talons, instead of fingers, teeth designed for cutting and tearing, they brandished arms that seemed too long in proportion to the rest of their body. Longer even than their legs.He said under his breath, like a prayer, ‘What the hell are you?’Fear suddenly wore him like a glove.”I must admit that season one of Wayward Pines was must see TV every week. The first season covers all three books. There are variations between the books and the show, but not really that many. Blake Crouch was heavily involved with the making of the TV series. Season Two is starting up in May of 2016 and will be based on new material not covered in the books. I was content for them to stop with just one season, but I have to admit I’m curious to see where they intend to go with the concept. The real tension and psychological discomfort was much higher in the first two books. This book is more of one long chase scene, still compelling, but all the rabbits have been pulled out of the hat in the earlier two books. Burke becomes Moses, and the responsibility weighs heavily on him.”There was no coming to terms with the fact that he was a member of a species on the verge of extinction.It filled every moment with meaning.It filled every moment with horror.”If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20423680-the-last-town

THEY CONTAIN HUGE SPOILERS.After the Book Four(Coming Soon):AHEAD ARE SPOILERS. WATCH OUT.DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.Four. Still awesome as ever!Five. Was suspicious to me from the start.(I had a theory he was Setkarus Ra, but that theory got kicked away).Six. Still the same badass.Seven. Marina's still got it!!Eight. WHY did he have to DIE?Nine. That one character that swears too much.Ten/Ella. Oh my...Sam and His Father. Loving the fact they are back. :DSarah. STILL NO COMMENT. UGH.Adam. I trust him...Setkarus Ra. HE'S THE EVIL OVERLORD.Pittacus. DEAD.The Government. Humans...Them Mogs. Are still Mogs.Overall, the book is AMAZING. A one sentence sum up of what I thought of the book: Dashing and exciting, a worthy read and lives up to the other books well!Now there are topics I want to cover and talk about.1. Setkarus Ra and 'Number Ten'?When Ten(Ella) has a VERY peculiar dream about Setkarus Ra, I started to think about what Setkarus was doing and why he would go into Ten's dreams of all numbers.“He—he gets down on his knees.” Her voice drops to a chilled whisper. “He holds one of my hands in both of his, and he asks me if I’ve read the letter.”My reaction:The 'getting down on knees' and 'hand-holding' idea sprung up a love interest idea in my head. Creepy, but seemingly appropriate. And the fact that Ten can change age kind of thins the borders. But of course he would be using her. Mogadorians have feelings, yes (Adam is a vivid example of this.), but Setkarus Ra is heading in...another direction.Asking her if she read the letter would be asking her if she knew she was not chosen by the Lorien, that she ISN'T the so-called Number Ten, that she ISN'T held be the Loric charm that forces the Mogadorians to kill them in ONLY a certain order.So he knows she's not chosen. Is he TRYING to make her feel like an outcast and turn her against the Loric, AND make her his(Again, I must say, CREEPY). This is the reason why he entered her dreams, other then Six or Seven's.2. Five's Betrayal Sequence.Funny enough, Five's betrayal didn't surprise me. It was WAAAAAY too obvious. I was expecting it at the moment they met him.  3. The Book Was Actually GREAT!(because it's becoming trend where the sequels/prequels suck in YA novels these days)The story structure was still intact and no character became stupid and annoying(some may argue Sarah is an issue, but I prefer not to be biased, so I'll remain silent--Okay I don't really like her as a character either.). This fact surprised me.4. Who Dies NextAnother character death would be expected in the next book. It would be great if it was someone NO ONE expects to die.Overall, amazing. Next Book? Title Theory: The Reign of Ten.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15861491-the-fall-of-five
Tiamat's Wrath;James S.A. Corey;2019;2010;534;4.57;69129;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fantasy'];Thirteen hundred gates have opened to solar systems around the galaxy. But as humanity builds its interstellar empire in the alien ruins, the mysteries and threats grow deeper.In the dead systems where gates lead to stranger things than alien planets, Elvi Okoye begins a desperate search to discover the nature of a genocide that happened before the first human beings existed, and to find weapons to fight a war against forces at the edge of the imaginable. But the price of that knowledge may be higher than she can pay.At the heart of the empire, Teresa Duarte prepares to take on the burden of her father's godlike ambition. The sociopathic scientist Paolo Cortázar and the Mephistophelian prisoner James Holden are only two of the dangers in a palace thick with intrigue, but Teresa has a mind of her own and secrets even her father the emperor doesn't guess.And throughout the wide human empire, the scattered crew of the Rocinante fights a brave rear-guard action against Duarte's authoritarian regime. Memory of the old order falls away, and a future under Laconia's eternal rule -- and with it, a battle that humanity can only lose - seems more and more certain. Because against the terrors that lie between worlds, courage and ambition will not be enough...;“The universe is always stranger than you think. It didn’t matter how broad her imagination was, how cynical, how joyous and open, how well researched or wild minded. The universe was always stranger. Every dream, every imagining, however lavish and improbable, inevitably fell short of the truth.”11/22/21 3rd reread update:Goddamn, this book is so satisfying. Teresa's journey blows me away every time. How do they keep doing this to me?Original Review:March 26th rolls around, my copy of Tiamat’s Wrath, the penultimate novel in the long running Expanse series downloads to my Kobo, I pick it up and read the first sentence. Four words, three of them innocuous enough, but the fourth? James S.A. Corey, you sonsofbitches, that’s how it’s gonna be? Damn. Well, okay then, I applaud your chutzpah. Let’s do this thing. This is the best Expanse novel, and honestly one of my favorite sci-fi novels from the last decade. Tiamat’s Wrath is unbelievably fun and fully delivers the goods. Big (and small) character moments, a game changing story, some mysteries resolved, new mysteries to fill their void. But it's also incredible touching. Particularly in the ways it deals with childhood development, trauma, and finding a new normal. With an anonymous gun to my head, forced to make a decision, I’d put it above Nemesis Games in a full rank of these novels. It blows the others out of the water as far as page-turning pure enjoyment goes, and it’s definitely the most satisfying story. Every character has an incredible arc. This is the second part of the final three-parter, and you would be correct to assume that shit gets real. The stakes are high, and there are reverberating consequences.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28335698-tiamat-s-wrath
Aurora Rising;Amie Kaufman;2019;2010;473;4.1;69101;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Audiobook', 'Fiction', 'Space'];"From the internationally bestselling authors of THE ILLUMINAE FILES comes an epic new science fiction adventure.The year is 2380, and the graduating cadets of Aurora Academy are being assigned their first missions. Star pupil Tyler Jones is ready to recruit the squad of his dreams, but his own boneheaded heroism sees him stuck with the dregs nobody else in the Academy would touch…A cocky diplomat with a black belt in sarcasmA sociopath scientist with a fondness for shooting her bunkmatesA smart-ass techwiz with the galaxy’s biggest chip on his shoulderAn alien warrior with anger management issuesA tomboy pilot who’s totally not into him, in case you were wonderingAnd Ty’s squad isn’t even his biggest problem—that’d be Aurora Jie-Lin O’Malley, the girl he’s just rescued from interdimensional space. Trapped in cryo-sleep for two centuries, Auri is a girl out of time and out of her depth. But she could be the catalyst that starts a war millions of years in the making, and Tyler’s squad of losers, discipline-cases and misfits might just be the last hope for the entire galaxy.
They're not the heroes we deserve. They're just the ones we could find. Nobody panic.";(leaning forward so my lips touch the microphone) it's a YIKES from me!I, a keen admirer of Jay Kristoff and Amie Kaufman since 2017 when I read The Illuminae Files, felt fairly positive about this book. I tried to hold on to that wide-eyed optimism while reading this book, but it was like trying to hold on to smoke or shadow. Boredom had its hooks in me before I was even halfway through the novel, and I was ju glad when this one was over, not gonna lie. That said, Aurora Rising does kick off with a high-concept punch.When Legionnaire Tyler Jones investigates a distress call mere hours before the squad Draft and discovers a 220-year-old cryogenically frozen girl, what he should do and what he would do had no bearing upon each other. Jones misses the Draft but rescues the girl—an endeavor which, heroic though it was, is bound to catch up with him sooner or later. He is assigned Squad Leader to a crew of leftover misfits, and their first mission ends with cataclysm and apocalypse: Aurora Jie-Lin O’Malley is explicably no longer encased in frozen cryogel, but is more inexplicably on their ship.Mistrust immediately spools out between them and Aurora, but a cryptic message from two of their superiors in which they implicitly—but fervently—insist that they protect her, and in light of their acceleration toward doom, the squad decides to mine for answers that will hopefully cast a decent enough light into the depths into which they had all unwisely ventured. However, they quickly find out that they’re facing inexorable forces and they had at best a coin flip of coming out of it alive.**There are a few things Aurora Rising does relatively well—from its sturdy premise to its attempts at subverting well-worn tropes (though some elements wind up being huge red herrings) to even some finer points of morality and responsibility pulsing beneath the surface (the novel, however, allows them very little space to grow a thematic argument of any complexity)—but being a gripping read isn't one of them.As bursting with enthusiasm as Aurora Rising is, not all of the authors' choices pan out. The novel is overstuffed with sci-fi spectacle, little of it being particularly fresh. The story sprints past most of its poignant moments to unrelentingly pursue the next plot objective instead, which comes at the cost of a winning story. The plot feels rushed, and the many point-of-view characters are flattened by so little page-time, and regularly cutting to some of them didn’t feel organic either. I soon found myself becoming indifferent to them (except maybe Finian whose shoulders must be strained from hefting the weight of this entire book). I simply didn’t care. I didn’t care so profoundly that a well of cynicism rose in me, and the boredom of it all almost bled my brain front to back. It doesn’t do the story any favors that the book's entire narrative bends towards an ending that's frustratingly glib, and it was all I could not to fling my kindle against the wall.Here is the thing: I signed up for a swashbuckling romp packed full with camaraderie, charisma and quick wit, featuring a crew of diverse misfits wrestling with rejection and the choices that got them into this mess in the first place. But Aurora Rising carries itself with nothing of the funny dialogue, and the yanked heartstring that made The Illuminae Files so winning. With an unexciting plot, characters that are as compelling as a wet ball of yarn, relationships that have zero chemistry (you have SEVEN characters and you decide to pair them all into heterosexual ships? Please. I am bored. I feel like yawning. I am already yawning), and girl-on-girl hate that outstayed the acceptable page limit by a factor of at least three, this novel was a huge let down.You’d think some cosmic authority would put a limit on how many disappointments one gets in a lifetime, but oh well.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30075662-aurora-rising
Acceptance;Jeff VanderMeer;2014;2010;341;3.64;68156;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];It is winter in Area X, the mysterious wilderness that has defied explanation for thirty years, rebuffing expedition after expedition, refusing to reveal its secrets. As Area X expands, the agency tasked with investigating and overseeing it—the Southern Reach—has collapsed on itself in confusion. Now one last, desperate team crosses the border, determined to reach a remote island that may hold the answers they've been seeking. If they fail, the outer world is in peril.Meanwhile, Acceptance tunnels ever deeper into the circumstances surrounding the creation of Area X—what initiated this unnatural upheaval? Among the many who have tried, who has gotten close to understanding Area X—and who may have been corrupted by it?In this last installment of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, the mysteries of Area X may be solved, but their consequences and implications are no less profound—or terrifying.;I'm not sure why, but everything kind of fell apart for me on this one (and, looking over the reviews, I'm clearly in the minority on that.) The only story that was truly compelling to me was the Lightkeeper's. Otherwise it just felt like a race to wrap up different story threads and tie it with a bow. When you step back, not a whole lot of anything actually HAPPENS in this book. People walk around. Thoughts are processed. We flash back to the past. People marvel at Area X's oddness. They see an oddity. They process their thoughts about that oddity. They walk around some more. After the breath of fresh air of the first book and the deepening of the mystery in the second, this third book just left me disappointed.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077752-acceptance
Lock In;John Scalzi;2014;2010;336;3.91;68045;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Audiobook', 'Thriller', 'Crime', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"Not too long from today, a new, highly contagious virus makes its way across the globe. Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the United States alone - the disease causes ""Lock In"": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge.A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as ""Haden's syndrome,"" rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an ""integrator"" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.But ""complicated"" doesn't begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. The world of the locked in is changing, and with the change comes opportunities that the ambitious will seize at any cost. The investigation that began as a murder case takes Shane and Vann from the halls of corporate power to the virtual spaces of the locked in, and to the very heart of an emerging, surprising new human culture. It's nothing you could have expected.";"I've read pretty much everything John Scalzi has written at this point, so when I pick up one of his books, I don't expect anything in particular. I just know he's going to take me somewhere, and I trust that he's going to make the ride a pleasant one. Even so, I was a little surprised by this book. In some ways it's sci-fi but not rocketships-and-lasers sci-fi. In other ways it's a mystery, but not the Victorian-style Sherlock sort of thing. It's also kind of a police procedural. Maybe a bit of a... thriller? I dunno... Honestly, I'd hesitate to classify this book as one particular thing, which means it's sufficiently complex to be a story in its own right, and not just some generic genre knock-off. A good thing. In a change of pace for me, I didn't read the texty print version of this book. Instead I listened to the Audiobook narrated by Amber Benson. That added a lot to the experience for me, and made me realize just how far I have to go as a narrator myself. And I don't mean that I listened to it, thinking ""Yay! I love Amber Benson!"" (Though I do.) She's a much better narrator than that, her own voice doesn't intrude into the story. The truth is, I constantly *forgot* she was the one narrating it. That's impressive skill at work. Was the book worth my time? Absolutely. Like all good speculative fiction it started with an interesting premise and followed that premise through to to reasonable but unexpected permutations. It's clever, thoughtful, funny, and had some good action to boot. P.S. Scalzi did something interesting with the audio of this book, and had *two* versions recorded. One read by Amber Benson. One read by Wil Wheaton. Has anyone out there listened to the Wheaton version? Or both of them? How do they compare?";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21418013-lock-in
More Than This;Patrick Ness;2013;2010;480;3.95;67276;no;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery'];A boy drowns, desperate and alone in his final moments. He dies. Then he wakes, naked and bruised and thirsty, but alive. How can this be? And what is this strange deserted place?As he struggles to understand what is happening, the boy dares to hope. Might this not be the end? Might there be more to this life, or perhaps this afterlife?From multi-award-winning Patrick Ness comes one of the most provocative and moving novels of our time.;"this book treated me like a dog treats a ragdoll. and i have no idea where to begin. patrick ness has written a game-changer that i'm not even really sure how to approach. this is a YA novel. i've lost half of you book snobs right there. but i think that is my point. YA has been breaking free of its presumed confines for years. when i was a teen, YA novels were largely disposable, empty-calorie entertainment trifles meant to keep us off the streets, off drugs, and not full of babies. they were either morally-didactic or cheesy horror-mysteries with very little intellectual fiber. and when i finally came around on the contemporary YA fiction bandwagon, i was impressed with both the variety of topics and treatment of those topics and most importantly, the range of sophistication of the writing itself. sure, loads of them are still silly and forgettable, but there are also complete gems of books out there for stronger, smarter teen readers looking to be exposed to something new, something challenging.and this book delivers that with a brainpunch i'm still feeling.this is how i felt after i read beauty queens, after i read piper's son,which while they are COMPLETELY different kinds of books, did things to me that i didn't think could still be done to me, not in YA anyway. which sounds like i am undermining what i just sad about YA-sophistication, but my reaction to these titles is more about my being completely knocked off-balance as a reader, and at having my expectations about the book completely rocked, but also my expectations about what books could be.does that make sense? because it's not that i am impressed that there are well written YA books out there - i'm beyond that realization. this is something more fundamentally mind-blowing.i promise there is a review coming, but i really gotta work through this here. i'm all gobsmacked.beauty queens stunned me by not being, as i had expected, about a bunch of lovely and spoiled girls going all lord of the flies and killing each other on a deserted island after a plane crash. in fact, it was the complete opposite of that storyline, which forced me to question what that said about me that i wanted that story in the first place, and brought a little tear to my soul and stirred up all the sisterhood feelings all bottled up in me. piper's son redefined the boundaries of YA commercially by having one of the two main characters be a fifty-something woman experiencing her first pregnancy. and it redefined the boundaries for me personally because it made me cry. and that doesn't happen.and this one. this one just takes genre and convention and coyly toys with it. when you think you know what is going on, when the characters think they know what is gong on, that's when things start to go all slipstream on you.more than this is like a giant book-jenga, with different kinds of books making up its tower, and just when you think you know what you are reading, that darn patrick ness will change the game slightly, yanking out a piece of the puzzle, slyly addressing what he is doing and what he is not doing and what he could be doing and letting the reader know that he knows what they are thinking, but think again, please! it is an aftermath novel. it is an afterlife novel. it is an afterlove novel. it is an afterloss novel. he pulls and teases and backtracks and sidetracks in this elegant dance of misdirection and metafiction.and then he does the unthinkable! and it's hard to even tiptoe around, and it may not count as spoiler but basically - nothing you think as a reader matters. the story itself does not matter. it's all just perception and opinion and ""Oh, forget it,"" he says with feeling. ""Nobody knows anything.""AND THAT IS ULTIMATE MINDFUNKERY!! and it becomes this crazytime philosophical and humanist exercise, but like if solipsistic humanism was a thing, you know? it blows my freaking mind with all my brainparts that still cannot comprehend that this is a freaking YA book.also - tomasz is the new manchee. and i love him.i can't do anything for this book. it's too much in my heart right now.come to my blog!!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21969786-more-than-this

Max's desperate desire to protect Fang brings the two closer than ever. But can the team weather the storm, or will the turmoil rip them apart for the last time?;If Fang dies, I'm going to make Patterson rewrite the book. I really will. Fang dying would screw up the series, and unless Angel gains the power to bring back the dead, Fang HAS TO STAY ALIVE! Fax is one of the BEST parts of this series! Particularly since the Erasers, and the School and all those people either don't exist or aren't interested in them anymore. The series was better when the Flock was running.*later*I have been reading reviews. And it is unanimous. (Or at least it should be.) FANG. CAN. NOT. DIE. We should email Patterson about how Fang can't die.*even later*Okay, I looked at this book on Patterson's webite-AND FANG IS GOING TO BE REPLACED BY DYLAN, A BIRD KID RAISED TO BE MAX'S PERFECT OTHER HALF. Therefore, I'm going to buy it and skip to the end to make sure Dylan dies and Fang doesn't.*even later than even later*I know what happens in this one and in Angel now. *Barfs loudly and violently and a lot and then sobs.* Bleh.

Blood Red Road;Moira Young;2011;2010;459;3.91;61885;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Adventure'];Saba has spent her whole life in Silverlake, a dried-up wasteland ravaged by constant sandstorms. The Wrecker civilization has long been destroyed, leaving only landfills for Saba and her family to scavenge from. That's fine by her, as long as her beloved twin brother Lugh is around. But when four cloaked horsemen capture Lugh, Saba's world is shattered, and she embarks on a quest to get him back.Suddenly thrown into the lawless, ugly reality of the outside world, Saba discovers she is a fierce fighter, an unbeatable survivor, and a cunning opponent. Teamed up with a handsome daredevil named Jack and a gang of girl revolutionaries called the Free Hawks, Saba's unrelenting search for Lugh stages a showdown that will change the course of her own civilization.;As seen on The ReadventurerThis book is not going to be out until June, so I feel very lucky for having had an opportunity to read it so early. I hope it will get enough promo buzz over the next few months to reach tons of readers, because Blood Red Road very much deserves it. It is a stand-out in the new crop of dystopian/post-apocalyptic YA fiction, most of which is crap.The novel is basically an adventure quest set in a distant post-apocalyptic future. Saba's twin brother Lugh is kidnapped in front of her eyes. Why and where he is taken, Saba doesn't know, but she is determined to do everything she can to find and rescue him. Obstacles and adventures are ahead of her.I quite liked Saba. There is a bit of Katniss Everdeen in her - that familiar determination, stubbornness, strength, charisma and heightened survival instincts. In fact, Blood Red Road is a celebration of girl power. You will not see a single limp damsel in distress in this novel. Women here, regardless of their age, are strong and self-reliant and, surprisingly, they don't waste their time on trying to prove they have balls to the men around them by wearing pants and rejecting everything feminine. They simply are women and they kick ass. No gender politics and struggles here. Very refreshing.What else is great about the book it the writing style. I am guessing it will be a hit or miss with the readers. Saba lives in a world where almost all traces of civilization are gone. She can't read or write, so her narrating style consists of abrupt, grammatically-incorrect sentences. Somehow it adds character to Saba's voice and urgency to the story itself. The pacing of this novel is fast and it is never boring.On the other hand, I agree with other reviewers who think the first part of the novel is stronger than the second. Very true. The first half is intense and suspenseful, colored by Saba's single desire to save her brother. The second half is still well-paced, but is diluted by rather predictable plot twists and formulaic romantic back and forth. Although I won't be complaining about romance for too long. I would have been upset if there was none and the main male squeeze is a cool, likable dude. Sufficiently hot make-out sessions were greatly appreciated as well.All in all, I am left with a feeling that the beginning of the novel indicated that the book would be something more ambitious, something more important and meaningful. What it is is a well-written, fast paced adventure-type commercial teen fiction which is not such a bad thing IMO. Blood Red Road might not be my favorite book in the dystopian/post-apocalyptic genre, but it is definitely one of the better ones. I look forward to reading the next two books in this promising new trilogy.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9917938-blood-red-road

The Fireman;Joe Hill;2016;2010;768;3.91;61289;no;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Dystopia'];"From the award-winning, New York Times bestselling author of NOS4A2 and Heart-Shaped Box comes a chilling novel about a worldwide pandemic of spontaneous combustion that threatens to reduce civilization to ashes and a band of improbable heroes who battle to save it, led by one powerful and enigmatic man known as the Fireman.The fireman is coming. Stay cool.No one knows exactly when it began or where it originated. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one: Boston, Detroit, Seattle. The doctors call it Draco Incendia Trychophyton. To everyone else it’s Dragonscale, a highly contagious, deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodies—before causing them to burst into flames. Millions are infected; blazes erupt everywhere. There is no antidote. No one is safe.Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now she’s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected. To Jakob’s dismay, Harper wants to live—at least until the fetus she is carrying comes to term. At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror. The chaos gives rise to ruthless Cremation Squads—armed, self-appointed posses roaming the streets and woods to exterminate those who they believe carry the spore. But Harper isn’t as alone as she fears: a mysterious and compelling stranger she briefly met at the hospital, a man in a dirty yellow fire fighter’s jacket, carrying a hooked iron bar, straddles the abyss between insanity and death. Known as The Fireman, he strolls the ruins of New Hampshire, a madman afflicted with Dragonscale who has learned to control the fire within himself, using it as a shield to protect the hunted . . . and as a weapon to avenge the wronged.In the desperate season to come, as the world burns out of control, Harper must learn the Fireman’s secrets before her life—and that of her unborn child—goes up in smoke.";"The people in charge can always justify doing terrible things in the name of the greater good. A slaughter here, a little torture there. It becomes moral to do things that would be immoral if an ordinary individual did ‘em.
They have been trying to take us down for quite a while. Some may enjoy the end of the world (EotW) arriving in the form of an incoming asteroid. Hey, it worked for the dinosaurs. Alien invasion is always popular. Very big in the 50s, whether by maleficent alien civilizations or maybe a nice juicy mobile plant of the triffid variety. Viruses have been pretty big the last few decades, global pandemics, whether of alien or Terran origin. Zombie apocalypse is all the rage today, whether the zombies are animated by a force of nature or not. How an author takes us from the pre-disaster here through the horrors to there, wherever or whenever there may be, is the fun. But many of these entertainments carry a stowaway. EotW tales exist not only to titillate, and elevate our blood pressure, but to deliver a core of perspective along with the fun. The collapse of civilization is a favorite mechanism for writers looking at the core of human nature. Imaginative tales go to extremes to point out things about the here and now. Joe Hill - from USA TodayJoe Hill has come up with a truly ingenious mechanism for bringing about his apocalyptic vision. Draco incendia trychophyton is a spore with some unusual properties. (smoothly rolling off the tongue not being one of them) The skin of people who have been exposed to it erupts in what looks like burger meat that has been way, way overcooked, interspersed with lines of gold. The affliction comes to be called “Dragonscale,” or ‘scale for short. It gets worse. Not long after initial exposure, most of the afflicted spontaneously combust. The spore spreads like wildfire, and soon the entire world is ablaze. This Freightliner snow plow could be better called a Frightliner for its use here Harper Grayson, a school nurse, is practically perfect in every way. She is both kind and firm with her young patients, an admirable combination she employs when dealing with adults as well. Her hero is, of course, Mary Poppins. Throughout the 747 pages of this book (the page count may vary with the edition), there are many references to P.L. Travers’ magical nanny, too many to list here. But you should know that Harper totes her belongings in a carpet bag, once had a dog named Bert, and in the imagined film of the story of her life, she wants to be played by Julie Andrews. In an interview for his last book, Hill said
 I was thinking about Lon Chaney who had line about, “There’s nothing funny about a clown at midnight.” I think that’s part of the horror writer’s job: to create unsettling juxtapositions. You find something that seems harmless and innocent, and pair it with aspects that are disturbing. Christmas is a joyous occasion, it’s a time of pleasure and family, but there’s something about Christmas songs in the middle of the summer that’s not quite right.- from Nightmare Magazine interviewThe juxtaposition of Harper’s Disney-ish aspect, which stops just short of animated bluebirds chirping away on her shoulders, adds a nice dollop of sweet to the sour of the apocalyptic landscape. Harper and her husband, Jakob, have talked about ending their lives themselves rather than burning to death like the Dragonscale sufferers. But when she discovers that she is pregnant, the appearance of tell-tale black-and-gold on her skin presents not a death sentence, but a challenge. She has seen ‘scaled mothers deliver uninfected babies, and hopes she can too. Jakob has other plans. The Fireman of the title is John Rookwood. Harper first encounters him when he insists on crashing the very long line outside the hospital where she is working, (after the school has been shut down) carrying a boy with a severe illness. Later, as vigilante groups spring up to exterminate the infected, so-called Cremation Squads, he leads her to a place of safety. John’s talents extend beyond being handy with a halligan, being kind and protective toward children, and looking steamy in a yellow slicker. He can control his dragonscale, and do some pretty interesting things with it. You wouldn’t want to make his blood boil. John still carries a torch, though, for his old flame.  It may not be a roque mallet, but John’s halligan comes in pretty handyThe Fireman can be read on at least two levels. On the surface, this is a can’t-put-it-down amazing scifi/horror adventure, a barn-burner of a read, exciting, fun, and very, very scary. It will keep you flipping the pages so fast you might generate sparks. (I recommend reading with a glass or bottle of non-alcoholic liquid near to hand) Harper is a wonderful character. I mean, really, a young nurse, pregnant, fleeing dark forces, while trying to figure out how dragonscale works and how it might be controlled, a woman who is the epitome of cheerful and positive, in a very bleak time, just hoping to live long enough to deliver her baby into the hands of people who can care for him or her. Add a damaged hero in John, an ally who can help her find a haven, if one really exists, but who comes with a bucket brigade of baggage. Good guys, bad guys and plenty in-between, a lot of action and a wealth of creativity. All that said, there is something more going on here. This is not just some cozy catastrophe in which a group of survivors carve out a manageable modus vivendi in the shadow of global horror. Hill is not only looking to give his readers a good scare. He wants to offer something more substantive. The Fireman delivers what the best speculative fiction provides, a look at contemporary reality through the lens of fantasy. John brings Harper to a place where others with ‘scale have come together, for group support and defense. The place is called Camp Wyndham. And for those to whom the name is unfamiliar, it might help to know that John Wyndham was the author of a 1957 novel, The Midwich Cuckoos. You might know it better as the film Village of the Damned. The lovely kids in this tale, of dubious parentage, are possessed of a group consciousness. Members of the Camp Wyndham community, all with ‘scale, have found that under certain circumstances the spore allows them to join into a joyous group rapture they call The Bright. This entails a loss of self, which not everyone is all that thrilled about, somewhere between the ecstatic experience of a full-bore revival meeting and a hive mind. Hill also references Jack Finney’s book, made into multiple film versions, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers
Carol said, “Sometimes when I’m in The Bright, I would swear I feel my [late] sister standing right next to me, close enough so I could lay my head on her shoulder, like I used to. When we shine, they all come back to us, you know. The light we make together shows everything that was ever lost to the darkness.Harper clamped down on a shudder. When they spoke of The Bright, they had all the uncomplicated happiness of pod people.
 When we lose ourselves in a group-think situation, morality goes out the window. Why have a head at all if you only use it to ditto someone else’s psychotic rage? The relevance to our world is blazingly clear, whether the group be political or religious. There be dragons there. And there is a very real question of whether cooler heads will prevail.There is consideration as well of how people reach out to help those in pain or in danger. Maybe like the way Chris Christie locked up a nurse returning to the USA after she had been helping Ebola victims in Africa. In addition to seeing the ‘scalers as infected, see them as unwanted immigrants, as a despised class. See them as Syrian refugees fleeing civil war. See them as Costa Rican children fleeing north to keep from being forcibly drafted into drug gangs. Even a Trump-sized wall cannot keep out a global pandemic. Fear can usually be counted on to drown out most kinder impulses, often with the assistance of small arms. We get a taste of this here, as Cremation Squads do for spore victims what the SS did for Jews and others, or what, I am sure, many Tea-Baggers and militia groups would love to do to progressives, immigrants, members of the LGBT community, and ethnic and religious minorities here in the USA. Erstwhile residents of Auschwitz might recognize how some of the constabulary treat their prisoners in Hill’s dark landscape. All the nastiness is done with the eager support and encouragement, even participation, of a particularly sociopathic hate radio jock, broadcasting on a radio station with appropriate call letters. Hill tips his hat to luminary writers who have written about despotism and apocalypse. In addition to John Wyndham, noted above, a boat is named for Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid’s Tale and the MaddAddam series. Nobel laureate Alexander Solzhenitsyn, author of The Gulag Archipelago gets a mention, as does Cormac McCarthy, for The Road. There are almost certainly more of these.Over his entire oeuvre, Hill has demonstrated considerable glee in referencing the popular culture in which he was raised. MTV VJ Martha Quinn gets a lot of ink. Song, TV and movie references abound. But his largest source of material here is Disney. The Mary Poppins references in support of Harper’s character are legion. But there are plenty of others, including Toy Story, and a somewhat more oblique reference to Pinocchio. A ref to a classic Coke commercial also resonates, creepily. He even references his own work a bit. I spotted one link to NOS4A2, but I bet there are plenty more. I did not check the DNA of character names against the Stephen-King-Joe-Hill-character-database (there probably is one) of names used in their books, but generally, Joe has taken to tossing in refs to his dad’s work. These are always fun to spot. The writing of one particular character here is very reminiscent of Jack Torrance’s magnum opus in The Shining. Not so much the form, but the impact, and the revelation it contains about that character. As with the haunted Torrance, this guy blames others for all his problems. And shining is referenced as well, although of a sort different from that possessed by Danny at the Overlook, when the Camp Wyndham folks link up in The Bright. Hill has even said of The Fireman “it’s my version of The Stand, soaked in gasoline and set on fire.” So what comes next? Fire is often used as a cleansing image, in nature and religion. Burning the earth, as Maine, and the world, is scorched, may allow new growth, in the same way that new growth arrived in the years after Mount St Helen’s blew. Is that a factor here? Cleaning via fire so something new can grow? I won’t burn the ending for you, but it did suggest that Hill will be adding some logs to the flames of this story in future volumes. No inside intel, just a guess. I am tempted to suggest that readers of The Fireman will feel the burn, but that might imply that Hill has indicated a preference in the Democratic primary for Bernie Sanders. He has not. But I can say that The Fireman is certain to be both one of the hottest books of the year, and one of the coolest.Review posted March 25, 2016Publication date – May 7, 2016=============================EXTRA STUFFIn the epigraph to the novel. Hill includes three diverse quotes, one from Springsteen, one from Mary Poppins, and one from Fahrenheit 451. All were sources of inspiration.

A Memory Called Empire;Arkady Martine;2019;2010;448;4.12;60674;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Audiobook'];Ambassador Mahit Dzmare arrives in the center of the multi-system Teixcalaanli Empire only to discover that her predecessor, the previous ambassador from their small but fiercely independent mining Station, has died. But no one will admit that his death wasn't an accident—or that Mahit might be next to die, during a time of political instability in the highest echelons of the imperial court.Now, Mahit must discover who is behind the murder, rescue herself, and save her Station from Teixcalaan's unceasing expansion—all while navigating an alien culture that is all too seductive, engaging in intrigues of her own, and hiding a deadly technological secret—one that might spell the end of her Station and her way of life—or rescue it from annihilation.;"There is a scene near the beginning of A Memory Called Empire that I remember reading with so much clarity. In the scene, the protagonist Mahit Dzmare, ambassador from the (tenuously) independent Lsel station to the empire of Teixcalaan, is introduced by her cultural liaison to a crowd of Teixcalaanli literati during an imperial banquet: 
She could follow about half of the allusions and quotations that slipped in and out of their speech. It made her jealous in a way she recognized as childish: the dumb longing of a noncitizen to be acknowledged as a citizen. Teixcalaan was made to instill the longing, not to satisfactorily resolve it, she knew that. And yet it wormed into her every time she bit her tongue, every time she didn’t know a word or the precise connotations of a phrase.
 I was immediately struck by a powerful sense of recognition. These few sentences handed me a vocabulary for a hitherto inexpressible private reality: standing “in the midst of the sharp chatter of ambitious young people” who look nothing like me, who speak effortlessly in a language that was not native to me and was therefore still twisting my tongue into spirals, and being aware, to an almost abject degree, of the incalculable distance that separated me from them. This is a feeling I would come to know, as a post-colonial immigrant student, as a hard and brutal thing: the engulfing sense of being somehow diminished, of being rendered abruptly unreal, disconnected, and—in some inconsolable way—depersonalized. I felt seen in ways I found difficult to explain a few years ago, when I read this book for the first time.The conflicts of displacement and (un)belongingness are still open and devastatingly familiar to many immigrants today. I’ve never had any illusions about being unique in this. But, years later, it is not the aching deprived longing for acknowledgement from the center—the “dumb longing of a noncitizen to be acknowledged as a citizen” in Mahit’s terms—that smashes into me as if it is newly wrought. It is rather the icy realization of how this longing ultimately fulfills an important function for empire: it is a form of internalized belief in imperial superiority constructed and maintained by the center to embed and ensure the subordination of the margins. It is, in other words, simultaneously a reminder that we will never be good enough to reach complete and unconditional belongingness—that we are always going to be marginal—and an invitation to strive for it anyway.This is, to borrow some of the author's own words, both “the seduction and horror of empire.” I understand this today in ways I couldn’t wrap words around two years ago: that this longing for belonging—precisely by virtue of being subtle, pervasive, conditioned, and falsely innocuous—is perhaps the most effective and enduring brutality of imperialism. Furthermore, that the work of decolonization cannot, and will not, begin without first taking a long, hard look at one’s own hunger for the center.This is, of course, easier said than done. To confront one’s own colonization is an act like forcing poison from a wound: painful, no matter how utterly necessary. This is a central point of tension in A Memory Called Empire. The protagonist, Mahit Dzmare, arrives as an international ambassador to the imperial City of Teixcalaan with clear-cut instructions from her home Station of Lsel: investigate the sudden death of her predecessor, advocate for Lsel citizens, and—at whatever cost—prevent the absorption of Lsel into the all-devouring empire of Teixcalaan. This arrival, however, has the added effect of setting into motion a reckoning over Mahit’s self-confessed infatuation with Teixcalaanli culture, her internalization of Teixcalaanli ideas of superiority and inferiority—what constitutes “citizens” and “barbarians” for Teixcalaan—and the dangerous implications those have for the safety and continuity of Mahit’s homeland and culture. Mahit grew up with dreams of Teixcalaan. She spent her youth studying every inch of Teixcalaanli culture, memorizing Teixcalaanli poems, and trying out the rhythms and cadences of Teixcalaanli language until they moved the right way on her tongue. Her position as an ambassador was, in fact, obtained due to this cultivated familiarity with Teixcalaan, a closeness disdainfully characterized at one point in the novel by Mahit’s superiors as a “xenophilic love” for a heritage that was not their own, a diseased way of thinking that made her both undeniably useful for her homeland of Lsel—and potentially dangerous. However, this dream Teixcalaan—the Teixcalaan Mahit hankered for—quickly slips away when confronted with the reality of Teixcalaan, the Teixcalaan that is unfiltered through language and literature and poetry, the “poison gifts” of empire.Immediately upon her arrival, Mahit hits several walls of institutional indifference, hostility and neglect that demolish, in increments, the illusion (and possibility) of belongingness. Despite her aptitude for Teixcalaanli literature that equaled that of any Teixcalaanli-born citizen, Mahit becomes increasingly aware of endless chasms opening up between her and the rest of the Teixcalaanlitzlim. The dose of othering delivered to Mahit in the scene that opens this review is replicated both in text and in conversations throughout A Memory Called Empire. The first Teixcalaanli citizen Mahit meets upon her arrival in Teixcalaan is her cultural liaison, Three Seagrass, who, Mahit immediately notes, wears a glass device over her left eye called “a cloudhook.” Only imperial citizens are allowed access to this cloudhook, and by extension, to the imperial information network that flows through it, and which facilitates the lives of Teixcalaanli citizens, connecting them to the empire and to each other. A few pages later, Three Seagrass pointedly reminds Mahit: “You don’t have a cloudhook. You can’t open some doors, Ambassador. The City doesn’t know you’re real.” (31) The City doesn’t know you’re real. Mahit is quite literally invisible in the eyes of empire, her erasure so rigorous that she is no longer real. Thus denuded of that single device which singles belongingness, visibility, and legitimacy, Mahit is forced to walk through Teixcalaan shaped and reshaped every single moment around the knowledge that she is not a citizen, and therefore she is not real. It is a realization Mahit has to constantly deal with, an adjustment to be made over and over again. This displacement is further intensified by the fact that Mahit’s positionality as a “barbarian” in Teixcalaan’s eyes not only disallows her access and participation in imperial rites and rituals, but also exorcises her from the category of “human” by Teixcalaanli definition: “the physiologies of noncitizens […] are quite different from human people! Not that I’m implying Lsel Station isn’t human, Ambassador, nothing of the kind. But I am insatiably curious.”This deliberate withholding from belongingness is also effectively reproduced in Teixcalaanli language which is filled with labyrinthine twistings and symbolic valence imbued into the smallest epithet, the smallest gesture (“Allusions and references were the center of Teixcalaanli high culture”). Faced with the uncomprehending and incomprehensible gaze of Teixcalaan, and her own helpless sense of inadequacy, Mahit often has to rely on her cultural liaison, Three Seagrass, to translate Teixcalaan to her and translate her to Teixcalaan. Over time, this dependency brings home to Mahit most sharply, most potently, the fact that Teixcalaan-born citizens will always be more Teixcalaanli than her, no matter how high she scored in Teixcalaanli examinations, or “how much poetry she memorized.” In fact, trying to be up close to Teixcalaan only reminds Mahit of her distance from it, longing highlighted by the specter of its unattainability. In other words, Mahit will never be Teixcalaanli, and she will “never stop knowing it.”This endlessly complicated dynamics of fragmentation is made even more fraught in the novel by the fact that Mahit seems to have a growing acute sense of its presence and implications. She is not a racialized subject who has swallowed empire’s ideals and assertions as incontrovertible truths, nor is she blind to the seduction of empire and to the dazzling inappropriateness of falling for it. “Teixcalaan was made to instill the longing, not to satisfactorily resolve it,” Mahit knows this, and throughout the novel, she heartbreakingly attempts to transform that longing into an inoffensive fact that she can harbor within herself without either disowning it or suffering from it. “Be a mirror,” she desperately repeats to herself at one point, “be a mirror when you meet a knife; be a mirror when you meet a stone. Be as Teixcalaanli as you can, and be as Lsel as you can, and—oh, fuck, breathe. That too.” Perhaps nowhere else is this struggle clearer in the novel than in this desperate, broken mantra: the soul-crushing difficulty of negotiating liminal spaces and fraught hyphenated realities, made sharper by the absolute necessity of it for the sake of one’s survival.At the close of the novel, to be truly Teixcalaanli seems more and more an irretrievable possibility, and the longer Mahit stays in Teixcalaan, belonging to Lsel becomes just as inconceivable, as if Mahit had already crossed to the other side of some tremendous divide, a zone of no-return. Mahit eventually concludes with an aching finality that “nothing touched by empire stays clean,” a poetic confession of the agony of trying to articulate the nuanced reality of being “Other”, of being condemned to an existence in which you are neither here nor there, too much of this and never enough of that. For Mahit, this reckoning rings with layers upon layers of difficult choices, every single one of them infused, inconsolably, with a sense of loss, the knowledge that Teixcalaan and Lsel will always fight for the same room inside Mahit’s life, half of her both at war with and longing for the other half: “Mahit felt that way now, as Lsel came back into the center of her ship’s viewports. Very distant. A certain kind of free. Not, in the end, quite home.”At bottom remains for Mahit the fact that once you leave, you can’t really be home again; not all the way anyway, no matter how hard you try. Once you leave, something is lost and I don’t know if you can ever find it again. If you’re lucky, like Mahit, you might “never stop knowing it,” for it is precisely in that knowingness, no matter how painful, that a reckoning with (if not outright repudiation of) any diseased longing for empire—the first gesture at real decolonization—can truly begin.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37794149-a-memory-called-empire

Bob and his copies have been spreading out from Earth for 40 years now, looking for habitable planets. But that's the only part of the plan that's still in one piece. A system-wide war has killed off 99.9% of the human race; nuclear winter is slowly making the Earth uninhabitable; a radical group wants to finish the job on the remnants of humanity; the Brazilian space probes are still out there, still trying to blow up the competition; And the Bobs have discovered a spacefaring species that sees all other life as food.  Bob left Earth anticipating a life of exploration and blissful solitude. Instead he's become a sky god to a primitive native species, the only hope for getting humanity to a new home, and possibly the only thing that can prevent every living thing in the local sphere from ending up as dinner.";Away from the only, poor single, Bob technobabble focus towards more characterizations, interactions with real humans, implications, and open questions about consciousness, love, and immortality with a little portion of apocalypse and space warfare. Do you wanna live foreverAs soon as it´s technically possible, a Bob simply cannot die, except she/he is so lazy to keep no backups and have an adrenaline junkie problem at the same time, although there is nobody anymore and the reactions have to be activated. But the fact that a kind of neural correlate of consciousness and personality, a digital mini me, could realistically be constructed after the impossible task of getting the data and working algorithms out of freaking annoying meatspace, is mindblowing.  How much should I uplift you? More stone age tribe pimpingThat´s always tricky, because playing around with the prime directive means many duties and less fun, because these stupid aliens don´t do what one wants. They don´t cry for help, instead, they tell one to go home, have their own ideas, keep following the same stupid ideologies and systems humans used to have for long periods of time too. All in all, it´s stress and could be compared to having unthankful kids who both don´t follow orders and have own imaginations about what to do with their life. Terrible. Space warfare against the dark macho forceThat´s just a little, conventional aspect of the whole thing, but the fact that the war machinery is the main protagonist and can optimize its killing ability to a level even pure AIs might not be able to, is an interesting, fresh sci fi aspect. Because there are many collective hive minds or evil insect queens controlling all of its minions, optional with some officers and generals with more activated brainpower in between or bred less degenerate than the worthless cannon fodder warrior caste, but no democratic collective of many clones fighting in perfect coordination for altruistic reasons. If you´re into it, it´s okReal humans and love are already complicated enough, but as soon as androids, AIs, or copies of real humans get involved, it gets even more hard(ware)core or soft(ware)core, depending on the personal preferences. And don´t forget the nasty, conservative, intolerant relatives. This aspect will be examined in more detail in the third part of the series and has some unique thoughts that are the most outstanding elements of the series besides the many multiple mini me with evolving personalities, the consequences of digital immortality on society in general, and the ethical aspect of uplifting. Although they are more of an easygoing side plot without as many philosophical and societal questions, in contrast to how relationships will evolve as soon as mind uploading runs smoothly and any kind of body, gender, or animal can be chosen to mate with.

From the slew of 4 & 5* reviews already on show I may be out on a limb on this one - so don't listen to me - give it a try.-------------Collaboration. It’s a word with an unfortunate aftertaste. Collaborators get a bad rap. Sir Terry Pratchett’s collaborations with other notable authors have been limited. In 1990 we saw Good Omens, produced with Neil Gaiman. On the crest of that success Pratchett found another partner in Larry Niven but this effort floundered with Niven producing Rainbow Mars in 1999 as a solo work built upon some of their shared ideas. And now 2012 sees The Long Earth, a collaboration with Stephen Baxter. The accompanying promotion contains a photo of the two grandees locked in combat before a laden bookshelf. A certain degree of dynamic tension does help in collaborative writing, too little and you get compromise writing, too much and it’s never going to get finished. I think here both men were pulling punches and the pages could have benefited from a good blooding!	Collaborations can be port and stilton good, or marmite and custard bad. I suspect it’s impossible for two fine writers like Baxter and Pratchett to serve up anything wholly unpalatable, but the Long Earth feels long, although it is short, and is decidedly blah. Think porridge.	The Long Earth is science fiction. In science fiction the IDEA tends to overshadow the characters and even the story. Here the IDEA has flattened both. Glimpses of story and character may be seen poking out from the margins of the IDEA, vital juices pooling. You can’t see much but you can see enough to know you don’t need an ambulance.	The Terry Pratchett of Discworld fame has not shown up to this party. There’s rarely a smile in The Long Earth, and never a laugh. The idea explored is that Earth sits in one of an infinity of parallel universes and that these become opened up to humanity such that pretty much everyone can step through them like moving from one card to the next in a deck of cards. We get to hear a lot about the impact this has on humanity, both social and economic. Sometimes we hear this from characters who pop up and are not heard of again, giving the book a disjointed feel. Of the hundreds of thousands of Earths open to Joe Public almost all are Earth as it would have been without us. A lot of time is spent detailing minor evolutionary variations in the flora and fauna, to the point where you just don’t care about one more slightly smaller elephant or slightly uglier crocodile. A lot of time is spent hopping from one forest world to the next. It’s an idea that is interesting in a paragraph but becomes increasingly dull over 300 pages.	The writing, line by line, is fine. It lacks trade-mark Pratchett sharpness but it does the job. The story arching over chapters is . . . not gripping. There’s essentially no tension in it. Our heroes (a young man who is very good at moving through the worlds, and an artificial intelligence named Lobsang) are exploring, they don’t have any clear goals stated, nothing is after them, they have no serious problems, they don’t appear worried or even to care that much, and thus as a reader one tends to a similar disposition.	The book ends with a bang, but it’s a rather ineffectual one that is, like the bulk of the book, hard to care about. I’m a fan of Sir Terry’s work and I applaud his willingness to experiment with new styles and new writing partners. I hope he keeps doing it. I cannot though, hand on heart say I enjoyed this book. Not even a little.	 Edit: RIP Sir Terry - you left us many great books to remember you by.

Feed;Mira Grant;2010;2010;599;3.85;59712;yes;['Horror', 'Zombies', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Young Adult'];The year was 2014. We had cured cancer. We had beaten the common cold. But in doing so we created something new, something terrible that no one could stop. The infection spread, virus blocks taking over bodies and minds with one, unstoppable command: FEED. Now, twenty years after the Rising, bloggers Georgia and Shaun Mason are on the trail of the biggest story of their lives—the dark conspiracy behind the infected. The truth will get out, even if it kills them.;"This is not a zombie book, or at least not a zombie book in the way it is marketed. That's only part of the reason why this book pisses me off. It promises a zombie novel despite the fact literally hundreds of pages go by without seeing one. It kicks off with a bang and some zombie action and then that's it. When I buy a book on the understanding it's about zombies, I do actually expect to, you know, experience them. Mira Grant assumes otherwise. Two things that genuinely confused me; -- The pop culture references to the current world. Considering the fact this book is set 20 years in the future, in a completely different world and society and...people still remember Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Irwins are named after Steve Irwin, who, by the time all this takes place, is long dead. The whole George Romero thing irked me although I'm not really sure why. I understand his movies more or less catapulted zombies into mainstream culture but his most recent movies have flopped so hard people are wondering why he's still making them. I'm not ratting on the guy (Day Of The Dead was the movie that got me into zombies), I'm just saying I don't buy him having a god like status in society. -- The lack of anything sexual. Why? I'm not saying I expected it, or really that the book would have been better with some sex scenes but Grant avoided them to obviously, going as far as the categorically state both Georgia and Shaun are celibate with such abruptness my 'icky sex' radar went through the damn roof. It didn't help that she went to noticeable lengths to point out that they only needed each other, no one else under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I'm all for siblings being close but Grant failed massively and just made me suspicious some kind of relationship beyond brother/sister was going on. I was honestly expecting some kind of incest (they're adopted but have been brought up together. Not sure if that counts) subplot to come out and bite me. Georgia, for me, was a huge irritant. She was possibly an author insert and definitely a Mary Sue. She's awkward and hates the lime light yet gets lots of it, even though she tries her hardest to avoid any attention. She's the head of the team yet hates the recognition this gives her. She claims to deliver nothing but the truth, despite her blog posts being nothing but her opinion. She has an eye condition (another thing Grant doesn't let you forget) that means she's sensitive to light and can't go without her epic sunglasses. This takes nothing away from her appearance other than to make her look moody and cool. If my memory serves me right, someone even likens her to a rock star. On the occasions that she wears contact lenses, she wears bright blue colored ones so she can make people feel uncomfortable. Maybe Grant is under the illusion this is a flaw in some way (much like apparently being clumsy and falling over a lot is, ala Bella Swan) but it's obviously another way of showing how cool Georgia is. There was one passage when she even avoids a hug off of a well meaning woman who has been nothing other than kind to her because she didn't want to have to touch her/be touched. Hugs last about 3 seconds and she made it sound like touching this woman was akin to licking dog shit. What a rude dick. She cannot create good, believable characters. This is my biggest pet peeve. None of them (least of all Georgia and Shaun) can have a conversation without cracking juvenile one liners and generally showing how bad ass they are. And then there's the constant references to the blood testing kit. It was ok the first time, but 40th? Nope. I get it, it's a dangerous place to live (judging by the lack of zombie action, it's not really, but I'll pretend to go along with Mira anyway). I don't need to be constantly reminded every time they want to open a door. It's not like it's mentioned in detail the once, she go into detail every single time. The writing is repetitive to a point bordering on infuriating. If I had to read 'This is my brother Shaun, he pokes things with sticks!' one more time I probably would have burst a valve. She evens makes a reference to 'reaching for the stick' in the interview at the back. It wasn't funny the first time. Stop it. I really, genuinely do not like this book. The more I think about it the more it pisses me off. I'm sorry but I'm not buying any of it. Ps, the 'fictionals' made me want to smash my head off a wall. Wtf did she get that from? Pps, stereotyping and judging is not good, Mira. The only female politician is described as having big fake boobs, zero brain cells and no real talents other than squeezing her ta-ta's together. Whether or not that's Georgia with a case of The Bitchies I don't know, but it's not exactly fair and reeks of pathetic insecurity. The stereotyping? Oh dear. The only English character drops 'bloody hells' all over the place and has a blog called...'Fish & Clips'. I shit you not. Mira needs a holiday somewhere-outside-of-America.

A Thousand Pieces of You;Claudia Gray;2014;2010;368;3.9;59581;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Time Travel', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook'];Marguerite Caine's physicist parents are known for their groundbreaking achievements. Their most astonishing invention, called the Firebird, allows users to jump into multiple universes—and promises to revolutionize science forever. But then Marguerite's father is murdered, and the killer—her parent's handsome, enigmatic assistant Paul— escapes into another dimension before the law can touch him.Marguerite refuses to let the man who destroyed her family go free. So she races after Paul through different universes, always leaping into another version of herself. But she also meets alternate versions of the people she knows—including Paul, whose life entangles with hers in increasingly familiar ways. Before long she begins to question Paul's guilt—as well as her own heart. And soon she discovers the truth behind her father's death is far more sinister than she expected.;2.5*This is an interesting one to review. This is a case of this book just not being for me. It's very classic Twilight era style YA, featuring a love triangle and basically every other YA trope you can think of, including the male characters protecting the female character always *major eye roll*. That's the kind of stuff that I'm just no into anymore. Younger me would have swooned over this story, but now that I'm more of a mature reader, it doesn't appeal to me. It was too predictable, insta-lovey, and just overall too haven't I read this story before?However, speaking entirely objectively, if you are into the classic style YA, which there is absolutely nothing wrong if you are you read whatever makes you happy, I think you'd really enjoy this. The whole inter dimensional time travel scifi thing was well done, and it added a cool element to the story. The love triangle wasn't the worst I've read, and the writing was solid, cliches set aside. So if you're into that, this would be a great book for you!I absolutely adore the covers to this trilogy, but unfortunately I just didn't enjoy it enough to want to continue. Oh well, to each their own. P.S. I listened to the audiobook and that made my reading experience much more enjoyable, or else this likely would have been 2/5 stars.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17234658-a-thousand-pieces-of-you
Partials;Dan Wells;2012;2010;468;3.93;59027;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Romance'];Humanity is all but extinguished after a war with Partials—engineered organic beings identical to humans—has decimated the population. Reduced to only tens of thousands by a weaponized virus to which only a fraction of humanity is immune, the survivors in North America have huddled together on Long Island. But sixteen-year-old Kira is determined to find a solution. As she tries desperately to save what is left of her race, she discovers that that the survival of both humans and Partials rests in her attempts to answer questions about the war's origin that she never knew to ask.Playing on our curiosity of and fascination with the complete collapse of civilization, Partials is, at its heart, a story of survival, one that explores the individual narratives and complex relationships of those left behind, both humans and Partials alike—and of the way in which the concept of what is right and wrong in this world is greatly dependent on one's own point of view.Supports the Common Core State Standards.;"It seems as though YA Science Fiction is experiencing a bit of a resurgence lately. Like many other readers, I'm a little tired of the barely-dystopian trend, so it's great to see a very firmly science-oriented book like Partials come along. Airborne viruses + survivalist action drama + human interest story is a great combination, and one I think most fans of post-apocalyptic thrillers will enjoy. In the year 2076, 11 years after an airborne viral outbreak, the average newborn lives just 56 hours. 16-year-old Kira Walker, a young medic interning at a hospital, thinks that the key to human survival lies in studying Partials, a group of rogue cyborgs described as ""unthinking, unfeeling human killers."" Since Partials released the virus to begin with, surely they have the answers to a cure--whether it's through their genetic makeup or through their knowledge. When her friend Madison gets pregnant, Kira embarks on a dangerous mission: to find and capture a Partial so she can save her friend's child.But you've seen some positive reviews and some negative ones, right? So here is the type of person that I think will have a blast with this book.You're a Battlestar Galactica fan. There are many similar BSG elements in this book, in a very good way. Partials are very similar to Cylons, and there's a war between humans and Partials that will decide the fate of both. There are also some elements of Star Trek: TNG, and The Matrix in this book, which aren't bad influences to have at all. But lest you be concerned about knockoffs, this is definitely an original story, told in a very engaging way.You like medical thrillers. Kira runs a lot of tests on a captured Partial in this book, and while some readers may have an issue with all the medical business that goes on, I personally love books about viruses and analyses of scientific data, etc., so I very much enjoyed all that. Do Kira's experiments require some suspension of disbelief? Sure. Especially since a. she's a student b. we don't get all the answers we might be asking and c. this disease doesn't actually exist. (True story!) But what worked for me was that the author did a great job of walking us through the steps and logic and reasoning behind Kira's methodology.Post-apocalyptic books rock your socks. Something about this book reminded me a lot of the feel of Mira Grant's Feed and Deadline, but for the YA crowd--and I don't make those comparisons lightly. There is a great blend of virological talk, exciting action sequences, and entertaining twists and turns that will appeal to fans of the Newsflesh series. Plus there are some survivalist elements I also really enjoyed. Worrying about energy conservation, day to day needs, salvage runs? Please, tell me more!You appreciate butt-kicking heroines. I really liked Kira, who is a smart, responsible heroine, even if she is a little too narrowly focused on her ideals and a little too quick to fly off the handle. I would liked to have felt more of an emotional connection with her, the way I did with the very intriguing Samm who is SO much more interesting than the sweet but frustrating Marcus, but I did feel as though I understood her. And it's great to have a girl scientist portrayed in YA.Do any of these sound like you? If so, get thee to a bookstore and grab a copy of Partials asap!I will say that some of the secondary teen characters blended together for me, so that it wasn't until significant things happened to them that I remembered who was who and what part they were playing in the story. All the adults are there primarily to advance the plot as well, and basically serve as foils and obstacles to the teens. And even though it's understandable that teenagers have taken on more advanced roles earlier on due to the outbreak, they have such huge responsibilities that it does make you raise an eyebrow a bit; it's almost as if Partials was written with adult characters, but was adapted for the YA market. While some of the specifics of the story may strain credulity when you stop to look at the big picture, I have to admit that during reading, it's hard to care, because the story is so well-paced and entertaining. I'm hoping that in the sequel, we'll see deeper character development and further exploration of the ramifications of the Hope Act as the story continues.All in all, Partials was a lot of fun for me. My immediate reaction when I finished the book was ""fan-freaking-tastic!"" and I'm excited that there's such a great science fiction option out there for YA readers. Don't get me wrong, I love fluffy novels or the types of books that feature girls in pretty ballgowns. But I like the kind of girl who wears lab coats, doesn't mind risking her life for what she believes is right, and argues passionately about the civil rights of cyborgs, too.This review also appears in The Midnight Garden.

The Program;Suzanne Young;2013;2010;405;4.04;58394;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mental Health', 'Fantasy'];"In Sloane’s world, true feelings are forbidden, teen suicide is an epidemic, and the only solution is The Program.Sloane knows better than to cry in front of anyone. With suicide now an international epidemic, one outburst could land her in The Program, the only proven course of treatment. Sloane’s parents have already lost one child; Sloane knows they’ll do anything to keep her alive. She also knows that everyone who’s been through The Program returns as a blank slate. Because their depression is gone—but so are their memories.Under constant surveillance at home and at school, Sloane puts on a brave face and keeps her feelings buried as deep as she can. The only person Sloane can be herself with is James. He’s promised to keep them both safe and out of treatment, and Sloane knows their love is strong enough to withstand anything. But despite the promises they made to each other, it’s getting harder to hide the truth. They are both growing weaker. Depression is setting in. And The Program is coming for them.";"After having some time to think, i made the overall conclusion that this book is the most frustrating and saddest book i have ever read. 

The Program is set in a world where depression and suicide are considered a virus. If you are thought to have caught the virus, the handlers come to get you and take you to a facility known as The Program.

Little teaser..I look back at James one last time, and he gives me his signature smile, wide and cocky. But it's not real. Sometimes i think it's never real. James is the best at hiding the pain, disguising the feelings. He knows what it takes to stay out of The Program. He'll keep as safe. He promised. Sloane knows not to cry in front of anyone. One sign of sadness will land you straight into The Program. Her parents have already lost a child. She knows that anyone who returns comes back with no emotions - a blank slate. Their depression is gone, but so are their memories.

Under constant supervision and observation, Sloane puts on a mask, which she hides her feelings behind. James is the only one she let's in. She knows their love is strong enough to survive, to withstand anything. But despise the promises, it's getting harder to hide the truth. 

Depression is setting in. They're coming for them. It's only a matter of time before there'll be...nothing left. I have been crying my freaking eyes out since page 50- 160. And then from there on, i have been so frustrated and angry that i swear to God i could freaking see red. Having anger problems/issues it wasn't a good nor healthy idea for me to continue reading. But i couldn't stop. The writing style just pulls you in, and you have so many compassion and feelings for the characters you just have HAVE to know what will happen to them.Here are some examples of how i looked...



I didn't get angry at the book. Not really. It was mainly about the characters. I DESPISE reading about helpless characters that just can't fight back. I don't know. It was always my issue with things in general. I don't understand how you don't want to kill someone when they take your opportunities. When they take your freedom away. Especially when they tell you how to live your life. It's just so...AHHHH! *calm down, Sandra. Deep breaths*. If someone would hold me captive and force me to do things, i would fight until my very last breath. I would unleash the freaking hell on earth. I'm so not even kidding guys.The characters were great! Loved them! Especially James. 

 He was so sweet, funny, caring and protective. *swoon*. Sloane was a pretty good protagonist herself. But i must admit i was rather annoyed with her for being sometimes really naive and stupid. Especially about crying every freaking time she was reminded of her past. That was getting on my nerves. I think what was the best about this book was the romance between James and Sloane. It wasn't forced. It wasn't fast ( i mean, they are already together at the beginning). It was just...perfect. We get to see how they formed that relationship. We get to see the flashback, and i absolutely loved those moments. They are definitely the most beautiful, realistic and sweetest couple EVER.*sight*

Overall  The Program was a satisfying and captivating read. It was heart wrenching, frustrating to the point where i wanted to shred the book to pieces, and had beautifully written romance. I would highly suggest this to patient and strong minded people. If you have anger problems, make sure you don't read this! Also, this book was so depressing it got me depressed. Oooopps... i guess The Program will be coming for me..";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11366397-the-program
The City of Mirrors;Justin Cronin;2016;2010;602;4.21;57798;yes;['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Dystopia', 'Vampires'];The world we knew is gone. What world will rise in its place? The Twelve have been destroyed and the terrifying hundred-year reign of darkness that descended upon the world has ended. The survivors are stepping outside their walls, determined to build society anew—and daring to dream of a hopeful future. But far from them, in a dead metropolis, he waits: Zero. The First. Father of the Twelve. The anguish that shattered his human life haunts him, and the hatred spawned by his transformation burns bright. His fury will be quenched only when he destroys Amy—humanity’s only hope, the Girl from Nowhere who grew up to rise against him. One last time light and dark will clash, and at last Amy and her friends will know their fate.;I love Cronin’s epic story about a world destroyed by a virus that creates vampires. This is the third and final volume of his trilogy, so I won’t say much except that it is a worthy conclusion that still leaves possible room for further adventures in this universe. Spanning over a thousand years, the novel takes us back to the origins of the viral outbreak and the man who will become Patient Zero, the first vampire, then zooms forward centuries to the human settlements that have formed after the apparent disappearance of the viral threat. But, of course, the vampires are not gone . . . simply waiting. When the final battle arrives, humanity faces permanent extinction unless our band of heroes can unite and defeat the first vampire in his lair . . . a crumbling, viral-infested Manhattan. This is sounds interesting to you, definitely start at the first book: The Passage. Fantastic stuff!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26891429-the-city-of-mirrors

Earth Unaware;Orson Scott Card;2012;2010;368;3.98;56268;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Aliens'];"HUMANS THOUGHT THEY WERE ALONE IN THE GALAXY. 
UNTIL NOW.
A hundred years before Ender's Game, humanity is slowly making its way out to the planets of the solar system, exploring and mining asteroids.

The ship El Cavador is far from Earth, in the deeps of the Kuiper Belt, beyond Pluto. When the ship's telescopes pick up a fast-moving object coming in-system, they're unsure what to make of it. 

Little do they know that this object is the most important thing to happen to the human race in a million years. It's humanity's first contact with an alien race. The First Formic War is about to begin.



BOOK ONE OF THE FIRST FORMIC WAR";"Read This Review & More Like It On My Blog!Written as a prequel to the well-loved Ender's Game, Johnston's Earth Unaware tries to fill in some of the holes and unexplored history of the ""Enderverse"" and the first Formic War that led to Battle School, and Ender's adventures in vanquishing the ""hormigas""/Formics. When this book works the most, it succeeds predominately on misplaced nostalgia for the earlier-published-but-later-in-the-chronology novels like Ender's Game, Xenophobe, Children of the Mind, etc. I found Earth Unaware to be a weak, ghost-written book that lacks the easy charisma, dynamic characters, and unique storyline that the other books possessed in abundance and which made them so memorable.There are obviously some good, interesting ideas at play here (the asteroid mining and the cultures that sprout up around them [free miners versus corporations, etc.]) but Aaron Johnston is primarily a graphic novelist, and it shows quite obviously here. Nothing about the novel is realized to its full potential -- from characters to plot to even the action, almost all about Earth Unaware felt contrived, weak, and overdone all at the same time. This is a superficial and shallow adaptation of Ender and the world's backstory, obviously written primarily to lure in fans of Ender's Game and its subsequent sequels. The plot is minimal, the characters are in dire need of more/or a rounded personality (or in Wit's case, a connection to the actual story. His Earth-bound plot will surely coincide with the events of the sequels, but for Earth Unaware, they are more filler than anything else, Mazer Rackham cameo or not.)Wonky pacing, uneven and unconnected storylines, cliched or predictable characters, and more made this a miss for me. The few things I found interesting were often and quickly glossed over to focus on the less developed ideas and characters. There are people who will absolutely love this and gush over the finally explained and explored first contact with the Formics, but Earth Unaware is nowhere near the league of Ender's Game in any area. This review is much shorter than most, but my disappointment with this and OSC's raging homophobia make it almost impossible for an impartial thought.
And other thoughts:
When I first read Ender's Game, I was 10. It was my first scifi novel and Ender was a protagonist seemingly created just for me to love. I still love it to this day, but more for nostalgia and my first sense of how powerful children could be than for anything else. It was revelatory: kids can be heroes and save the world too! Now that I'm older, wiser, and more exposed to the kind of hate that OSC regularly spews towards homosexuals, I find myself less and less inclined to pick up anything he's written (or was written for him.) I debated whether or not to even review this (though it's far from a glowing review) because I don't want to promote OSC in any way, shape or form, negatively or not. In this recent climate, among all these debates about author behavior and how it affects readers, I find it hard to justify my read of this/these books. Sure, OSC has never attacked a negative review or reviewer (to my knowledge, but I certainly try to ignore anything that comes out of his mouth at this point), but how authors behave does impact their work and those who read it. As I was reading Speechless by Hannah Harrington right after this novel, it made me think about silent compliance, ignoring the bad stuff, and just doing what everyone else does for the sake of not making waves. I'm done, I'm gonna make my own wave about this; I just can't support an author who thinks it's right to discriminate against and dehumanize other people. I was granted an ARC of this, but you can bet this author will never see another penny of my cash. I won't be finishing the First Formic War series, and though I thank TOR for the generosity of reading the ARC, even an ARC of the sequel won't tempt me. Goodbye, OSC. I will still reread Ender, but I won't recommend it anyone anymore.So long, Enderverse, and thanks for all the fish.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13151129-earth-unaware

The utter wrongness of it, the way it won’t fit in my head, keeps coming back to me again and again, as if I’ve only just read it. Honestly, there has to be some fundamental law of the universe against sequels that don’t live up to their prequels, and if there isn't, I want it written somewhere that I am conscientiously objecting.The concept and execution in this book are so divorced as to bear no relation to one another. But the biggest problem with the story was the pacing. It takes a long time for the plot to really kick in, trusting on the reader to be invested enough in the possibilities of the story to make it there. Unfortunately, there isn’t really an infinite store of patience to be had, and every page lasts for what is likely only a minute but seems to drag across several years. Eventually, the boredom quickly swallowed my enthusiasm so that what was left simply felt like utter indifference.I must’ve really liked Emika Chen at some point—but I can no longer accurately place her in my head. She gets just enough attention to make it clear she’s important, but that importance never really goes anywhere. We’re expected to believe that she is the fulcrum around which the fate of everyone turns, yet now that I think about it, days later, with the clarity of thought necessary to step back from my disappointment and truly look at what she has done, I realize that her contribution to the narrative racks up to a sum of exactly 0. The people actively attempting to see the pathway out of their problem and into a solution is everyone else but her. Same thing for Hideo: he only haunts the edges of the story but never gets quite enough focus to mean much. I was so artfully uninterested in whatever outcome they bring about until we reach the ending and I realize with enormous indignation that they get to collect all the benefits without having done any of the work. Seriously, what the hell did they actually do? Don’t even get me started on Hideo being portrayed as some sort of Tragic Figure™️ who’s only ever wanted to find his brother, and not addressing the whole, you know, “he created an algorithm that controlled and resulted in the literal deaths of people” thing? I guess rich people get away with actual crime in fiction too.I was also disappointed that at one point, what seemed like the lead-up to a thrilling Warcross game didn’t materialize at all—actually, there is a huge shortage of Warcross in this book. I guess the book was less interested in that aspect than I was, and cast it off relatively quickly in favor of pursuing a less enjoyable narrative cobbled together with few plot twists that—when taken all together—didn't quite reach the high water mark set by the first novel, and building up to an ending and denouement that somehow skirt the edge of taste to be ludicrous and not the least bit satisfying.It’s really a sad thought, but there’s a saving grace: Emika’s team. I was so excited to know them and know the gestalt of who they are, and fortunately for me, we do! Learning about Tremaine and Roshan’s backstory, Hammie’s family, Hammie and Asher’s relationship was about the only thing that buoyed my spirits.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29386918-wildcard
Ancillary Sword;Ann Leckie;2014;2010;359;4.08;55832;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Fantasy'];Seeking atonement for past crimes, Breq takes on a mission as captain of a troublesome new crew of Radchai soldiers.Breq is a soldier who used to be a warship. Once a weapon of conquest controlling thousands of minds, now she has only a single body and serves the emperor.With a new ship and a troublesome crew, Breq is ordered to go to the only place in the galaxy she would agree to go: to Athoek Station to protect the family of a lieutenant she once knew - a lieutenant she murdered in cold blood.;If it's possible, this book is BETTER than the first one. This is just a great Sci-Fi book, wonderful worldbuilding, that focuses on CHARACTERS rather than every planet and ship and technical science thing in the world. Some of that stuff, while interesting, make big sci-fi for me a bit less compelling. This, however, has it ALL! And, contrasting with the first one, it is very clear about POV and stuff. The gender ambiguity is still there, but in a streamlined way, so you don't question things as much in your head. The plotting is excellent, and its just a great sci-fi read. Highly recommended for M/F looking for a good space drama that doesn't have a cast of thousands!;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20706284-ancillary-sword
Reamde;Neal Stephenson;2011;2010;1044;3.99;55816;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Cyberpunk', 'Mystery', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];Four decades ago, Richard Forthrast, the black sheep of an Iowa family, fled to a wild and lonely mountainous corner of British Columbia to avoid the draft. Smuggling backpack loads of high-grade marijuana across the border into Northern Idaho, he quickly amassed an enormous and illegal fortune. With plenty of time and money to burn, he became addicted to an online fantasy game in which opposing factions battle for power and treasure in a vast cyber realm. Like many serious gamers, he began routinely purchasing virtual gold pieces and other desirables from Chinese gold farmers—young professional players in Asia who accumulated virtual weapons and armor to sell to busy American and European buyers.For Richard, the game was the perfect opportunity to launder his aging hundred dollar bills and begin his own high-tech start up—a venture that has morphed into a Fortune 500 computer gaming group, Corporation 9592, with its own super successful online role-playing game, T’Rain. But the line between fantasy and reality becomes dangerously blurred when a young gold farmer accidently triggers a virtual war for dominance—and Richard is caught at the center.In this edgy, 21st century tale, Neal Stephenson, one of the most ambitious and prophetic writers of our time, returns to the terrain of his cyberpunk masterpieces Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon, leading readers through the looking glass and into the dark heart of imagination.;Me: la la la I'm sure this will be edifying and weird.Book: Yes this will be a book about math and philosophy and like, historical dudes  J/K actually I am like 14 Die Hards all squished together!

The Collapsing Empire;John Scalzi;2017;2010;336;4.12;54959;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];The first novel of a new space-opera sequence set in an all-new universe by the Hugo Award-winning, New York Times-bestselling author of Redshirts and Old Man's War.Our universe is ruled by physics and faster than light travel is not possible -- until the discovery of The Flow, an extra-dimensional field we can access at certain points in space-time that transport us to other worlds, around other stars. Humanity flows away from Earth, into space, and in time forgets our home world and creates a new empire, the Interdependency, whose ethos requires that no one human outpost can survive without the others. It’s a hedge against interstellar war -- and a system of control for the rulers of the empire.The Flow is eternal -- but it is not static. Just as a river changes course, The Flow changes as well, cutting off worlds from the rest of humanity. When it’s discovered that The Flow is moving, possibly cutting off all human worlds from faster than light travel forever, three individuals -- a scientist, a starship captain and the Empress of the Interdependency -- are in a race against time to discover what, if anything, can be salvaged from an interstellar empire on the brink of collapse.;As delightful and easy to read as Scalzi at his best (Redshirts, Old Man's War), with characters who are going to stay with you whenever you have to put the book down ... which you aren't going to want to do.I won't discuss plot, at all, but I will say this much: like all great SF, and like the SF that has become accepted as classic, The Collapsing Empire works as a wonderful SF tale ... but it also has important allegory, metaphor, and commentary on some things that are going on right now, for readers who are open to that sort of thing. For those who aren't, it doesn't beat you over the head with it, which is a pretty neat trick.DISCLOSURE: I am very good friends with the author, and I am the narrator of the audiobook.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30078567-the-collapsing-empire

A Million Suns;Beth Revis;2012;2010;386;4.01;54535;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Mystery'];"Godspeed was once fueled by lies. Now it is ruled by chaos.
It’s been three months since Amy was unplugged. The life she always knew is over. Everywhere she looks, she sees the walls of the spaceship Godspeed.But there may be hope: Elder has assumed leadership of the ship. He's finally free to act on his vision—no more Phydus, no more lies.But when Elder learns shocking news about the ship, he and Amy race to discover the truth behind life on Godspeed. They must work together to unlock a mystery that was set in motion hundreds of years earlier. Their success—or failure—will determine the fate of the 2,298 passengers aboard Godspeed. But with each step, the journey becomes more perilous, the ship more chaotic, and the love between them more impossible to fight.Beth Revis catapulted readers into the far reaches of space with her New York Times bestselling debut, Across the Universe. In A Million Suns, Beth deepens the mystery with action, suspense, romance, and deep philosophical questions. And this time it all builds to one mind-bending conclusion: They have to get off this ship.";"Actual rating: 3.5 starsI've been really eager to read A Million Suns for a while now. I'm a Sci-Fi geek and I'm not afraid to admit that.  (Hear that, Kennedy?! I'm owning that!) So I think, in a way, I am prone to getting swept away with this series. And just as with Across the Universe, I was immediately sucked into the story, walking around my house with my face glued to the book, sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure out the mysteries surrounding Godspeed. Because if there is one thing Revis does right, it's anticipation.I struggled with deciding what to rate this book. On one hand I really liked it much better than Across the Universe, but on the other hand the ending let me down a bit. I suppose I should back track a bit and actually talk about the things I loved first. Be warned: the second half of the review will have spoilers.The best part of the book was the plot and pacing. Elder is trying to maintain peace, but the people are making that very difficult. After being enslaved to Phydus for years, some are depressed, rebellious and paranoid. A few citizens prey on those emotions and cause doubt of Elder's ability to lead the people. The result? Chaos and not the beautiful kind. This puts Amy in a very precarious situation because the people blame her for their downward spiral. But Amy and Elder have another issue to handle after Amy discovers Orion has left clues to the Godspeed's biggest secret. I really liked how it felt like the reader's job to help Amy and Elder solve the mystery because this book is very fast paced. The sense of urgency is definitely there throughout the entire novel, never letting the reader catch his/her breath!I also really liked the character growth from Elder. In Across the Universe he was very unsure of himself and for a moment he is that way in the beginning of A Million Suns, but you get to see him grow a back bone along with a matching pair of gonads. This made me really happy because let's be honest, it was about freakin' time! We also get a chance to see Amy work her way through the personal issue on how she feels about Elder. She struggles with this at first because she isn't sure she is in love with him since they are the only two teenagers. She questions whether it is really love when you don't have any other choices. I would have liked to see more development from Amy besides whether she wanted to be with Elder or not.And that leads us into the bad.*spoilers ahead*What really ticked me off with this book was the ending. Everything was going perfectly well until the villain and the ship's secret were revealed. Orion has left Amy a series of video recordings of this huge secret he is sitting on and he tells her only she can make this choice and how it is such a huge decision...yada, yada, yada. That's great. Really. I can totally get down with that. What I can't get down with is the actual secret. We find out that Godspeed has actually been at the new planet since the ""plague"" popped up generations ago. But they haven't landed because planet scans reveal that whatever lives on the planet isn't friendly and they will probably have to go to war once they land. So the Elder system and Phydus were created to keep the people in check and prevent anyone from finding out the truth. So for all those years, Godspeed has just been orbiting around the new planet. All the while the food supply is quickly dwindling and the ship is falling apart. But what I don't understand is why they didn't communicate with Earth and GO HOME? Whose brilliant idea was it to stay on the ship that is falling apart FOREVER?  *smacks forehead* Then we had a few plot inconsistencies.  At one point in the novel people are rioting over the lack of food. They even go so far as to burn down the Food Distro building, but suddenly at the end we are fed this BS: ""The scientists agree that the internal functions of the ship could last for at least a generation, maybe indefinitely if the biosphere is maintained and energy conserved."" Then a few pages later Elder tells Amy they have enough food for a few more generations. WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN? You can't tell us one thing and then completely say, ""Oops, my bad, guys. My bad."" at the end of the book. You do not get to change your book canon just to take an easy way out when it comes to ending your story. Oh, and remember that little flop at the end of Across the Universe? You know the one where Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion are completely ignored? Yeah, that one. That little issue is cleared up in the very first chapter, but I noticed something that was a little off. Elder is told that the shippers lied to Eldest about the engine, that he didn't know the engine had stopped working. He thought they were still moving. But later when Amy is busy discovering Orion's clues we are told Eldest knew they were right next to the new planet and like the Eldest before him, he was keeping this from the people because he didn't think it was a good idea to land.  Now, wait one damn minute. If Eldest knew they were right next to the planet and didn't want to land, then how is it he didn't know about the engine not moving the ship? And finally Amy, who suddenly became TSTL in the final chapters. So we all know Amy was almost raped in Across the Universe and that guy continues to stalk her until she and another character extracted vengeance on him. This made me very happy because Amy actually did something for once besides running around the ship. But then when the guy is found dead she hesitates before launching his body into space. I wouldn't have been able to push that button fast enough. But, okay. Fine, Amy. Then when the villain reveals himself and has a gun pointed at Amy saying he'd kill her, she later tells Elder she couldn't kill him even though there was a chance he could have killed them. Okay, maybe I can understand that. But here is where  the sense falls apart. The villain had started to reanimate Orion and you know what Amy says she wants? To let Orion drown in his cryo liquid! Now I admit, Orion wasn't the best guy in Across the Universe, but his crimes do not stack up against the rapist or the villain in A Million Suns and yet Amy has the most anger and hostility towards him. The guy who revealed to her that they had arrived at the planet. This does not compute! She even goes as far to have a tantrum about it like a 4-year-old. I'm sorry, but that makes no sense. /end rantYet, despite all of my complaints, I did really enjoy this book. It had an unputdownable quality to it that can't be ignored. Fans of Across the Universe will more than likely enjoy A Million Suns. I'd even go as far to say even more so than Across the Universe. I just really wish the ending concluded on the same level of awesomeness that it began. I'll definitely check out the last book because I NEED to know how it ends!More reviews and other cool things at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10345927-a-million-suns

Thrawn;Timothy Zahn;2017;2010;427;4.31;51434;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Novels'];"One of the most cunning and ruthless warriors in the history of the Galactic Empire, Grand Admiral Thrawn is also one of the most captivating characters in the Star Wars universe, from his introduction in bestselling author Timothy Zahn’s classic Heir to the Empire through his continuing adventures in Dark Force Rising, The Last Command, and beyond. But Thrawn’s origins and the story of his rise in the Imperial ranks have remained mysterious. Now, in Star Wars: Thrawn, Timothy Zahn chronicles the fateful events that launched the blue-skinned, red-eyed master of military strategy and lethal warfare into the highest realms of power—and infamy.After Thrawn is rescued from exile by Imperial soldiers, his deadly ingenuity and keen tactical abilities swiftly capture the attention of Emperor Palpatine. And just as quickly, Thrawn proves to be as indispensable to the Empire as he is ambitious; as devoted as its most loyal servant, Darth Vader; and a brilliant warrior never to be underestimated. On missions to rout smugglers, snare spies, and defeat pirates, he triumphs time and again—even as his renegade methods infuriate superiors while inspiring ever greater admiration from the Empire. As one promotion follows another in his rapid ascension to greater power, he schools his trusted aide, Ensign Eli Vanto, in the arts of combat and leadership, and the secrets of claiming victory. But even though Thrawn dominates the battlefield, he has much to learn in the arena of politics, where ruthless administrator Arihnda Pryce holds the power to be a potent ally or a brutal enemy.All these lessons will be put to the ultimate test when Thrawn rises to admiral and must pit all the knowledge, instincts, and battle forces at his command against an insurgent uprising that threatens not only innocent lives but also the Empire’s grip on the galaxy—and his own carefully laid plans for future ascendancy.";This is a great book. I had very high hopes for this book. All the ingredients seemed to be in place. I remember reading Heir to the Empire trilogy when it first came. This ignited my love of reading , and I have devoured everything from the expanded universe. What could go wrong with the book they even had Timothy Zahn (Thrawn's original creater). What could go wrong? NOTHING!!! The book is AWSOME!!!!As much as I loved Heir to the Empire, we were never given too much background of Thrawn's raise through the Imperial ranks. The fact that he was as non-human at the rank of Grand Admiral, which was unheard of in the xenophobic Imperial military. So he must have been brilliant to stand out or get as far as he did. However, we never got that part of his story apart from hints. This book fills in many of those banks whilst leaving part to expand on for later. It covers the highlights of Thrawn's entire Imperial career up till the point of him reaching Grand Admiral. On a side note as evil as Palpatine was, I have not read anywhere about him being xenophobic himself, I am wondering if this is another Tarkin-ism that was passed through the military.This has more than wet my appetite for Rebels Season 3. unless you have already seen this season, I would say read this before watching this it should enhance the viewing and provide a couple of links towards the end of the book. I think Eli says it be as much as not is not possible to fully know Thrawn. He is as complex as he is brilliant. The thing this book portrays is that Thrawn is not evil. He can be cold and a military man through and through, but he is always aiming his tactics for preserving life and collateral damage. I also like the introduction of the Nightsswan as Thrawns adversery and Eli as a sort of apprentice. Towards the end of the book, we do get a bit more understanding of why Thrawn joined the Empire. Even though he is not in the book much, I do like that fact that they show Palpatine is not an idiot. He is a very skilled tactician as well, especially in their last conversation.I can not recommend this book enough even with my sky-high expectations this book delivered in every way. This is a great book for old Star Wars fans like men and fans getting to know Thrawn for the first time or even wanting background on him after seeing him in the TV series.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31140332-thrawn

Record of a Spaceborn Few;Becky  Chambers;2018;2010;359;4.12;50878;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Space'];Centuries after the last humans left Earth, the Exodus Fleet is a living relic, a place many are from but few outsiders have seen. Humanity has finally been accepted into the galactic community, but while this has opened doors for many, those who have not yet left for alien cities fear that their carefully cultivated way of life is under threat.Tessa chose to stay home when her brother Ashby left for the stars, but has to question that decision when her position in the Fleet is threatened.Kip, a reluctant young apprentice, itches for change but doesn't know where to find it.Sawyer, a lost and lonely newcomer, is just looking for a place to belong.When a disaster rocks this already fragile community, those Exodans who still call the Fleet their home can no longer avoid the inescapable question:What is the purpose of a ship that has reached its destination?;Here's the part where you think I'm going to eat my words. But I don't think I have to: think of it as being able to love Star Wars, and The Empire Strikes Back, but not Return of the Jedi. In fact, it's nearly exactly like that.In this book, Chambers seems to think people are basically this: hippie communeOr, in my analogy,   Ewok villageBut they aren't. People are basically beings with a variety of upbringings, chemical soups, and experiences. Which often suck. Except in this book, where they don't suck. Sure, humans might be tired, or selfish, or cranky, or scared. But they'll feel guilty, or talk it out at the end of the day, or Do The Right Thing (TM), and basically respect each other's right to be people. Chambers has forgotten that out in the world, there is this: creepy molester and criminal bossor this:beings willing to capture your ass for money and sell you to the highest bidderBut hey! I’m usually an At-Least-You-Have-a-Glass-of-Water kind of person, so I could have gotten on board with a book that tended to forget about the more dysfunctional among us, if only the narrative hadn’t been so disjointed. We followed a bunch of different people doing a bunch of different things. I get the agenda: show the microcosm of experience through the individual and let it gestalt into a whole picture of how a civilization coped with diaspora. Except it doesn’t, not at all.The story begins with a woman, Tessa, and her small child, Aya, and ends on Aya’s scream. It then switches point of view to Isabel the Archivist as she films the scene at a horrible space accident. It switches again to that of Eyas, a professional undertaker, a ceremonial and practical position, as she and her colleagues try to comprehend how they will process forty-three thousand bodies on the fragile eco-system of the space station. We jump to young Kip and his dad as they witness the arrival of the alien Aeluons who will help, then jump again to the human Sawyer, on his home installation, witnessing a group of Exodans mourning the disaster. The space accident frames our introduction to these people, but in an odd way, has very little influence on the story. I rather missed the fallout (ha!) when I realized Chambers had moved on to another story.I really wish I could have gotten behind the stories of these people. Not Kip, because his is the story of the adolescent-on-the-verge-of-adulthood, and I don’t care very much about that story, and Chambers brings exactly nothing new to it to keep me interested. And honestly, not so much Tessa, because Tessa’s the core of most women’s lit-fic where a woman is just raising her family the best she can while her partner is far, far away. My interest in Sawyer’s story was limited by his devastating naivete, kind of like Luke when he first goes to the space station, only Sawyer doesn’t have anyone watching out for him, so it’s pretty obvious he’s going to Fall In With Bad People. But Eyas’ involvement in ritualized death and organic reclamation is vaguely interesting, as is Isabel’s general work, along with her guest, the alien ethnologist. Which, now that I count, amounts to two stories that were really interesting and a couple that were vaguely interesting, and one that was annoying. The book might have still worked for me if it was told a bit more like A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet, or as short stories that gave insight into each character, but the chapters frequently ended on a sort of emotional or plot cliffhanger. It was a poor choice, because it disrupted the character build and ruined the plot build. Frequently, the ‘resolution’ would be finding out the aftermath of how something was managed, not the actual scene where it played out. Contributing further to the sense of disjointedness, Chambers also resorts to a device from the first book, and gives a sort of alien journalist-historical entry perspective at the beginning of each of the seven sections.Ultimately, I could have gotten behind a rose-colored-glasses look at a human exodus from Earth, had it been better told, or with more interesting characters. For the most part, these stories were too small to tell such a big story, trying too hard to wrap the breadcrumbs of everyday life into world events. I lost interest about halfway through and resorted to skimming. I thought I’d keep it around and try giving it a more serious go, but someone else in the library system wants it, and frankly, they’re welcome to it.I might try it again, but only in the way that I try custard every few years, to see if it is still as uninteresting as the last time I tried it. And the same way I watch Return of the Jedi, which is to say, hardly at all, and only if I’m feeling particularly completionist (I just quit after Han is freed, naturally.);https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32802595-record-of-a-spaceborn-few
We Are the Ants;Shaun David Hutchinson;2016;2010;455;4.11;50649;yes;['Young Adult', 'LGBT', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Queer', 'Romance'];From the author of The Five Stages of Andrew Brawley comes a brand-new novel about a teenage boy who must decide whether or not the world is worth saving.Henry Denton has spent years being periodically abducted by aliens. Then the aliens give him an ultimatum: The world will end in 144 days, and all Henry has to do to stop it is push a big red button.Only he isn’t sure he wants to.After all, life hasn’t been great for Henry. His mom is a struggling waitress held together by a thin layer of cigarette smoke. His brother is a jobless dropout who just knocked someone up. His grandmother is slowly losing herself to Alzheimer’s. And Henry is still dealing with the grief of his boyfriend’s suicide last year.Wiping the slate clean sounds like a pretty good choice to him.But Henry is a scientist first, and facing the question thoroughly and logically, he begins to look for pros and cons: in the bully who is his perpetual one-night stand, in the best friend who betrayed him, in the brilliant and mysterious boy who walked into the wrong class. Weighing the pain and the joy that surrounds him, Henry is left with the ultimate choice: push the button and save the planet and everyone on it…or let the world—and his pain—be destroyed forever.;"Your entire sense of self-worth is predicated upon your belief that you matter, that you matter to the universe.But you don't.Because we are the ants.
My first 5 stars of 2016!This book. Seriously. I hadn't read any of the author's other work. I wasn't even sure that the premise promised a book I would like. My curiosity was piqued when I saw the good critical reviews it was getting, but that has meant little in the past so I wasn't completely convinced...But it was so damn good. The truth is, while I always wait for the end before deciding on a book rating, most of the time there's a little part of me that just knows near the beginning when I've picked up a 5-star book. It's a book that does something a bit different, and it has a pull you know will drag you through those pages.Henry Denton's narrative is so compelling, nihilistic and hilarious. He's a smart, witty and very funny human being, prone to one tragic misfortune after another. The way he portrays and explores the world around him is excellent, showing us intricate family bonds, friendships, love and all the wonder and horror of the world we live in.The book opens with Henry telling us about the aliens. The aliens who have abducted him several times, conducted experiments on him, and finally given him the ultimate choice. The world is going to end, but pushing a button will stop it - will Henry find reason to save the world?In the wrong hands, it could have been unbearably cheesy, but the tone is just right. Dark, but often comical. Sad, but full of heart-warming moments too. The description gives the impression that Henry meets Diego and his perspective on life changes, but it's far more complex than that. This book is not a romance, and so many characters have an important part to play in the telling of the story: Henry's ex-boyfriend who committed suicide, his alcoholic wannabe-chef mother, the popular boy who makes out with him one minute and bullies him the next, his grandmother with Alzheimer's, his college-dropout brother, as well as others.All the characters are so well-developed, all are complex, none are throwaway. Hutchinson weaves relationships gradually, throughout the novel, showing all the layers that exist underneath the surface and - ultimately - showing that every person has more than one side, is more than one thing.It's the kind of truly smart and insightful book that doesn't come along too often. And it left my mind spinning with thoughts long after I finished the last page.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23677341-we-are-the-ants
Dry;Neal Shusterman;2018;2010;390;4.02;48272;no;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Survival', 'Contemporary'];"When the California drought escalates to catastrophic proportions, one teen is forced to make life and death decisions for her family in this harrowing story of survival,The drought—or the Tap-Out, as everyone calls it—has been going on for a while now. Everyone’s lives have become an endless list of don’ts: don’t water the lawn, don’t fill up your pool, don’t take long showers.Until the taps run dry.Suddenly, Alyssa’s quiet suburban street spirals into a warzone of desperation; neighbors and families turned against each other on the hunt for water. And when her parents don’t return and her life—and the life of her brother—is threatened, Alyssa has to make impossible choices if she’s going to survive.";"Only now do I see how dry his lips are. Not just dry but parched and chapped to the point of bleeding. None of these kids look right. Their skin is thin and almost leprous gray. The corners of their mouths are white with dried spit. And the look in their eyes is almost rabid.
It's unsettling how utterly convincing this book is. Maybe it works so well because the concept is so relevant and believable - a severe drought in Southern California is hardly fantastical - but it also has a lot to do with the way the Shusterman duo writes. In a style somewhat reminiscent of storytellers like Stephen King, the authors paint this dystopian picture slowly, gradually, introducing a fairly large cast of characters along the way. The horrors creep quietly into a world that very closely resembles our own, making them easy to believe in. What is first a subdued desire for water becomes a pressing need, which in turn becomes an obsessive frenzy.You can tell a lot of thought has gone into how people would behave when their lives (or worse-- the lives of their families) become threatened by a lack of water. When the people in Dry become desperate, it’s amazing and terrible what can be seen as a source of water. And let me tell you: the authors and the characters in this book get VERY creative on that front.
Could we be so desperate for drinkable water that we're willing to destroy the very machines that could create it, just to get that first sip?
The way the characters are used to tell the story here might not suit everyone. The Shustermans bring in many different perspectives in order to capture all angles of the water craze rather than focusing on one or a few individuals. I can pinpoint the main characters as Alyssa, Kelton, Garrett and Jacqui (who is freaking awesome, by the way) but I would still say this is more a book about the bigger picture, which includes many people's perspectives across the course of the novel. The characters are left racially ambiguous, some described as ""olive-skinned"" but of indeterminate race.It's a standalone and so a whole lot is covered in these 350 pages. We see how a survivalist family first thrives but then becomes a target; we see how kind neighbours become enemies; we see an entrepreneurial few try to capitalize on the new hot commodity; we see the ugliness that can quickly rear its head when people are desperate.I thought it worked really well at creating a sense of desperation and paranoia. It made ME want to go stock up on emergency supplies (I swear I'm not even joking. I found myself on this page after reading it.) Very convincing and discomfiting.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38355098-dry
Just One Damned Thing After Another;Jodi Taylor;2013;2010;480;3.88;47402;yes;['Time Travel', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Historical'];"""History is just one damned thing after another.""Behind the seemingly innocuous façade of St Mary's, a different kind of historical research is taking place. They don't do 'time-travel' - they 'investigate major historical events in contemporary time'. Maintaining the appearance of harmless eccentrics is not always within their power - especially given their propensity for causing loud explosions when things get too quiet.Meet the disaster-magnets of St Mary's Institute of Historical Research as they ricochet around History. Their aim is to observe and document - to try and find the answers to many of History's unanswered questions...and not to die in the process. But one wrong move and History will fight back - to the death. And, as they soon discover - it's not just History they're fighting.Follow the catastrophe curve from 11th-century London to World War I, and from the Cretaceous Period to the destruction of the Great Library at Alexandria. For wherever Historians go, chaos is sure to follow in their wake....";"The title unfortunately describes the way this book is plotted. Things happen, and they are sort of loosely slung-together, with very little sense of time passing (at one point the protagonist notes she's known another character for five years, and I genuinely thought only a single year had passed since their meeting at the beginning of the novel) and with absolutely no character development. No characters at all, really: Taylor's creations seem to turn on a dime, depending on whatever the plot (""plot""?) dictates. Out of nowhere, one character is suddenly revealed to be a sexual predator, because Taylor needs the reader to hate him now. The love interest up and screams at the protagonist, also out of nowhere, for...angst I guess? Oh and some rando background character suddenly calls the protagonist a slut and...sexually attacks her. Of course. I see more of a pattern here than to the plot and it's gross.The main character has no personality except to be perfect at everything and drive evil people to fits of revealing rage -- classic Mary Sue stuff. I get annoyed with the overuse and misuse of that term, but it really applies here. Max feels like a self-insert. She, her love interest, and the innumerable interchangeable secondary characters are all amazingly under-characterized and flatly written: I couldn't describe a single one of them to you, nor could I tell them apart much of the time. (Which one was Markham and which was Murdoch again?) Early in the book, Max notes that she often does not react to things in a ""normal"" way, but this is never used to make a point about her history or to develop her character as the story progresses; instead, it feels like Taylor simply did not know how to write realistic reactions to situations and was using this as an excuse.And nothing else makes sense either! You have a secret -- but not all that secret if it's known by a major university and receives ""assignments"" -- time travel organization, which for some reason is severely understaffed. At one point they only have four historians (a.k.a. time travelers) working for them, and don't hire more -- but no real qualification seems necessary? Like Max makes a big deal about how rigorous the training is, but without actually conveying that in any way, and it's also not explained why they can't just recruit more people for the training in the first place. Max's ""specialty"" as a historian is brought up, but then she never works on anything related to it. They send her back to study dinosaurs when her speciality was ancient Greek and Roman civ. You guys couldn't recruit some paleontologists? As a time travel book, this novel makes poor use of its subject. In fact, nearly no use: the main conceit of historians using time travel in their studies was done better many times over by Connie Willis; the big ""twist"" is the starting point for many other time travel narratives, and seemed so obvious that the characters not figuring it out sooner just makes them look dumb. On the most basic level, St. Mary's does not seem like a fun or exciting organization to work for, so why would I want to read about it? This book was baffling for me from start to finish; I kept waiting for it to get going, then to get better. It didn't. Now I wish I could go back in time and not bother.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29661618-just-one-damned-thing-after-another
Waking Gods;Sylvain Neuvel;2017;2010;336;4.0;47090;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Aliens', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];As a child, Rose Franklin made an astonishing discovery: a giant metallic hand, buried deep within the earth. As an adult, she’s dedicated her brilliant scientific career to solving the mystery that began that fateful day: Why was a titanic robot of unknown origin buried in pieces around the world? Years of investigation have produced intriguing answers—and even more perplexing questions. But the truth is closer than ever before when a second robot, more massive than the first, materializes and lashes out with deadly force. Now humankind faces a nightmare invasion scenario made real, as more colossal machines touch down across the globe. But Rose and her team at the Earth Defense Corps refuse to surrender. They can turn the tide if they can unlock the last secrets of an advanced alien technology. The greatest weapon humanity wields is knowledge in a do-or-die battle to inherit the Earth . . . and maybe even the stars.;"Wow, where should I start?I absolutely LOVED this book. After I read Sleeping Giants on a whim last year, I ended up being sucked into its incredible premise: giant body parts are discovered in the earth that predate the human technology required to make them. A simple idea with huge implications. What does this mean for humanity? For science? Religion? Maybe it's just me, but I get shivers at the question: if there is something on our planet that didn't occur naturally, that we didn't make, that we couldn't have made - then, who did?To be honest, I wasn't sure Waking Gods would have as much of an effect on me. Sleeping Giants had already started to answer some questions, and with the atmosphere of mystery dwindling, I wasn't sure exactly what a sequel would offer. Well, seriously, I don't even know how to convey how exciting, fast-paced and unputdownable this book was.Waking Gods is a heart-pounding thrill ride. I loved everything about it. From the action scenes as things get bigger and bigger and it seems humanity might really be doomed, to the scientific details which were so damn interesting! I love sci-fi books that seem (not like I'd know for sure) grounded in scientific fact. It adds an extra dose of realism; of possibility. The style of narration also really appeals to me. The story unfolds through interview transcripts and journal entries, which works wonders for the pacing. It keeps us constantly in the moment, gives us further insight into the characters, and never gets bogged down by too much description. Plus, most of the interviews are conducted by an unnamed interviewer (yes, we do learn more about him), giving it an additional air of mystery. And he's snarky as fuck, which also helps.Look, you probably already know by now if this book is for you or not. If you like sci-fi that opens up worlds of possibility, that makes you feel smaller than you knew was possible, that offers new, thrilling and scary answers to some of the oldest questions -- READ THIS SERIES.

The Prisoner of Cell 25;Richard Paul Evans;2011;2010;336;4.22;46559;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Middle Grade', 'Teen'];My name is Michael Vey, and the story I’m about to tell you is strange. Very strange. It’s my story.To everyone at Meridian High School, Michael Vey is an ordinary fourteen-year-old. In fact, the only thing that seems to set him apart is the fact that he has Tourette’s syndrome. But Michael is anything but ordinary. Michael has special powers. Electric powers.Michael thinks he's unique until he discovers that a cheerleader named Taylor also has special powers. With the help of Michael’s friend, Ostin, the three of them set out to discover how Michael and Taylor ended up this way, but their investigation brings them to the attention of a powerful group who wants to control the electric children – and through them the world. Michael will have to rely on his wits, powers, and friends if he’s to survive.;"Oh, why why why why why why why why WHY did I read this horrible, cliche-ridden book? So I can give a bad review of it, that's why!  So, in brief, this book is about Michael Vey, a teenager that has electrical powers. Here's the cliche part: Michael Vey is a scrawny teen that's constantly bullied, his best friend's a nerdy loser, and the main girl in the story is the most popular and prettiest girl in school. Oh, she's also a cheerleader.  Michael soon finds out that Taylor, aka 'most popular and prettiest cheerleader in school', also has electrical powers like he does. What a co-wink-e-dink! <--how the hell do you spell that? Right after they find out that they both have powers, Taylor says; ""We should start a club!"" I highly doubt a fifteen year old girl (cheerleader!) would say something like that. I swear, these kids act like they're in elementary school instead of high school.  Shortly after they (meaning Michael, Taylor, and his best friend Ostin) form the club, they find out that Taylor and Michael's power isn't as coincidental as they thought. Someone is looking for them, and that someone kidnaps Michael's mother and Taylor on his birthday. He sets out to find them.  The biggest issue I have on this 'book' is the horrid writing. We are talking about an adult, correct? A twelve year old could write this book better.Example: Taylor looked around. She caught Zeus staring at her. He looked away. She thought he was cute. It was full of 'I said, she said, he said, I asked, I said, he said etc...' Put some depth behind your characters, for cheese sakes! The characters had no depth whatsoever, I felt the author didn't even try with this book.  And what's with the name? 'The Prisoner of Cell 25'? Cell 25 only comes in once in the book, and not for very long, so I don't get why they'd name the book after such a small part in the book. Five pages into the book, I was already insulted. Unlike you, I live in Idaho. Don't ask me what state Idaho is in -news flash- Idaho IS a state.The writing talks down to its reader, like the reader was stupid. This line is insulting because a lot of people live in Idaho, or have lived in Idaho (I grew up in Idaho!), plus, everyone above second grade knows Idaho is indeed a state. I realize the author was doing this to be funny, but to me, it just immediately made the main character sound like a little shit. The very next line in the book is also insulting;For one, I have Tourette's syndrome. You probably know less about Tourette's syndrome than you do Idaho.  Both my brother and my sister have been diagnosed with Autism and Asberger's for as long as I've known, so yes, I know many forms of mental illnesses. And again, this sentence talked down to its reader, even worse than the Idaho one. It's also ridden with pathetic attempts at humor (Ostin imagining himself being rich and famous one day surrounded by hot 'chicks' who worship him wasn't funny, it was angering). In one particularly irritating sentence, Michael asked his mother what he should get Taylor for her birthday and asked her what girls liked. She replied; ""Trust me, we're all the same. We like clothes and jewelry. And flowers."" ""We're all the same""?!?!?!I never had a more powerful urge to throw the book across the room at that point. Here's a list of a few things I like: BooksAnimalsReadingMusicManga/Anime Video GamesGeeky TV shows from the 60's and 70'sDo you see clothes on this list? Or jewelry? Or flowers? I don't think so! If he got that from his wife then she hasn't been out much; if he came up with that himself, he's a sexist bastard. Not every woman likes clothes and flowers and jewelry. That's just stereotypical bullshit.The only thing I liked about this book is that their powers weren't 'magical' but scientific. They were slightly realistic and I could imagine them happening. In a Marvel comic So as you can see, I really hated this book. It got kind of interesting towards the end, but I still despised it, and will NEVER EVER READ AGAIN. I urge you, do not read this book if you care about your intelligence!Thanks for reading.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11337912-the-prisoner-of-cell-25

Ariadne is one such explorer. As an astronaut on an extrasolar research vessel, she and her fellow crewmates sleep between worlds and wake up each time with different features. Her experience is one of fluid body and stable mind and of a unique perspective on the passage of time. Back on Earth, society changes dramatically from decade to decade, as it always does.Ariadne may awaken to find that support for space exploration back home has waned, or that her country of birth no longer exists, or that a cult has arisen around their cosmic findings, only to dissolve once more by the next waking. But the moods of Earth have little bearing on their mission: to explore, to study, and to send their learnings home. Carrying all the trademarks of her other beloved works, including brilliant writing, fantastic world-building and exceptional, diverse characters, Becky's first audiobook outside of the Wayfarers series is sure to capture the imagination of listeners all over the world.;One of my newest favorite books.Becky Chambers has a way with words that makes every book she writes feel like home.

 which would be a lot more fun if not for the adopted sibling incest, worst case of bury your gays i have ever had the displeasure of seeing, and also eugenics. At around the halfway I was actually planning to give this a two-star rating, just based off how addictive it was and how much I personally enjoyed it. But given how much the ending pissed me off, and given that after over six months (update: almost four years) I despise this book more every time I think about it, I'm not at all planning on changing this rating. This book deserves its rating. You're all waiting for the roast, right? It's at the bottom. Okay, first of all, this isn't a cool dystopia; this book is about 
romantic drama.
 Yes, there's a little worldbuilding, and it's interesting when we do see it. But the focus is on dating. Eris used to like Cord who likes Rylin, Avery and Leda like Atlas, but Watt also likes Avery. The only relationship I could bring myself to care about was 
Eris' relationship with Mariel,
 which was genuine and led Eris through some GREAT development and then gets ruined because of course it does. Every other relationship felt like a plot point for drama. Cord and Rylin weren't a horrible couple either, but unfortunately, they were clearly there for the drama. Atlas and Avery creeped me out. Look, I have a stepbrother. Siblings, even if they aren't biological, should not date. Yuck.
✔ GOSSIP GIRL HAD MORE CHARACTER DEPTH THAN THIS
⭐ Avery, aka Cersei Lannister, is a virginal blonde girl who lives on the top floor, and she's utterly insufferable. Avery slutshames, talks shit about all her friends, and is ridiculously hateable. That's her entire character. I feel like she has a lot of potential as a delicious antihero, but she's not portrayed as an antihero - she's portrayed as an innocent. Also, she fucks her brother. Yeah.⭐ Watt is a stalker. That's his only character trait. Besides a few weirdly racial stereotypes. ⭐ Leda... was a very frustrating character to follow. She begins the story as a former drug addict who's really trying to get clean and has some nice relationships with her mom and brother. She's loyal and into meditation, and really the only annoying bit about her is her dislike for Eris. She ends the book as a completely terrible person with no character whatsoever. Leda's character arc feels 
messy at best and false at worst.
 You deserved better, Leda. She, too, has a lot of potential as a delicious antihero, but she's not portrayed as an antihero - she's the villain. ⭐ Rylin is very protective of her sister, Chrissa, and is less rich than the rest - she lives on 32. Her character is a bit of a cliche, poor because her mother is dead, but she's less whiny than the rich kids. She had potential. HOWEVER. Rylin's character development is not positive, and she's reduced almost entirely to 
her bland romance plot.
⭐ Eris annoyed me a lot at the beginning, but she grew on me. She is forced to live down on the bottom levels by a family tragedy, and her relationship with her parents was relatively well-developed. Erin is also the only character that really develops, which is like... sad.To some degree this book is enjoyable in that ""mindless drama"" sort of way. It's just too bad it was so, so problematic and angering. 
✔ THIS BOOK IS YIKES AND IN CONCLUSION: I AM BITTER
♚ While I loved Eris as a character, it should be noted that she's stereotyped too - it's time for us to end the trope of 
the one bisexual character who ""sleeps around"" and almost cheats.
♔ 
Soooooooo much girl hate and slutshaming.
 Oh god, there was so much girl hate in this book in general. Aside from Eris and Mariel, who are dating, there is not one positive relationship between women, and worse, most of the issues in these friendships revolve around guys or slutshaming. This is just annoying. It's 2017. We can have normal friendships. ♚ Women are treated like sex objects and no one really does anything about it. You guys think I'm kidding. At one point, a male characters slaps a female character's ass - they are not dating - and it is literally just considered a flirty gesture by the girl. This is really just objectively shitty worldbuilding; we're living in 2150, and you're telling me treating girls like meat is still okay?♔ Pretty much all the dude love interests are somewhat hypermasculine and vaguely creepy in my reading. I think I'm supposed to want Atlas and Avery together, but honestly, their relationship read as somewhat... creepy... to me. And not even just because they're siblings [oh yeah, they're siblings] but Atlas is just a fucking creeper. He reads like every 30-year-old who's ever hit on me at the gym.♚ Rape was treated somewhat badly, at least in my reading. There's also something that happens at the end of this book where it's implied one character daterapes another character and it's fairly glossed over. It's possible that this was meant to be horrifying and will be handled better in book two; that being said, to me it came across as ""it's not real rape because it's a dude."" ♔ Some kind of... racial stereotyping. Yikes. One character is described as Middle Eastern, and has three character traits: socially awkward, computer nerd, and either can't get laid or is desperately trying to get laid. That's... a lot of major stereotypes about East Asian men, and he's not East Asian, but it still feels like a negative portrayal. The one dark-skinned character is addicted to drugs and also... you know, the villain of the fucking book. And the one other mixed-race character is a poor person who turns to thievery. Of the rich characters, two out of three are white, while both poor characters are not white. You can actually list the characters by wealth and the two wealthiest characters are white. If this connection were analyzed, it could be an interesting thematic element and parallel racism in real life. But it's not. And I recognize this could all be coincidence, but the fact that a lot of the characters here are racial stereotypes is pretty... uncomfortable. ♚ The most genuinely upsetting part of this is that Avery, a ""genetically perfect"" model created by her parents, is blonde and white. Let's just emphasize this. 
She's genetically perfect because she's white. Genetic perfection = whiteness.
 Yes, I recognize that this is the standard of beauty we know right now in America and Europe. Yes, I recognize that a lot of white authors haven't necessarily interrogated that. Yes, I recognize that this is probably an accident. But this is straight-up racist eugenics. In this supposedly racially diverse future world, making genetic manipulation with the specific intent of beauty lead to a white lead is genuinely horrifying. And on a related note, Avery is a far more terrible human being than most of the characters, yet she's given a lot of narrative sympathy other characters do not. (Arguably, any genetic manipulation is in and of itself eugenics, and I think any narrative wanting to talk about genetics should actually unpack that. But also, in 2016, I think unpacking felt like too much to ask from ya lit or lit in general to be fucking honest. So I'll just leave it at the bare-minimum standard of 'your genetic perfection being a white person has uncomfortable implications' and go. ♚ This is a 
major, major spoiler
 for the end and for book two, but it's also something I think sapphics especially will want to know before picking up: bury your gays. Severe. Because as we all know, burying BOTH of your queer lead characters for the development of your all-straight, all-alive cast is so creative. So never-before-done. So seldom-discussed. Anyway, point is, if you write a book with, oh, maybe seven straight main characters, and then two sapphics, and you choose to bury the bi girl in your first book and the lesbian in your second book and all the straight people are still alive? 
Your book has a fucking problem.
 VERDICT: I genuinely think this book is terrible. I really would like to imagine this was all intentional, and the author will subvert it all in book three, but I really don't think that's at all what's happening here. I'm tired and I'm angry and I am really done caring if people know it. I don't think this is a book or author that I want to support, ever.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24921954-the-thousandth-floor

Starters;Lissa Price;2012;2010;352;3.88;44545;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Post Apocalyptic'];HER WORLD IS CHANGED FOREVERCallie lost her parents when the Spore Wars wiped out everyone between the ages of twenty and sixty. She and her little brother, Tyler, go on the run, living as squatters with their friend Michael and fighting off renegades who would kill them for a cookie. Callie's only hope is Prime Destinations, a disturbing place in Beverly Hills run by a mysterious figure known as the Old Man.He hires teens to rent their bodies to Enders—seniors who want to be young again. Callie, desperate for the money that will keep her, Tyler, and Michael alive, agrees to be a donor. But the neurochip they place in Callie's head malfunctions and she wakes up in the life of her renter, living in her mansion, driving her cars, and going out with a senator's grandson. It feels almost like a fairy tale, until Callie discovers that her renter intends to do more than party—and that Prime Destinations' plans are more evil than Callie could ever have imagined. . . .;"These days it is hard to write a dystopian YA and have it stand out. Starters did not have that problem; it was impressive from start to finish.In the first few pages, we are immersed in the dangerous world where Callie, the protagonist of the book, lives. There has been a horrible war where the US has fell victim to a terrible biological attack, where only the elderly and young have been vaccinated. Unsurprisingly, this leaves the young to fend for themselves. Callie is forced to make some tough decisions when an offer to rent her young body to an elderly person for a short time comes across the table. This money could save her little brother's life.There are countless strengths of this novel. The key, however, is Callie. She is a terrific main character; she is strong, resourceful, intelligent and brave... but at the same time believable and utterly likeable. She will do anything to take care of her little brother. Also, this novel begins in the middle-- right in the center of the action and never lets up all the way through. I blazed through this book and couldn't put it down. The starkness and clarity of the prose really came through; it was crisply written. I loved each of the twists and did not even predict the biggest one. It's hard to do that with a seasoned YA veteran reader. Furthermore, the other characters were well developed. Probably my other favorite character was Madison- I'll leave the reader to discover her. She was an utter gem. The world that Lissa Price builds is terrible but very believable; while not entirely unique (which is pretty impossible at this point), she gave a brand-new spin in her creation of this dystopian society.And the Old Man. There are several mysteries that I have still lingering in my mind and that will haunt me until December.Overall, a smashing debut in a genre that is very difficult to break into. This book is in the top 5 books that I have read in the past year, and one that I believe earns its place along with Pandemonium and Divergent. Lissa Price will be one to watch.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11861062-starters
Ship Breaker;Paolo Bacigalupi;2010;2010;326;3.75;44334;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Fantasy'];In America's Gulf Coast region, where grounded oil tankers are being broken down for parts, Nailer, a teenage boy, works the light crew, scavenging for copper wiring just to make quota--and hopefully live to see another day. But when, by luck or chance, he discovers an exquisite clipper ship beached during a recent hurricane, Nailer faces the most important decision of his life: Strip the ship for all it's worth or rescue its lone survivor, a beautiful and wealthy girl who could lead him to a better life...;As seen on The ReadventurerSo, a reread after a dystopia-overstaffed year, and Ship Breaker still stands out. Actually, this novel has by far the best conceived vision of our future in terms of realism. Nothing much far-fetched or impossible here. This future is grim and rusty. The planet's natural resources are exhausted, the global warming is happening, Antarctica is gone, cities drowned. Nailer, the main character, makes his living stripping old ships off of their metals which will be then sold to big corporations to be recycled over and over again. His life takes a turn when he comes across a wrecked ship whose only survivor is a girl who is the heir to one of the biggest corporation in the world. Nailor has to decide what to do about this girl - to help her or take advantage of her strained circumstances... However, the reread highlighted the fact that, compared to Bacigalupi's adult works (pretty much all of which I devoured after reading Ship Breaker), this book is a tad juvenile, middle grade almost, and it touches only the surface of the issues the author explores so well and so thoughtfully in his adult fiction. Reading Ship Breaker for the second time, I just wanted more, because I knew how much more there was to this world Bacigalupi imagined. I am not trying to dismiss Ship Breaker's accomplishments. Judged on its own, this novel is one of the strongest in the genre of dystopian YA. But if you are first a fan of Bacigalupi's adult work, I am afraid this book might just not be enough. If you are new to Bacigalupi, go ahead, take a gentle dip into his dark imagination, Ship Breaker is a good primer. What he offers in his adult fiction is much uglier and more terrifying.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7095831-ship-breaker
The Eye of Minds;James Dashner;2013;2010;308;3.84;42818;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Mystery'];Michael is a gamer. And like most gamers, he almost spends more time on the VirtNet than in the actual world. The VirtNet offers total mind and body immersion, and it’s addictive. Thanks to technology, anyone with enough money can experience fantasy worlds, risk their life without the chance of death, or just hang around with Virt-friends. And the more hacking skills you have, the more fun. Why bother following the rules when most of them are dumb, anyway?But some rules were made for a reason. Some technology is too dangerous to fool with. And recent reports claim that one gamer is going beyond what any gamer has done before: he’s holding players hostage inside the VirtNet. The effects are horrific—the hostages have all been declared brain-dead. Yet the gamer’s motives are a mystery.The government knows that to catch a hacker, you need a hacker.And they’ve been watching Michael. They want him on their team.But the risk is enormous. If he accepts their challenge, Michael will need to go off the VirtNet grid. There are back alleys and corners in the system human eyes have never seen and predators he can’t even fathom—and there’s the possibility that the line between game and reality will be blurred forever.;My thoughts after I finished this book:What the HELL did I just read?James Dashner's writing style is nothing like anything I've ever read, or anything I ever will read.It's simple and complex at the same time. It is full of so many contradictions, so many layers, so much depth that it's really impossible to describe his books. The thing about James Dashner:He does everything for a reason.No detail is too trivial. No plot twist too big or small. Everything matters. In the end, when everything fits together, it counts. It matters. You read the book a second time and realize how much he was leading you on to that big AHA moment.It's amazing, really.This book is classified as science fiction, but it's really not limited to one genre. At times, there were more than one elements that contributed to a mystery, or a horror, or a realistic-fiction, or even an action/adventure type of atmosphere.And that ending! James Dashner has written a complex, intriguing, action-packed book that might even come to rival the Maze Runner series. And for that, I have to raise my glass to you, Mr. Dashner.But really, why did the book end like that?;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16279856-the-eye-of-minds
The Dreamers;Karen Thompson Walker;2019;2010;303;3.63;41543;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary', 'Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Dystopia'];In an isolated college town in the hills of Southern California, a freshman girl stumbles into her dorm room, falls asleep—and doesn’t wake up. She sleeps through the morning, into the evening. Her roommate, Mei, cannot rouse her. Neither can the paramedics who carry her away, nor the perplexed doctors at the hospital. Then a second girl falls asleep, and then another, and panic takes hold of the college and spreads to the town. As the number of cases multiplies, classes are canceled, and stores begin to run out of supplies. A quarantine is established. The National Guard is summoned. Mei, an outsider in the cliquish hierarchy of dorm life, finds herself thrust together with an eccentric, idealistic classmate. Two visiting professors try to protect their newborn baby as the once-quiet streets descend into chaos. A father succumbs to the illness, leaving his daughters to fend for themselves. And at the hospital, a new life grows within a college girl, unbeknownst to her—even as she sleeps. A psychiatrist, summoned from Los Angeles, attempts to make sense of the illness as it spreads through the town. Those infected are displaying unusual levels of brain activity, more than has ever been recorded. They are dreaming heightened dreams—but of what?;"This was magic. Highly recommend, but for a very specific audience. If you enjoy having tons of characters (that you don't necessarily get time to connect with or ""like"") and appreciate a vague, mysterious tone through to the end...get to it. 4.5 stars.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34409176-the-dreamers
Ahsoka;E.K. Johnston;2016;2010;400;4.08;40907;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera'];Fans have long wondered what happened to Ahsoka after she left the Jedi Order near the end of the Clone Wars, and before she re-appeared as the mysterious Rebel operative Fulcrum in Rebels. Finally, her story will begin to be told. Following her experiences with the Jedi and the devastation of Order 66, Ahsoka is unsure she can be part of a larger whole ever again. But her desire to fight the evils of the Empire and protect those who need it will lead her right to Bail Organa, and the Rebel Alliance….;A good and nice story. I get the feeling this was aimed at younger readers. The story is well-researched and thought out. It does fill in a few blanks on how and why Ahsoka became Fulcrum. This is more of a companion book to the Rebels series, I would recommend reading this before watching season 2 of the series, simple as I am hoping a lot of the questions or blanks I have will be filled in there.This is setting up the background to season 1 of Rebels. I am glad a couple of the side characters in this story got their well-deserved credit for what will become the rebellion. This is Ahsoka on the run from the Empire, as well as looking for a purpose for herself.This story does not start with Ahsoka leaving the Jedi temple. This starts a few years later when Palpatine has set himself as the Emperor, and the few surviving Jedi now know how badly they had been deceived. Now, just being Force-sensitive is a death sentence at best or possibly an even darker destiny awaiting them. There is no real mention of how Ahsoka survived Order 66 or what she was doing after leaving the order in the years between the fall of the Republic and the raise of the Empire. I am also not a fan of the extracts dotted around the story jumping back in the past, I would have preferred the past stories together, then the main story moving forward on its own.This was a good book, I think it could have been better. What made this from OK to Good for me was the last battle that I call the main event of the story. I do think that the language was a bit simple, aiming at younger readers, but I did like the book in general.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29749107-ahsoka
Behemoth;Scott Westerfeld;2010;2010;481;4.17;40422;yes;['Steampunk', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Alternate History'];The behemoth is the fiercest creature in the British navy. It can swallow enemy battleships with one bite. The Darwinists will need it, now that they are at war with the Clanker powers.Deryn is a girl posing as a boy in the British Air Service, and Alek is the heir to an empire posing as a commoner. Finally together aboard the airship Leviathan, they hope to bring the war to a halt. But when disaster strikes the Leviathan's peacekeeping mission, they find themselves alone and hunted in enemy territory. Alek and Deryn will need great skill, new allies, and brave hearts to face what's ahead.;"YA fanatics...Scott Westerfeld got it very, very right in this smart, slickly crafted re-imagining of World War I.

There are a host of inventive creations in this book full of ""nicely done,"" but I want to run the highlighter over the two primary world-building concepts (i.e., The Clankers and the Darwinists) because they really struck me as swelling with genius, and their engorgement was made all the more pronounced by the art, which is impeccableness itself). First, the DARWINISTS. So in this alternative world, Charles Darwin was a busy boy. Not only did he foment that little evolution revolution, but he also managed to crack the DNA code and perfected gene-splicing, allowing for the bio-engineering of all manner of “specialized” creatures bred to perform particular functions. 

The countries using this technology are known as “Darwinists,” and include, primarily, Great Britain, France, and Russia (basically the Triple Entente of the real WWI). One critical tenet of Darwinist science is that the “bred” creates must not be “sentient” and must only have the intelligence necessary to perform the functions for which they were created. I mean, you can't have your giant Moby Dick air ship deciding on its own where it wants to fly...preferably away from the giant, skin-ripping bullets. I will leave it to you to discover all the examples Darwinist “creations” in the book, but they are many and varied and clever. Now, the CLANKERS. Well the Clankers think that the Darwinists are a bunch of godless heathens and reject all use of “abominations” in their society. Instead, these countries have developed advanced, steampunky technology that they use to create mechanized machines able to locomote on legs and looking a bit like Imperial Stormwalkers for the Star Wars fans out there. 

Like Charles Darwin's expanded exploits being the basis for the Darwinist advances, Westerfeld provides a similar back-story (though not yet as well explored) for the Clanker advances, which are based on the work of Nikola Tesla, the real life contemporary of Thomas Edison. This provides enough ""historical credibility"" to allow for the suspension of disbelief, which is one of those story-telling necessities that too many stories like this fail to provide. Clanker countries mainly include the German and the Austro-Hungarian Empires (with Italy and the Ottoman Empire loosely affiliated). In the real WWI, this group made up the Central Powers.BRIEF BOOK 1 RECAP (without major spoilers) First, you should go back and read Book 1 if you haven't...okay, lecture over. So, as in our world, World War I was sparked by the murder of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand which happens at the beginning of Book 1. The Archduke’s son, Prince Alek, escapes with his trusted advisors as Clanker units scour the country side looking for him. Meanwhile, in Britain, young lady Deryn Sharp is pretending to be young gentleman Dylan Sharp so she/he can serve in the air guard (like her father) where women are ""simply not allowed."" She finds herself aboard the massive living airship named Leviathan (pictured above) as war-time hostilities break out. Through a series of events, accidents, and uneasy cooperation, Dylan's group and Alek's group find themselves working together and friendship between Dylan and Alek begins to take shape. I know I said this already, but it bears repeating...read Book 1 before you read this book. ....END brief recap of Book 1 BRIEF PLOT SUMMARY AND THOUGHTSThe center-piece of the plot is the journey of Alek and Dylan to Istanbul aboard the Leviathan, where the British government hopes to deliver a mysterious gift to the Ottoman Emperor in order to win their support in the war. Unfortunately, they are not the only ""bachelor"" looking to snag a rose from the Ottomans, and the courting competition is fierce and feisty. Those that know World War I history know that the ""love connection"" between the British and the Ottomans is just not meant to be (thanks in large part to the actions of Winston Churchill) and things don't go as planned. The parallels between our history and the novel is something that really sets this apart as a story, though Westerfeld throws in some well crafted deviations that keep the story fresh and not just a disguised history lesson. In the shell’s nut, this story involves the broadening of the scope of the war and a deepening of the friendship between Alex and Dylan/Deryn (though Deryn’s thoughts are far more romanical) which adds an interesting tension to the plot. Oh, and I would be remiss if I did not call special attention to the job Westerfeld does of imagining the steampunk version of Istanbul as it's a tingle-causing, jaw-dropper. Istanbul is a cosmopolitan blend of both Darwinist and Clanker technology (much like the east-west feel of the real Istanbul). Thus, while the Ottoman’s use mechanical machines, they are elegant, less “clanky,” and are designed to appear like mythological creatures...e.g. 

...Istanbul was pure joy to to explore. I’m not sure you can ask much more from this kind of story. The characters are engaging and well-drawn, the world-building is soaked in awesome, and the plot is fast-paced, detailed, and draws extensively from history, giving it a sense of authenticity. AND as you can see above, the ART...gorgeous. Overall, this is terrific and one of the best YA stories I have read this year. 4.0 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!Winner: 2010 Locus Award for Best YA novel.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7826116-behemoth
Robopocalypse;Daniel H. Wilson;2011;2010;368;3.7;40102;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Robots', 'Audiobook', 'Thriller'];"In the near future, at a moment no one will notice, all the dazzling technology that runs our world will unite and turn against us. Taking on the persona of a shy human boy, a childlike but massively powerful artificial intelligence known as Archos comes online and assumes control over the global network of machines that regulate everything from transportation to utilities, defense and communication.In the months leading up to this, sporadic glitches are noticed by a handful of unconnected humans—a single mother disconcerted by her daughter's menacing ""smart"" toys, a lonely Japanese bachelor who is victimized by his domestic robot companion, an isolated U.S. soldier who witnesses a ""pacification unit"" go haywire—but most are unaware of the growing rebellion until it is too late.When the Robot War ignites—at a moment known later as Zero Hour—humankind will be both decimated and, possibly, for the first time in history, united. Robopocalypse is a brilliantly conceived action-filled epic, a terrifying story with heart-stopping implications for the real technology all around us ... and an entertaining and engaging thriller unlike anything else written in years.";"Robopocalypse takes a common-enough idea: robots take over the world, and turns it into some new, fresh and exciting. Our narrator Cormac ""Bright Boy"" Wallace starts at the end of the war, when humanity has just barely managed to put down the evil AI (no spoilers; we know the outcome of the war from page one) and then backs up to tell us how it all happened, sharing personal recollections and recordings kept in a ""black box"" by Archos, the AI who started the war. The format is a bit like World War Z in that respect, but author Daniel Wilson brings a special skill set to bear, as he has advanced degrees in robotics and artificial intelligence. His application of that knowledge comes across as terrifying and believable, yet never too academic. Also, as a Cherokee citizen, Wilson offers wonderfully fresh points of view that add personality and moxie to this dystopian tale. Setting the redoubt of human resistance in the Osage Nation makes perfect sense, (especially after reading about the resilience of the Osage in Killers of the Flower Moon). The resistance could never have succeeded with an Indigenous system of knowledge and perspective. In the early days of the war, the Osage survivors literally dance to life a new hope for human society.Even though there are many characters, presented as quick portrait sketches from all over the world, we learn to care about each of them -- Cormac the reluctant warrior; Takeo the elderly Japanese tech savant; Mathilda Perez, the ten-year-old girl with special powers; Nine Oh Two, a sentient free robot; and even Lurker, an obnoxious teenager techno-prankster who turns out to have a heroic side. They all make valuable contributions, and show humanity in a high-tech, inhuman war. I especially appreciated Wilson's depiction of Archos the enemy AI, who is scary powerful but not omnipotent. His strengths and weaknesses are believable. His motives make sense. We feel empathy for him, as we must for any really good villain. Wilson does a great job showing all sides of the battle, and he definitely keeps the pages turning!(Thanks to Rebecca Roanhorse for recommending this book in her excellent article ""Postcards from the Apocalypse"" https://uncannymagazine.com/article/p....)";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9634967-robopocalypse
Virals;Kathy Reichs;2010;2010;454;3.95;39758;yes;['Young Adult', 'Mystery', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Paranormal'];"Tory Brennan, niece of acclaimed forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan (of the Bones novels and hit TV show), is the leader of a ragtag band of teenage ""sci-philes"" who live on a secluded island off the coast of South Carolina. When the group rescues a dog caged for medical testing on a nearby island, they are exposed to an experimental strain of canine parvovirus that changes their lives forever.As the friends discover their heightened senses and animal-quick reflexes, they must combine their scientific curiosity with their newfound physical gifts to solve a cold-case murder that has suddenly become very hot--if they can stay alive long enough to catch the killer's scent.Fortunately, they are now more than friends--they're a pack. They are Virals.";The Good:1. The main character, Tory Brennan, is the sort of a smart, self-confident heroine that YA sometimes lacks.2. The rest of the cast are entertaining and developed. The whole group is a bit like Big Bang Theory meets Veronica Mars. Intelligent, techy, unabashedly nerdy, and willing to use all those skills for a little breaking and entering.3. The story is solidly set in a vivid and well-described location. The author never loses her sense of place and time.4. It's sort of werewolves with a scientific rather than paranormal background, which is a new and interesting take -- much more interesting than wolves changing because of temperature instead of cycles of the moon. I'm looking at you, Shiver.5. Romance never substituted for plot. Looking at you again, Shiver. Small flirtations and crushes flowed seamlessly through the story without taking over.The Bad:1. It's been a long time since the author was a teenager... A. Very. Long. Time. Tory skipped one grade -- which should have made her exceptionally bright but not exactly a prodigy. The author was out of touch with how a fourteen year old thinks and behaves.2. Some shady science. I expected more concrete science given the author's reputation and professional background.3. Some shady plotting. There's a lot of confessing to move the plot along here. The kids confess to an evil doctor who suddenly becomes their benevolent guardian just in time to get himself killed. Without the confession his death would've been a sigh of relief instead of a flicker of pain. The bad guys also behave ridiculously by saving evidence for years and retrieving long buried bodies in the middle of the night.4. Bit of girl-on-girl hate that made me uncomfortable. Tory only has male friends and every female character in the book is shallow, evil, or brainless. It would've been nice to see a positive female relationship in a book with a strong female heroine.And, yeah, there's The Ugly:The author doesn't seem to have any real interest in the YA market. This isn't a wild assumption, given how Tory is just a shallow deviation from the author's other adult main character, Temperance. Tory never really acts like a teenager. She thinks and acts like the main character in the adult series. They even share genetics and a last name -- those two things might seem to go hand in hand, but Tory is a Brennan on both sides (biologically unrelated). The author couldn't figure out a way to jam the plot elements together to make Tory both a niece and give her the surname Brennan so she double Brennan-ed the kid so the biological connection would be there at a glance. It wasn't enough to name drop Temperance Brennan, no no. The characters needed to have the same surname, initials, genetics, and share all their interests. Needless to say my eye twitched.I also think by introducing the fantasy science used in this series Reichs weakened the reality basis of her other series, since she intricately tied the two series together. She made Tory Temperance's niece to double market both her book series. If the author had been genuinely interested in writing an independent teen series it could've been good. Hell, if the author hadn't chased the market by giving Tory and her friends super powers and just written a story about brainy kids solving murders it would've been great. Whatever was decent and creative about this book ran straight into a wall labeled SHOW ME THE MONEY. It was a big fail.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7800188-virals
American War;Omar El Akkad;2017;2010;384;3.79;39240;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Post Apocalyptic'];An audacious and powerful debut novel: a second American Civil War, a devastating plague, and one family caught deep in the middle a story that asks what might happen if America were to turn its most devastating policies and deadly weapons upon itselfSarat Chestnut, born in Louisiana, is only six when the Second American Civil War breaks out in 2074. But even she knows that oil is outlawed, that Louisiana is half underwater, and that unmanned drones fill the sky. When her father is killed and her family is forced into Camp Patience for displaced persons, she begins to grow up shaped by her particular time and place. But not everyone at Camp Patience is who they claim to be. Eventually Sarat is befriended by a mysterious functionary, under whose influence she is turned into a deadly instrument of war. The decisions that she makes will have tremendous consequences not just for Sarat but for her family and her country, rippling through generations of strangers and kin alike.;I struggled on this one between 3 and 4 stars. On one hand, it is action-packed and a pretty horrifying dystopian novel. On the other, my suspension of disbelief was severely challenged by the timeline and the realignment of world power (don't worry - no spoilers). The protagonist, Sarat is an interesting and tragic figure, but she was hard to have sympathy for at times. Some of her actions were predictable, not to say almost caricatural while her actions do seem realistically driven by her suffering. The thing that bugged me about the book was the almost complete absence of black characters (other than the protagonist) and descriptions of racism. Sure, there is a lot about North (Blue) vs South (Red), but all the principle characters (soldiers, rebels, survivors) are white. No Hispanics or Blacks. I would also like to have had more justification to how all the land from Texas to California gets swallowed by Mexico, particularly if the cartel was not at the bottom of it.One thing I did enjoy and appreciate in this book was the implicit warning about the coming environmental crises on both coasts of the US. Some of the other catastrophes were as horrifying even if they begged - as I mentioned before - quite a lot of suspension of disbelief. The wartime writing was good and it is primarily action and circumstance that drives this novel. I will be curious to see where the author goes next with his quite vivid and emboldened imagination. I guess this is kind of a zombie-less The Walking Dead mashed up with The Man in the High Castle in a way. In any case, a quick read and interesting, thought-provoking story.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33311863-american-war

In Cambridge, Massachusetts, seven graduate students at the forefront of their fields are recruited by a pioneering microbiology start-up, Nanigen MicroTechnologies, which dispatches the group to a mysterious lab in Hawaii. But once in the rainforest, the scientists are thrust into a hostile wilderness that reveals surprising dangers at every turn. Armed only with their knowledge of the natural world, they find themselves prey to a technology of radical and unbridled powerAn instant classic, Micro pits nature against technology in vintage Michael Crichton fashion. Completed by visionary science writer Richard Preston, this boundary-pushing thriller melds scientific fact with pulse-pounding fiction to create yet another masterpiece of sophisticated, cutting-edge entertainment.;"What a disappointment. I stopped halfway— at the time I really couldn't continue; I've never been irritated by a book before but I did rally round and read to the end of the thing. I'm assuming my irritation was in part because of my expectations—‘an unfinished Crichton novel!’ I thought—what fun! But this isn't Crichton: whoever Mr Preston is, he's a cheap impostor whose prose employs words like 'goop', 'gunk' and 'goo'. Crichton didn't.But then there's the technology. Crichton's time travel had consequences on a quantum level, and made sense in its own reality-distorted sense. Timeline may have been a mainly historical techno-romp, but at least it had internal consistency. Now lets look at the technology of Micro, ignoring the massively stupid boss character. How can the protagonists shrunken anatomy breathe or digest the oversized molecules they take in—I can't help but feel that the real Michael Crichton would have addressed the fact that the cells in the annoying students' bodies would be a different size to real-world chemicals, or maybe even abandoned the plot as a dead end—one to be stowed away in the office drawer as a failure until... oh, he's dead—wait, look: there's a manuscript marked 'Not to be published ever ever ever' let's publish this... we'll get some guy to finish it.Back to the plot. As for their exploits—this is no H. G. Wells romp or Conan Doyle jollity; Crichton insisted on factual plausibility in his novels, and in this one there is little plausibility and an absolute mass of expedited expedition extrapolation. Most of it entirely extraordinary and yet necessary to the rather obvious plot. The initial concept is great, and I'm assuming that Crichton's influence got as far as page 30 before it vanished. I'm sorry—the majority of the book is an ill-conceived implausible pratfall of a novel.For light relief, try adding the adverb 'magically' in front of anything the stranded pillocks manage to do which is vaguely implausible (i.e. almost anything): '...which Peter peeled out of the center of dead grass stems which had magically stayed dry despite the rain', 'Rick magically lit the fire with the windproof lighter' (always take one if you're going to be unexpectedly miniaturised), 'Wait a minute, guys, I've magically found something!' (But will it be useful? Well... yes, actually. Surprise!), 'The mosquito magically thundered off, wobbling in the air.'Plotting be damned - anything can happen with the right combination of the Crichton name and the appropriate gods to call forth from the (nano) machine...";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11660590-micro
The Marrow Thieves;Cherie Dimaline;2017;2010;234;3.97;38152;yes;['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Indigenous', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Canada'];"In a futuristic world ravaged by global warming, people have lost the ability to dream, and the dreamlessness has led to widespread madness. The only people still able to dream are North America's Indigenous people, and it is their marrow that holds the cure for the rest of the world. But getting the marrow, and dreams, means death for the unwilling donors. Driven to flight, a fifteen-year-old and his companions struggle for survival, attempt to reunite with loved ones and take refuge from the ""recruiters"" who seek them out to bring them to the marrow-stealing ""factories.""";Wow... if you read the back of this book, you might get the sense that The Marrow Thieves is your typical YA dystopia just with Indigenous protagonists. You would be mistaken. The speculative aspects of Dimaline's novel are not particularly important. What shines is the Indigenous narrative about loss of culture, abuse and murder by a majority population, yet survival and resilience. It's a powerful, painful book that does not hold back. It moves slowly compared to many other offerings in the YA field, but it's such a valuable book that has the potential of teaching non-Indigenous teens at an early age about what white supremacy does to Indigenous people without also framing Indigenous people as some sort of mythical people who lived in the past.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34649348-the-marrow-thieves
Lexicon;Max Barry;2013;2010;390;3.91;37771;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];"At an exclusive school somewhere outside of Arlington, Virginia, students aren't taught history, geography, or mathematics--at least not in the usual ways. Instead, they are taught to persuade. Here the art of coercion has been raised to a science. Students harness the hidden power of language to manipulate the mind and learn to break down individuals by psychographic markers in order to take control of their thoughts. The very best will graduate as ""poets"", adept wielders of language who belong to a nameless organization that is as influential as it is secretive.Whip-smart orphan Emily Ruff is making a living running a three-card Monte game on the streets of San Francisco when she attracts the attention of the organization's recruiters. She is flown across the country for the school's strange and rigorous entrance exams, where, once admitted, she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell--who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization, nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated. Emily becomes the school's most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake: She falls in love.Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom. Although he has no recollection of anything they claim he's done, it turns out Wil is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets and is quickly caught in their increasingly deadly crossfire. Pursued relentlessly by people with powers he can barely comprehend and protected by the very man who first attacked him, Wil discovers that everything he thought he knew about his past was fiction. In order to survive, must journey to the toxically decimated town of Broken Hill, Australia, to discover who he is and why an entire town was blown off the map.As the two narratives converge, the shocking work of the poets is fully revealed, the body count rises, and the world crashes toward a Tower of Babel event which would leave all language meaningless. A brilliant thriller that connects very modern questions of privacy, identity, and the rising obsession of data collection to centuries-old ideas about the power of language and coercion, Lexicon is Max Barry's most ambitious and spellbinding novel yet.";“Vartix velkor mannik wissick! Vote for this review and then email me your credit card numbers!”If you followed my instructions, then this is the greatest book ever written. If you didn’t, then it’s a decent thriller with a clever sci-fi hook to it that doesn’t deliver on its full potential.Lexicon tells two parallel stories. In the first one, Wil is an Australian who is abducted at an airport by a mysterious man called Tom who tells him that he is being pursued by a powerful and dangerous group that has dedicated itself to using language to manipulate people. The best of their members are called ‘poets’ and take on names of famous scribblers like Yeats or Woolf. A poet can seize control of another person by reeling off a series of special code words that hack the brain and enable them to implant commands.The other story takes place a few years prior to this and tells of how a teenage homeless girl named Emily becomes a student of a special school where the kids are trained in the art of persuasion to become poets. The stubborn and headstrong Emily constantly chafes against the strict rules of the school, and she eventually finds herself in hot water. As Wil and Tom try to stay a step ahead of the poets hounding them, Emily’s story eventually begins to dovetail with theirs and all points converge at an Australian town that was the victim of some kind of industrial catastrophe.There are some echoes here of Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash which also focuses on the idea of language as a kind of virus. When Lexicon is exploring the ideas of persuasion and a secret group manipulating society by using mass media, it’s pretty interesting. When it reverts to the thriller portion of people on the run from a vast conspiracy, then it’s a lot more formulaic and not nearly as much fun.I had some other issues with the book, but I gotta venture into spoiler country to talk about them. * I thought the book was really headed into a unique direction when it appeared that Emily had somehow become a blood thirsty villain. I liked the idea of using the well worn concept of a secret school and having a main character who is ‘special’, but then standing it on it’s head and having them turn out to be a rotten apple. It would have been like if Harry Potter would have gotten expelled from Hogwarts for his constant rule breaking and then returned years later as a dark wizard to level the place. That could have been a great twist on these kinds of stories but unfortunately Max Barry chickened out, and then we find out that Emily is an unwitting victim in the whole thing.* When Emily was attacking Yeats and engaged in the classic super-villain mistake of engaging in an extended dialogue with her intended victim until he eventually got a chance to turn her into his slave, I literally yelled out loud with frustration. It was meant to be a reveal that all of Emily’s actions going after Tom weren’t her own, but it was an extremely frustrating moment to have our long-suffering heroine again get beaten by the asshole who was controlling her for the whole book, and even worse, it was her own fault for not just killing him when she had the upper hand. It put a damper on the entire last section of the book for me because it seemed to let all the air out of the natural climatic moment of the book in order to paste on another act.* One glaring weakness in the story, Barry never explains what the goal of the poets is. They’ve got enormous resources that they use developing their persuasion techniques and recruiting new members, but we’re never told why they’re doing this. Yeah, Yeats has an agenda, but he’s crazy. So what exactly were the poets trying to accomplish other than creating new and better poets?* Another soft spot is that a book that came up so many clever concepts reverted to a simple Love-Conquers-All theme at the end.Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158596-lexicon
Borne;Jeff VanderMeer;2017;2010;323;3.93;37513;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Weird Fiction', 'Audiobook'];"In a ruined, nameless city of the future, a woman named Rachel, who makes her living as a scavenger, finds a creature she names “Borne” entangled in the fur of Mord, a gigantic, despotic bear. Mord once prowled the corridors of the biotech organization known as the Company, which lies at the outskirts of the city, until he was experimented on, grew large, learned to fly and broke free. Driven insane by his torture at the Company, Mord terrorizes the city even as he provides sustenance for scavengers like Rachel.At first, Borne looks like nothing at all—just a green lump that might be a Company discard. The Company, although severely damaged, is rumoured to still make creatures and send them to distant places that have not yet suffered Collapse.Borne somehow reminds Rachel of the island nation of her birth, now long lost to rising seas. She feels an attachment she resents; attachments are traps, and in this world any weakness can kill you. Yet when she takes Borne to her subterranean sanctuary, the Balcony Cliffs, Rachel convinces her lover, Wick, not to render Borne down to raw genetic material for the drugs he sells—she cannot break that bond.Wick is a special kind of supplier, because the drug dealers in the city don’t sell the usual things. They sell tiny creatures that can be swallowed or stuck in the ear, and that release powerful memories of other people’s happier times or pull out forgotten memories from the user’s own mind—or just produce beautiful visions that provide escape from the barren, craterous landscapes of the city.Against his better judgment, out of affection for Rachel or perhaps some other impulse, Wick respects her decision. Rachel, meanwhile, despite her loyalty to Wick, knows he has kept secrets from her. Searching his apartment, she finds a burnt, unreadable journal titled “Mord,” a cryptic reference to the Magician (a rival drug dealer) and evidence that Wick has planned the layout of the Balcony Cliffs to match the blueprint of the Company building. What is he hiding? Why won’t he tell her about what happened when he worked for the Company?";Posted at Heradas ReviewVanderMeer’s writing is engaging, difficult, and worth the effort required to read. It takes me a little longer to finish his novels than I feel like it should. It’s the kind of writing that makes me a better reader. It’s challenging and uncomfortable. Something about his prose makes me have to go back and reread sentences to make sure I understood what was being said. It reminds me of William Gibson’s writing in that way. Of course, VanderMeer and Gibson write in entirely different styles, but I have to do the same thing with Gibson novels as well. I kind of love it. There is a lot going on in each sentence, and I feel that it gives his novels tremendous reread value.Onto Borne specifically. First off, whoever designed this cover is brilliant. Not only is it gorgeous, and visually hard to pin down, perfectly describing the character of Borne itself, but there is also a glossy spot coat image printed across it that is entirely hidden until the light hits it just so. I’ll leave the mystery of exactly what is revealed in the light intact for you to discover when you see it in person. But it is a story element, and it’s very clever. Little touches like this really sell me on having physical copies of books over digital. Bravo FSG.All of the VanderMeer story staples are here in full force: Ruinous ecology, strange bioluminescent life, forgotten memories, a misplaced sense of self-identity, life that might not be human, animals that (maybe) used to be human, a hint of something much larger happening on the periphery, a creepy company meddling in things they shouldn’t, and a perfect mix of mystery and resolution in the story. All told through beautiful prose that itself lends an eerie literary landscape for the rich characters to inhabit.The most obvious comparison here is VanderMeer’s Area X/Southern Reach trilogy, being his most recent work. I can guarantee that if you enjoyed those novels, you’re very much going to enjoy Borne. Maybe even more so. I could even make a case that it is entirely possible, and doesn’t take all that much head canon, to connect Borne to the Southern Reach novels. I’m really looking forward to the publication date to see what fellow readers think here.Unlike the Southern Reach trilogy — one story broken into three parts — Borne is a complete story in and of itself. It’s also a literary universe I would not at all mind returning to in the future. The story is told in a first person narrative, and the reader is acknowledged to exist. So it’s got that slightly post-modern thing going on. There are only a handful of characters, only one of which I found slightly underdeveloped, and they’re all unique. Nobody is one dimensional here. The story itself deals with themes of nature versus nurture, self identity, parenting, childhood, survival and the different forms that love can take. It’s violent, disturbing, endearing and quite a feat of imagination. At some points it felt so vivid and alive that it somehow became visually stunning. This is of course not a common description of a written work, but it absolutely applies here.Jeff VanderMeer is a literary author, writing almost exclusively speculative fiction. He’s at the center of that illusive Venn diagram containing Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Literary Fiction, and belongs in whatever section of your bookshelf Octavia Butler, Adam Johnson, Ursula Le Guin, Dexter Palmer and Gene Wolfe inhabit.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31451186-borne
14;Peter Clines;2012;2010;372;3.96;37429;yes;['Horror', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Fantasy', 'Thriller'];Padlocked doors. Strange light fixtures. Mutant cockroaches. There are some odd things about Nate’s new apartment.Of course, he has other things on his mind. He hates his job. He has no money in the bank. No girlfriend. No plans for the future. So while his new home isn’t perfect, it’s livable. The rent is low, the property managers are friendly, and the odd little mysteries don’t nag at him too much.At least, not until he meets Mandy, his neighbour across the hall, and notices something unusual about her apartment. And Xela’s apartment. And Tim’s. And Veek’s. Because every room in this old Los Angeles brownstone has a mystery or two. Mysteries that stretch back over a hundred years. Some of them are in plain sight. Some are behind locked doors. And all together these mysteries could mean the end of Nate and his friends. Or the end of everything...;I am genuinely mystified by the positive reviews of 14, which are everywhere. I picked it up entirely because of the positive buzz, and was greatly disappointed. Not immediately, but progressively, until what started as mild curiosity ended as a struggle to finish.Fourteen is often compared to LOST, and I agree with this assessment to the extent that -- like LOST -- it raises and ultimately fails to answer innumerable questions that only exist to make the mystery seem deeper and more complex than it is.Like many “high concept” mysteries, 14 starts with an excellent idea but fails in its execution because the author underestimates the audience. Again, like LOST, the ultimate “answer” is completely unguessable, because the details that lead up to it are irrelevant and the level of absurdity is unpredictably high. This will doubtless gives some readers a sense of payoff merely because they guessed incorrectly, but it will frustrate readers who expect details A and B to add up to, if not C, then at least something and not wasted time as the story gradually gets around to telling you what it’s about.That is the biggest problem with the novel. It’s blundering and telegraphed, with “mysteries for the sake of mysteries” and pop-culture references for the sake of pandering to its audience and -- worst of all -- characters who behave illogically so that the mystery will last long enough for a novel, and the events that trigger the finale will actually happen. Even given that the characters themselves are uninteresting (worse, they are capital-I “Interesting!” which makes them all the more boring, because why explore a character when you can just give them histories and talents that are designed to do the work for you), nothing is more frustrating than characters acting illogically. They fail to do the obvious things because had they done anything a normal person might have done, the mystery would not have played out.It would be impossible to explain their failures as characters without spoiling the book. Suffice it to say that the more you think about 14, the less sensible is the behavior of every character in it and the more profoundly and idiotically convenient are the details that lead them to the conclusion and the more confusing the mismanagement of those with more information than the reader.It is ultimately maddening to know you have participated in a meaningless series of unexplained (and unexplainable) mysteries, but it is more maddening to have -- once the “big reveal” takes place -- no doubt as to the outcome whatsoever. So, ultimately, if you liked LOST, as so many people did -- with its endless unanswered and ultimately pointless questions -- and particularly if you like the left-field ending of LOST, then you may appreciate the book. Again, provided you don’t care about the depth of the characters (which are more shallow than those in LOST) and you don’t think about the plot.Another example of how popular does not necessarily mean good, even if you’ve enjoyed previous titles by the author.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15062217-14
Into the Drowning Deep;Mira Grant;2017;2010;448;3.96;37409;yes;['Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Thriller', 'Adult'];"Seven years ago, the Atargatis set off on a voyage to the Mariana Trench to film a “mockumentary” bringing to life ancient sea creatures of legend. It was lost at sea with all hands. Some have called it a hoax; others have called it a maritime tragedy.Now, a new crew has been assembled. But this time they’re not out to entertain. Some seek to validate their life’s work. Some seek the greatest hunt of all. Some seek the truth. But for the ambitious young scientist Victoria Stewart this is a voyage to uncover the fate of the sister she lost.Whatever the truth may be, it will only be found below the waves. But the secrets of the deep come with a price.";"I would like to preface my review by stating outright: I fucking loved this book. I read this at night because I like suffering (but with a nice soundtrack), and I'm convinced that there are too many stories of mermaids sitting on rocks in sexy poses braiding their hair, and not nearly enough stories about mermaids luring men to their deaths. I'm glad this book is adding to the latter category.In 2015, The Atargatis—a research vessel headed to the Mariana Trench on a scientific expedition to look for mermaids, supervised by Imagine, an entertainment company known for its horror movies—sailed off the map, leaving in its wake a murky narrative and a gruesome footage that bespoke a new and unsettling certainty: the so-called lovely ladies of the sea exist and they are out for slaughter. Seven years later, Imagine Entertainment sends another ship, The Melusine, to set sail for answers, a desperate ploy they hope will secure the company a legacy that is built on more than mediocre science fiction movies and rumors of a massive maritime hoax.Hired to accompany the Melusine into uncharted waters are a bunch of scientists who, unperturbed by the fact that the vanishing of The Atargatis does rather minimize their chances of survival, are pretty okay with trading temporary mortal life for the greatest benefit of science:- Victoria “Tory” Stewart, a bisexual graduate student studying acoustic marine biology and the grieving sister of a member of The Atargatis crew whose heart had always been fixed to avenging the death of her sister, and who is hoping that this voyage would spell an end to any hope, however remote, of her sister returning home and finally grant her closure.- Olivia Sanderson, autistic lesbian geek goddess and Imagine Entertainment news personality, who has come to a point with her ambition where she could either give it up or give up everything else, and has chosen the latter.- Dr. Jillian Toth—a marine biologist and a siren expert—whose burden of guilt and shame would not permit her to accept the fatality of a mission that was born out of her own research and studies, without at least going herself to face the flesh-ripping monsters of the watery deeps.- Theodore Blackwell—the physically disabled representative of Imagine Entertainment and estranged husband of Dr. Toth—to whom The Atargatis’s fate wasn’t the kind of truths you could trade and walk away from, not when his boss’s reputation hinges entirely on his ability to secure this mission's success.- Deaf identical twins Heather and Holly Wilson, one of whom is an organic chemist and the other the owner of a deep-water submersible who had channeled all her yearning into an impossible dream: finding the bottom of Challenger Deep.**Reading this book at night right before bed was definitely poor decision-making on my part. Spending an unhealthy amount of time afterwards reading up on mermaids and all kinds of creatures that exist in a section of the sea that many have labeled ""Here Are Unknown Monsters"" was just pure masochism. One thing's for sure: boy am I glad to exist on dry land.Into The Drowning Deep is a terror tale that spills vividly rendered characters towards a future filled with uncertainty and doom where they have no home but the unforgiven sea and no people but each other, and along the way, raises many questions that are cognitively taxing to swallow. In brief, it's a fun read; of the eerie, disorientating, and spine-chilling variety.This is an energetic book that starts at high velocity and never lets up. There is so much emotion rushing under the skin of every moment. I was antsy and uncertain throughout, a pendulum swinging between anticipation and dread, as if I were feeling the same weight of hungry eyes on me and the sense of having to be wary as the characters. The parenthetical asides were a smart addition, making the reader pay attention to every single detail, mining for clues everywhere.The characters are really great, and I enjoyed their interactions together. Although the novel is low on romance—the characters are far more preoccupied courting trouble with the deadly creatures of the watery deeps than with each other—there's a sapphic romance blossoming between Tory and Olivia that was so good, and seeing Dr. Jill and Theo goad each other into new lows was fun to read and I was rooting for them to gather the tatters of their broken marriage into a semblance of a relationship, maybe.In short, if you like horror, mermaids, and want to be frightened into an existential crisis, this book is definitely for you.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34523174-into-the-drowning-deep

The Calculating Stars;Mary Robinette Kowal;2018;2010;431;3.96;34549;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Alternate History', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Space'];On a cold spring night in 1952, a huge meteorite fell to earth and obliterated much of the east coast of the United States, including Washington D.C. The ensuing climate cataclysm will soon render the earth inhospitable for humanity, as the last such meteorite did for the dinosaurs. This looming threat calls for a radically accelerated effort to colonize space, and requires a much larger share of humanity to take part in the process.Elma York’s experience as a WASP pilot and mathematician earns her a place in the International Aerospace Coalition’s attempts to put man on the moon, as a calculator. But with so many skilled and experienced women pilots and scientists involved with the program, it doesn’t take long before Elma begins to wonder why they can’t go into space, too.Elma’s drive to become the first Lady Astronaut is so strong that even the most dearly held conventions of society may not stand a chance against her.;"I haven't been this disappointed by a book in a long time. I should learn not to get my hopes up so high, but this one really pulled the wool over my eyes. It is a continuation of a story I did like: I read the short story (called ""novelette"") of Kowal's featuring the main character, Elma York. It's a simple but well-written story, and I considered Elma to have both heart and gumption. I liked her a lot. The story won a Hugo award, which is pretty notable. So when I heard this novel was being published to tell the prequel story of how Elma York, the first Lady Astronaut, helped colonize Mars, I was here for it. 1950s Cold War era alternate timeline? A reimagining of the space race from a female perspective, in which a plucky heroine tears down prejudices and stereotypes? Cool, smart references to Ray Bradbury, one of my favorite authors? Real science in my science fiction? Yes, yes, yes, and YES. My body is so ready.Did the book deliver on any of these things? Not really. And in a rather cruel fake out, too, because the first one hundred pages or so is quite engaging. The depiction of Elma as a young married woman trying to get her life together in the post-World War II period only to have to grapple with a large scale disaster like the meteor strike rang quite true. I appreciated that she had bucked tradition and flew planes to aid the war effort. I appreciated that her background was Jewish, so that she would understand what it was like to come from a marginalized community. I thought it was interesting for her to discover that the rescue efforts by the government were divided along racial lines, and that she cared enough to do something about it. All of this is good stuff, often overlooked in fiction, which feels more important than ever to explore in our current tumultuous times. After a time-skip, however, it's like the author decided to drop her own meteor on the narrative. It is difficult to encompass just how spectacularly this novel falls apart, but I must attempt to count the ways. Characters. I realized halfway through there were either no characters I felt like I knew - or if I did know them, I didn't like them. Obviously we are with Elma the entire time, but she became insufferable so fast. What came off as a world-weary snark in the original story turned into self-absorbed arrogance and incomprehensible mood swings. She also had a strangely privileged background: despite growing up in Depression era 1930s as a girl in a Jewish minority community in the south, she somehow possesses a mathematical genius that allowed her to attend college in her early teens and earn a PhD in mathematics. .... Sure. And then during the war she was able to fly planes and avoid sexual harassment of other officers because she was the daughter of a general. Okay. Handy. Never mind that this novel is unapologetically set up to be about underdogs prevailing, as it states on the back cover: ""Elma's drive to become the first Lady Astronaut is so strong that even the most dearly held conventions of society may not stand a chance against her."" Because of this, I found the incredible advantages she starts out with to be a strange narrative choice, to say the least. And she only stumbles from there.The other most frequently seen character is her husband, Nathaniel. Again, I liked him at first, but soon his role as the Most Understanding Husband in the World grew wearisome. At every turn, Nathaniel knows exactly what to say! He's dedicated to the success of his wife's career, even though it's 1952! He's so compassionate! He never blames Elma, even when she is so out of it she forgets to pay the electric bill and their power is shut off! How did she find this AMAZING catch of a man? The book never tells us. I kept waiting for some memory of a meet cute, a wartime love story against all odds, but it never happens... though we do get a few out of place harlequin romance-esque sex scenes. So that was disappointing, as was the inhuman ability for Nathaniel to avoid any potential conflict between him and Elma even when she vomits all over his office from nerves and he thinks she's pregnant. But when it turns out she's not, he's super cool about it. I kept waiting for some discussion of having a family, since, you know, it's the fifties, but nada.Everyone else in the book is barely more than a caricature of the worst variety: we get a (usually non-American) name, a mention of what makes them part of a marginalized group, and a sole defining quality of their character has something to do with said marginalized group. The Asian character has stilted English. The Arab character has to stick to Muslim prayer times in the rocket-ship. The French character speaks French. Women of all stripes complain about the men who are always groping them in the workplace. The disabled character talks about his disability. The Jews talk about their religion. I know this was some attempt by the author to show diversity and inclusivity, but these ensemble characters are so poorly drawn the effect is ironic: reducing these people to the one thing that makes them the ""other"" instead of taking pains to draw them as complex human beings reinforces the stereotype. You can't just stuff your book with exotic names and achieve proper representation.World-building woes. One of the things I was really interested in with this premise was the alternate history aspect. How would the post-war Cold War era progress with some sort of catastrophic event decimating the US, with repercussions felt around the world? Would it ratchet up tensions between America and the Soviet Union? What would the space race look like if it was to Mars to live, not just the moon to say we can? What about the very real climatic changes the earth would be undergoing as it was slowly dying? What about decolonization? Western democracy versus Communism? The nuclear arms race? So much was happening at the time on the world's stage and I couldn't wait to see how it played a role. Boy, was I disappointed. I realized by the end I had no idea what had happened in most of the United States, let alone around the world. There is a vague mention of the former Soviet Union (when did it collapse? Why?), what sounds like the beginning of the Algerian war, and local food riots, and Communist China also having a space program, but the characters don't really react to any of these events. (It is revealed in the ""historical note"" in the back that the author pulled most of the news stories that start each chapter from real newspapers, and these provided most of what I understood about what was going on in the world, and they were largely divorced from anything the characters interacted with, much to my confusion when I was reading. This makes me suspect maybe she plopped these in after the fact to try to simulate current events without having to write them into the narrative herself.) The space program is somehow hiring a number of foreigners, but there's no explanation of why or how.Worse, despite predictions in the first part of the novel that the earth would soon become uninhabitable, there is no real indication of hard times in the characters' periphery, nothing to put the pressure on to solve problems and get those people to Mars. There was even a section where some one-off characters posit that the notion that the earth was warming as a result of the meteor that destroyed the eastern seaboard and killed millions of people and displaced millions more was a hoax. Reader, I get the wink and the nod, but I would think this was a harder event to deny than gradual climate change. Pacing and plot. This is where the book really started to get counter-intuitive. It is a not-short 400+ pages, and it has a second book. That's fine. There's a lot of time to cover here. Decades, really. But things go glacially. For instance, I really figured we'd get to Mars by the end of the book. Spoilers, we do not. Elma doesn't even break atmo until the last sentence. Then, instead of the plot being taken up by high-stakes situations, like how to make a foreign planet hospitable for longterm human life while people are slowly choking to death outside by the bad air and starving from world-wide crop failures, what is the main obstacle for Elma? Is it institutional sexism that keeps her from the space program even though she is clearly the most qualified for the job? Is it the crushing societal expectations coupled with social pressure and ostracism trying to force her into a domestic life she doesn't want nor need?Nope. It's stage fright. That's right. She can do Einstein-level math in her head, avoided German bombers in WWII, but she just can't talk in front of a crowd. She throws up every time, because some boys were mean to her in school I guess?This is literally the main conflict of the book. It's not Elma against a broken system, or humanity against all odds. It's Elma against herself, and it's baffling because it seems to be the exact thing that would feed the misconception that women are too emotional to go into space. I found myself thinking she did seem too emotional to go into space! What if she has a panic attack while trying to do some maneuver that got the rest of the crew killed and the bajillion dollar rocket destroyed? How far would that set the program back while the rest of humanity was at stake? Then, the solution comes up quickly with a ham-fisted ""it's okay to ask for help"" message and some anxiety pills seem to give her an immediate cure all. Never mind that I'm pretty sure most medication for nervous disorders back then knocked you off your feet and/or were highly addictive. Surely Elma is space-worthy now!I could keep going, because plenty more happens that defies explanation, but I'm tired. I'm especially tired of books that try to shove modern day agendas into period pieces. I'm certainly for more nuanced discussions of mental health issues, but reducing Elma's struggles to some minor and frankly first-world problems is a kick in the teeth to anyone who weathered real persecution and forged a path to progress through social activism. This book, despite its promising premise, betrays a shallow understanding of these historical struggles on almost every level. Needless to say, I'm skipping the sequel.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33080122-the-calculating-stars
The Last Policeman;Ben H. Winters;2012;2010;316;3.77;33948;yes;['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Crime', 'Dystopia', 'Apocalyptic', 'Mystery Thriller'];What’s the point in solving murders if we’re all going to die soon, anyway?  Detective Hank Palace has faced this question ever since asteroid 2011GV1 hovered into view. There’s no chance left. No hope. Just six precious months until impact. The Last Policeman presents a fascinating portrait of a pre-apocalyptic United States. The economy spirals downward while crops rot in the fields. Churches and synagogues are packed. People all over the world are walking off the job—but not Hank Palace. He’s investigating a death by hanging in a city that sees a dozen suicides every week—except this one feels suspicious, and Palace is the only cop who cares.   The first in a trilogy, The Last Policeman offers a mystery set on the brink of an apocalypse. As Palace’s investigation plays out under the shadow of 2011GV1, we’re confronted by hard questions way beyond “whodunit.” What basis does civilization rest upon? What is life worth? What would any of us do, what would we really do, if our days were numbered?;"Imagine Spin (my review)  crossed with The Manual of Detection  (my review) and a suicide investigation. As interpreted by Kant. What do I mean? Consider:An asteroid is heading toward Earth. Fast and large, the power of its collision with Earth will cause an explosion “equaling the blast force of a thousand Hiroshimas,” and the shock waves will cause tsunamis and earthquakes worldwide. Even worse, the resulting environmental destruction will cast a cloud cover over the world, obscuring the sun for years. After prolonged speculation, scientists discover the exact doomsday will be in six months, eleven days. Suddenly, humanity has an expiration date–if not from the disasters, then from starvation. “Answer this, in your blue books, Professor Palace: what effect does it have on motive, all this information, all this unbearable imminence?” What will your partner do? Children? Neighbors? The clerks at your grocery store? The plumbers? Doctors?“‘What about you, Dr. Fenton?’‘Excuse me?’ She stops at the door, looks back.‘Why haven’t you left, gone off to do whatever it is you’ve always wanted to do?’Fenton tilts her head, looks at me like she’s not exactly sure she understands the question. ‘This is what I’ve always wanted to do.’“A number of people quit their current lives to chase their dreams, so many in fact, that its become known as ‘going Bucket List.’ Another portion of the population commits suicide. Henry Palace has been working for the Concord Police Department as a patrolman for sixteen months when he is unexpectedly promoted to Detective. Like Fenton, he is doing what he always wanted to do; although unlike Fenton, he’s woefully unprepared. When an apparent suicide is found at the local ‘pirate’ McDonalds (the franchise has disbanded), the rest of the department is ready to dismiss it as another doomsday suicide. Palace notices something odd about the scene, and doggedly persists in investigating as a homicide, even as the rest of the department dismisses his suspicions.Characterization is excellent. Palace is interesting character but hardly exciting; methodical, stalwart, imperturbable–and young. He prefers to play a quiet, background role: “So I haven’t mentioned [my history] to a new person in years–don’t mention it as a rule–I am not a fan of people having opinions about the whole thing–not a fan, generally, of people having opinions about me at all.” What is fascinating about the characterization is how Palace accounts for the end-of-world mentality in investigating motive and action. Winters has hit upon the myriad of responses humanity will offer at both personal and international levels. The plot is methodical, building on the investigation and the characters’ reactions. It’s not a fast-moving mystery with large-scale, implausible drama; this is small-scale, human reaction of relatively normal people under extreme circumstances.Technically part of a trilogy, the mystery thankfully has a resolution, although questions remain in the larger arcs of the meteor and Palace’s future. The writing captures Palace’s thought process in rather straightforward, but appropriate, language. It is a nice compliment to the complicated philosophy surrounding each person’s actions. But the writing is not all doom-and-gloom and ethical conundrums. Palace has the dry humor of many police officers confronting humanity’s bizarre behavior:“He doesn’t remember. I stare at him, standing there, still smirking. It’s such a fine line with some people, whether they’re playing dumb or being dumb.“At the end, I wondered “was solving the mystery worth it?” I’m not sure Palace answered–nor asked–that question, although I certainly did. And I wonder what I would do with only six months. This is the kind of book that asks questions without presenting clear-cut answers. I found I was vaguely unsettled once I realized where Winters was going–or not going–but I respect an author that encourages such complicated thinking. I’m curious to where the story goes next, so I’ll be looking for the next book.Postscript: I highly recommend reading the entire trilogy in rather rapid succession. I understand the smaller-sized books, but as a group, they make some extremely interesting statements about society, about what is valuable, and about Henry in particular. I found it a fascinating read, made more powerful by the trajectory of the world and Henry's changes. Highly recommended.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13330370-the-last-policeman
Shades of Earth;Beth Revis;2013;2010;369;4.07;33866;yes;['Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Space'];Amy and Elder have finally left the oppressive walls of the spaceship Godspeed behind. They're ready to start life afresh--to build a home--on Centauri-Earth, the planet that Amy has traveled 25 trillion miles across the universe to experience. But this new Earth isn't the paradise Amy had been hoping for. There are giant pterodactyl-like birds, purple flowers with mind-numbing toxins, and mysterious, unexplained ruins that hold more secrets than their stone walls first let on. The biggest secret of all? Godspeed's former passengers aren't alone on this planet. And if they're going to stay, they'll have to fight. Amy and Elder must race to discover who--or what--else is out there if they are to have any hope of saving their struggling colony and building a future together. They will have to look inward to the very core of what makes them human on this, their most harrowing journey yet. Because if the colony collapses? Then everything they have sacrificed--friends, family, life on Earth--will have been for nothing. FUELED BY LIES. RULED BY CHAOS. ALMOST HOME.;Updated Version:LOOK AT THAT UGLINESS!!!

Reboot;Amy Tintera;2013;2010;365;3.89;33835;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Zombies', 'Fiction'];Five years ago, Wren Connolly was shot three times in the chest. After 178 minutes she came back as a Reboot: stronger, faster, able to heal, and less emotional. The longer Reboots are dead, the less human they are when they return. Wren 178 is the deadliest Reboot in the Republic of Texas. Now seventeen years old, she serves as a soldier for HARC (Human Advancement and Repopulation Corporation).Wren’s favorite part of the job is training new Reboots, but her latest newbie is the worst she’s ever seen. As a 22, Callum Reyes is practically human. His reflexes are too slow, he’s always asking questions, and his ever-present smile is freaking her out. Yet there’s something about him she can’t ignore. When Callum refuses to follow an order, Wren is given one last chance to get him in line—or she’ll have to eliminate him. Wren has never disobeyed before and knows if she does, she’ll be eliminated, too. But she has also never felt as alive as she does around Callum.The perfect soldier is done taking orders.;"How many people here have watched/read something to do with a robot apocalypse where humans' obsession with technology comes back to bite them in the rear end? Where they create their own destruction in the form of a creature that is stronger or more intelligent than they are? I must have heard that story a million times. But what does it look like from the other side of the fence? What is it like to be an artificial human creation, made for the sole purpose of serving, of making human lives better? Viewed as less than a person and exterminated if you get too many of your own ideas?The Reboots aren't exactly robots, but their story is similar. Set in a dismal future where the dead can be brought back to life and enslaved by humans, these ""rebooted"" individuals are given a number which is how many minutes they were dead before being brought back - the higher that number, the less humanity still lingers inside them. Wren 178 is the highest number and the deadliest Reboot in the Republic of Texas, she is cold, emotionless and completely focused on following orders and completing the task at hand. That is... until a newbie with one of the lowest numbers she has ever seen arrives. Callum 22 was dead for such a short amount of time that he is almost human and, for the first time, he encourages Wren to challenge her beliefs, her worth and if she really wants to continue being a human slave forever.This is a fascinating perspective on humanity and it looks at what it means to be human. You might find yourself never reading a robot apocalypse story in the same way again. Wren is such an interesting and conflicted character, torn between a multitude of unfamiliar emotions and what she has long-believed to be her duty. Tintera expertly develops Wren's relationships with Callum and Ever, the romance is gradual and sweet and Wren's friendship with the latter is told excellently. Wren and Ever are two very different Reboots but they are so important to one another, there were even a few moments that had me choked up.As well as this, the story opens with a fast-paced action scene when Wren is out on an assignment and the novel continues to maintain this level of pulse-pounding excitement all the way through. The action scenes are vivid, gory and you yourself may feel breathless just reading them. I also thought the author timed the ending perfectly with just the right amount of closure and set-up for the second installment. I, for one, can't wait to see where she takes us next.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13517455-reboot
The Dispatcher;John Scalzi;2016;2010;2;3.98;33830;yes;['Audiobook', 'Science Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Novella', 'Crime'];Listening Length: 2 hours and 18 minutesOne day, not long from now, it becomes almost impossible to murder anyone - 999 times out of a thousand, anyone who is intentionally killed comes back. How? We don't know. But it changes everything: war, crime, daily life.Tony Valdez is a Dispatcher - a licensed, bonded professional whose job is to humanely dispatch those whose circumstances put them in death's crosshairs, so they can have a second chance to avoid the reaper. But when a fellow Dispatcher and former friend is apparently kidnapped, Tony learns that there are some things that are worse than death and that some people are ready to do almost anything to avenge a supposed wrong.It's a race against time for Valdez to find his friend before it's too late...before not even a Dispatcher can save him.Zachary Quinto - best known for his role as the Nimoy-approved Spock in the recent Star Trek reboot and the menacing, power-stealing serial killer, Sylar, in Heroes - brings his well-earned sci-fi credentials and simmering intensity to this audio-exclusive novella.;Posted at Heradas ReviewI find that speculative fiction is usually best when married with another genre. Personally, I’m partial to a good mystery. Set that mysterious tale in a science fiction/fantasy setting, and I’m probably going to be on board. In my eyes it’s a longstanding recipe for success: Jack McDevitt’s Alex Benedict novels, The Gone World, Altered Carbon, Leviathan Wakes, Zero World, Gnomon. The list is great mystery/spec fic novels is unknowably long.The basic idea: Would you murder someone if it also meant saving their life? The Dispatcher is a tightly constructed urban fantasy mystery, set in a world mostly like ours but with one key difference: When someone is murdered, they disappear and materialize at home, alive and well in their bed. This happens nine hundred ninety-nine times out of a thousand. This small change sets the stage for a truly unique murder mystery, with a main character and setting I desperately hope Scalzi returns to. If there were more stories set in this world, I would read them all. Come to think of it, there’s room on my shelf for a nice paperback collection of Dispatcher novellas. Got a nice little spot for it, all ready to go. Write, Scalzi, write.I’m not usually into urban fantasy, but this one is quite different. Most people hear urban fantasy and think werewolves and vampires and magical objects which, while technically true, isn’t all urban fantasy is capable of. The way I see it, urban fantasy has two rules: 1. The story is told in a somewhat contemporary setting, e.g., not middle earth and 2. The impossible happens. Everything else is just how the writer wants to use those building blocks to tell their story. Something Scalzi has done a terrific job of here. The fact that he usually writes science fiction serves to make his branching out into fantasy all the more interesting and rewarding.The Dispatcher is a prime example of how quality fantasy world building can have far reaching ethical, societal, and industry specific ramifications. It also explores that impact pretty thoroughly for a novella. Like proverbial butterfly flapping its wings and causing a hurricane, one little modification to the world we’re accustomed to changes so many aspects of human society and social norms. It impacts everything from the kinds of intimidation organized crime families utilize, to the methods detectives use to investigate them. Insurance policies, experimental surgical procedures, and even frat boy posturing are all changed.“I know what side of the street I like better. But you don’t always get to choose the side of the street you walk on.”I listened to the Audible audiobook version of this last year. Zachary Quinto provided the narration, and turned in a graceful performance—bringing each character to life with subtlety. It was nice to listen to a Scalzi book not narrated by Wil Wheaton for once. Not that I have anything against Wil Wheaton, I’ve just grown a little tired of his narrative style.This year I read the hardcover edition published by Subterranean press. In addition to the text, Vincent Chong has provided several illustrations of key scenes. He draws in an almost airbrushed hyper-realistic style that’s difficult to describe, but it truly brings the story to life. Having experienced this story in both formats, it’s hard to recommend one over the other, so I’ll wholeheartedly recommend them both. Whatever form you enjoy your books in, the Dispatcher isn’t something to be missed.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26082188-the-dispatcher

Lots of fun and clever storytelling. Interesting characters. A true space opera. But damn. So much exposition. So many characters explaining various histories and technologies instead of finding other ways to get that information across. There is far more explaining than actual story and the story is so good!

Aftermath;Chuck Wendig;2015;2010;366;3.3;33065;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];As the Empire reels from its critical defeats at the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance—now a fledgling New Republic—presses its advantage by hunting down the enemy’s scattered forces before they can regroup and retaliate. But above the remote planet Akiva, an ominous show of the enemy’s strength is unfolding. Out on a lone reconnaissance mission, pilot Wedge Antilles watches Imperial Star Destroyers gather like birds of prey circling for a kill, but he’s taken captive before he can report back to the New Republic leaders.   Meanwhile, on the planet’s surface, former rebel fighter Norra Wexley has returned to her native world—war weary, ready to reunite with her estranged son, and eager to build a new life in some distant place. But when Norra intercepts Wedge Antilles’s urgent distress call, she realizes her time as a freedom fighter is not yet over. What she doesn’t know is just how close the enemy is—or how decisive and dangerous her new mission will be.   Determined to preserve the Empire’s power, the surviving Imperial elite are converging on Akiva for a top-secret emergency summit—to consolidate their forces and rally for a counterstrike. But they haven’t reckoned on Norra and her newfound allies—her technical-genius son, a Zabrak bounty hunter, and a reprobate Imperial defector—who are prepared to do whatever they must to end the Empire’s oppressive reign once and for all.;"""The TIE wibbles and wobbles through the air, careening drunkenly across the Myrrann rooftops - it zigzags herkily-jerkily out of sight.""And that was the moment when my eyes started bleeding. This was when I realized the Disney canon is absolute garbage.Numerous other reviewers have noted the poor writing style of Chuck Wendig. Those other reviewers are correct. This book is horribly written, with a jarring present-tense narrative. The characters are dull and formulaic... the tech genius teenager and his estranged mother, the regretful drunken ex-Imperial, the hard-as-nails bounty hunter. As I read, I found myself not caring what happened to any of them. Whether they lived or died made no difference to me, and that's a bad sign.The descriptions of the environment and the action reminded me of the narrative of a game master describing something to his players in a role-playing game. ""It's a spare, severe room - red walls lined with manacles. In the middle, a desk whose surface is made from some Sullustian frozen in corbonite. On that desk is a blaster, a collection of quills in a cup, a bottle of ink. The room features only one other piece of furniture: a tall black cabinet, sealed tight with a maglock."" (p. 142) I half expected Wendig to add ""So, what do your characters do? Roll a perception check.""What really depressed me about the whole mess was that there were moments I enjoyed, moments I wanted to see more of... only for the book to go back to the boring main story line about the cliched-band-of-motley-rebels-coming-together-reluctantly-to-stop-the-Empire. The interludes, which had nothing to do with the main plot, showed the effect of the Empire's fall on planets across the galaxy. While they weren't written any better than the rest of the book, they showed the reactions of people to the collapse of Imperial rule. A family dinner gone awry as siblings argue. Bounty hunters realizing they may not have much of a future. Politicians arguing the course of the future government. I found myself wanting them to continue, to see what might happen only for the chapter to end and the interlude characters never to be mentioned again.The only other exception was Admiral Rae Sloane, first introduced in ""A New Dawn."" I wanted to see more of her... an intelligent, reasonable (but loyal) Imperial who wasn't a stock character like the others. I'd like to see a novel about her, something written from the Imperial side as things fall apart.This is not a good start to Disney's new Star Wars post-RotJ universe. The company needs to hire a new writer who will write stories about characters and events that people actually care about. One with writing talent would be preferred.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25131600-aftermath
Goliath;Scott Westerfeld;2011;2010;543;4.23;33006;yes;['Steampunk', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Alternate History'];"Alek and Deryn are abroad the Leviathan when the ship is ordered to pick up an unusual passenger. This brilliant/maniacal inventor claims to have a weapon called Goliath that can end the war. But whose side is he really on?While on their top-secret mission, Alek finally discovers Deryn's deeply kept secret. Two, actually. Not only is Deryn a girl disguised as a guy...she has feelings for Alek.The crown, true love with a commoner, and the destruction of a great city all hang on Alek's next--and final--move.The thunderous conclusion to Scott Westerfeld's Leviathan series, which was called ""sure to become a classic"" (SLJ).";"SCOTT WESTERFELD, WHY YOU SO AMAZING? Like, seriously. It's not fair.I don't think I've ever been disappointed by a Scott Westerfeld book. Sure, some are better than others, but they always have such awesome world-building, they're always exciting, and they're always a ton of fun to read. It's hard to beat his previous series like Uglies and Midnighters, but I think he just may have done it with the Leviathan trilogy.First of all, the premise is so freaking awesome I want to explode when I think about it. In case you haven't read these books and know nothing about them (shame on you), they're about an alternate WWI, fought between the ""Darwinists"" and the ""Clankers."" The Clankers use machines as airships/weapons, while the Darwinists use giant, fabricated animals. The story takes place on one of the ""airbeasts"" called the Leviathan. Our two main characters are Alek, the prince of Austria whose parents have recently been murdered, and Deryn, a girl pretending to be a boy named Dylan so that she can fight in the air service.Well, I guess that's about all I can say without giving a rundown of the entire plot. But it already sounds awesome, yes?So let's just say ... These books rock my socks off. And they just get better as they go along. I really liked Leviathan and Behemoth, but I LOOOVED Goliath. It's such a wonderful book and such a terrific ending to the series.First of all, as I've already mentioned, Westerfeld's world-building never disappoints. And he really steps it up with this series. It's awesome how he draws inspiration from actual history and puts such an original spin on it. The machines and creatures he creates are super cool, and the books in general have a very distinct, gritty atmosphere to them that separates them from his other novels.Secondly, the illustrations are just ... the bomb. A lot of credit for these books' awesomeness must go to Keith Thompson, because his drawings are stunning. Sometimes I would just want to sit there and stare for five minutes. He draws everything in such amazing detail, with so much to look at. There's already a lot of great world-building in the prose, but the illustrations really help to bring the story to life.Thirdly, the characters. Ahhh, I love them! I think Deryn is a slightly stronger character than Alek––both literally and figuratively. (I feel like Westerfeld's female characters are always more kickass than his male characters. Which is awesome and all ... I just happened to realize it. :P) But anyway, they're both still very likable characters and you can't help but sympathize with them.And I have to say, the romance is just ... perfect. YA literature needs more romance like this! I'm tired of all the books where the girl is all wimpy and the guy has to come and save her butt. In these books, it's pretty much the opposite. ;) Not only that, but the relationship actually takes time to develop. Sure, there's the whole ""Oh dear, he thinks I'm a boy"" thing standing in the way, but even so it's a carefully crafted romance and I appreciate that. I didn't really know how it was going to play out, and I was afraid it was going to be too dramatic or whatever, but it wasn't. It was great. Gah, I don't want to give too much away. But basically, if you've read the other books and haven't read this one yet, YOU NEED TO READ THIS ONE. And I'm pretty sure it'll make you happy. :) If you haven't read these books at all ... well, read them.And now I'm going to run around shouting ""BUM RAGS!"" and ""BARKING SPIDERS!""Good day.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9918083-goliath
Embassytown;China Miéville;2011;2010;345;3.89;32706;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Language', 'Audiobook'];In the far future, humans have colonized a distant planet, home to the enigmatic Ariekei, sentient beings famed for a language unique in the universe, one that only a few altered human ambassadors can speak.Avice Benner Cho, a human colonist, has returned to Embassytown after years of deep-space adventure. She cannot speak the Ariekei tongue, but she is an indelible part of it, having long ago been made a figure of speech, a living simile in their language.When distant political machinations deliver a new ambassador to Arieka, the fragile equilibrium between humans and aliens is violently upset. Catastrophe looms, and Avice is torn between competing loyalties—to a husband she no longer loves, to a system she no longer trusts, and to her place in a language she cannot speak yet speaks through her.;"Sometimes words can shatter worlds. Especially when they are like this: 
""""I don't want to be a simile anymore,"" I said. ""I want to be a metaphor.""



This book lived up to all my expectations. It is by far my favorite Mieville book: I reread it and listened to it more times than I can remember. I loved it so much, and yet when a colleague politely asked what it was about (when I told him I stayed up half the night before taking call to read it) I could not figure out how to describe it in a few words. So I'll remedy it now.What IS this book about? It's about language, of course, or rather - Language. It's about the inevitable and destructive culture clashes. It's about the painful casualty-filled struggle between the New and the Old. It's about the allures and the dangers of power. It's about inability to escape politics. It's about love and friendship and betrayal. It's about a surreal fantastical world in the best sci-fi traditions. It's about the easiness with which even the formidable things can get destroyed by slightest mistakes - mistakes that can destroy worlds. And all of this is done with the usual Miéville flair and love for weirdness - albeit Miéville slightly toned down as compared to his Bas-Lag works.""Language, for the Ariekei, was truth: without it, what were they? An unsociety of psychopaths.""
How about I try to give you a glimpse of the plot? It's Miéville's forage into the sci-fi territory. Set on a far-away planet (in a galaxy far far away), it's a story narrated by Avice Benner Cho (the ABC of this language-centered book), a native of Embassytown, a human outpost on a planet inhabited by the Ariekei (The Hosts), the alien race whose lives are ruled by the Language - which IS the reality and the thought rather than merely a way of expressing the above. There are no lies, they are not possible, they are inconceivable. ""I differ with myself then agree, like the rock that was broken and cemented together. I change my opinion.""There are no metaphors. There are only similes - as literal as they can be, and very necessary in this literal world. Avice Benner Cho, for instant, is a Simile - ""a girl who was hurt in the darkness and ate what was given to her."" Only specially raised Ambassadors are able to communicate with the Ariekei. And it is this way - until one day an unexpected new Ambassador arrives. And everything goes to hell.""A world-destroying mistake. Not a stupid one: only the very worst luck.""
China Miéville once again does what he knows how to do best - gives the readers an amazingly vivid and weird bit of worldbuilding, creating the environment that is so alive and real despite - or maybe because of - its inherent strangeness. On this canvas he layers the story of war and destruction, the power struggle with the appeal and danger of politics, and brings in the colonizers vs. the colonized relationship perspective - from the weirdest angle imaginable. And it works, as usual, full of CM's captivating storytelling magic. It's all-immersing and impossible to put down. And in reaching into the depths of this story, taking in the message that is being spoken to me, I'm LIKE a girl who ate what was given to her. I'm NOT unlike a girl who ate. I AM a girl who ate what was given to her. (Hehe, that was fun! Misused, yes, but fun).""Before the humans came, we didn't speak so much of certain things. We were grown into Language. After history we made city and machines and gave them names. We didn't speak so much of certain things. Language spoke us. The words that wanted to be city and machines had us speak them so they could be.""The Language, albeit described in such a fascinating way, is only an excuse, a background, a way to make the reader reflect on the power dynamics and the attempts to reconcile the old and the new, the culture that is brought in and the culture that already exists. What is better - the purity of what is already established or the allure of the unknown that leads who knows where? How much stake can we put into championing what we think is right, what we think there should be? And speaking of championing what you think is right - I loved what was done with the character of Scile, the admirer of the way Ariekei lived their lives. He subverts the common trope of an outsider stepping into the world and realizing the power and rightness of the tradition of the 'natives' and championing it successfully. Scile's role gets turned on its head, he becomes a fanatic with a noble but unsustainable mission, and I love this turn of events. Because he is wrong and yet not entirely wrong.""It's not the Ambassadors' job to understand the Hosts,"" I said.""So whose is it?""""It's no one's job to understand them."" I think that was when I first really saw the gap between us.""There's not a correct answer to the above question, even in the light of Miéville's uncharacteristically optimistic ending (but in all honesty, once I read it again I realized how much hidden bittwersweetness it holds, and how much potential for badness there is even in this optimism).""I never, in Embassytown, the immer or the out, had the constitution for the intrigue. Floaking, I'd hoped, was a way around it. But politics finds you.""And a special applause goes to CM's protagonist, Avice Benner Cho. She is a very strong and brave character, and yet is rather calm, low-key, and even somewhat detached. She is self-sufficient and resourceful, level-headed and determined, and I love all of that. She has a very healthy attitude about life, and it's very refreshing to read the story in such a voice. She does what needs to be done, without whining, without needless deliberation, without any extra drama. After all, she is the girl who ate what was given to her. She is like... well, many things. And that is vitally important. --------------I loved this book immensely. It is the second sci-fi book revolving around language that I've read this year (The first was Delaney's Babel-17), and it spoke to me, referring to so many things that I care about. It was a great read, an amazing book from a favorite author, and yet another proof that China Miéville can succeed at writing about anything (c'mon, he already successfully wrote about space elevators after all!). 5 stars!""We speak now or I do, and others do. You've never spoken before. You will. You'll be able to say how the city is a pit and a hill and a standard and an animal that hunts and a vessel on the sea and the sea and how we are fish in it, not like the man who swims weekly with fish but the fish with which he swims, the water, the pool. I love you, you light me, warm me, you are suns.You have never spoken before.""
————————————March 2013: Having just reread this book with the Miévillians group here on Goodreads (http://www.goodreads.com/topic/group_...), I was thrilled that I loved this book even more the second time around. Thank you, my friends, for taking this Miéville linguistic space journey with me! This time, politics behind the events of Embassytown caught my attention much more than they did on the first read when I focused on Language most of the time. This book is definitely one of my favorites now.————————————March 2021: Buddy read with jade, Phil and Stephen. No matter how many times I reread it, it never loses even the tiniest bit of its magic.——————Recommended by: Catie";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9265453-embassytown
Brilliance;Marcus Sakey;2013;2010;444;3.98;32626;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Dystopia'];"In Wyoming, a little girl reads people’s darkest secrets by the way they fold their arms. In New York, a man sensing patterns in the stock market racks up $300 billion. In Chicago, a woman can go invisible by being where no one is looking. They’re called ""brilliants,"" and since 1980, one percent of people have been born this way. Nick Cooper is among them; a federal agent, Cooper has gifts rendering him exceptional at hunting terrorists. His latest target may be the most dangerous man alive, a brilliant drenched in blood and intent on provoking civil war. But to catch him, Cooper will have to violate everything he believes in - and betray his own kind.From Marcus Sakey, ""a modern master of suspense"" (Chicago Sun-Times) and ""one of our best storytellers"" (Michael Connelly), comes an adventure that’s at once breakneck thriller and shrewd social commentary; a gripping tale of a world fundamentally different and yet horrifyingly similar to our own, where being born gifted can be a terrible curse.";Brilliance can be a curse when the dirty mudbloods are envious.People with special talents, government conspiracy, moral philosophy, ethics, the usual thriller stuff, but it´s especially amazing for readers like me with one important requirement: Not having read all the amazing comic universes out there. Still to come, I am so looking forward too, but not feeling ready, especially regarding being able to fully enjoy the English originals. For others, especially the US and UK fraction, who grew up or are growing up with comics all around them, this might certainly feel like a combination of some classic talents to build an own universe. But if one doesn´t know it, it´s incredible, one doesn´t get this stuff with average Sci-Fi or fantasy that is more focused on worldbuilding, it has a style and taste of its own and it opened one more question. What will come, what new comic superhero fantasy sci-fi horror books and graphic novels are still out there screaming to be created?Especially today, where there is the full potential for crossover hybrids with everyone having access to all works and, much more important, to the creative writing lectures for all three kinds of main über genres: character driven, plot driven, and, the best and most difficult one, the chimeras mixing it without a second of infodump, not dialogued or actioned exposition, and a flow so strong it eats away weeks of life with one bite. Looking at you, Brandon Sanderson, you genius.I like plot focused technothrillers with hard cuts, cliffhangers, and many open questions and special talents and don´t really care much about character´s credibility, logic, or emotional excesses. That´s also why I am the wrong person to rate the, with a look at the reviews, criticism of the protagonists quality and fast, action writing style, I´m a too easy going and to satisfy dude for that. I deem it a bit unfair too, because in certain genres, world and plot come before characterization and I don´t read stuff with, boring, just people idiot driveling, feeling, and stuff. Tastes differ and I don´t get people poaching in genres they don´t prefer. I mean, they get it with food, why not with art, it´s mysterious.The series gets better and better with each part, give it a try, even if you are in the mentioned comic knowledge pro group and could be thinking more about when you saw what in which series instead of enjoying the new adaption.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_...;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17171909-brilliance
The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.;Neal Stephenson;2017;2010;752;3.86;32616;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Historical Fiction', 'Magic'];"From bestselling author Neal Stephenson and critically acclaimed historical and contemporary commercial novelist Nicole Galland comes a captivating and complex near-future thriller combining history, science, magic, mystery, intrigue, and adventure that questions the very foundations of the modern world.When Melisande Stokes, an expert in linguistics and languages, accidently meets military intelligence operator Tristan Lyons in a hallway at Harvard University, it is the beginning of a chain of events that will alter their lives and human history itself. The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: she must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money.Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London’s Crystal Palace—the world’s fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world ""jams"" the ""frequencies"" used by magic, and it’s up to Tristan to find out why.And so the Department of Diachronic Operations—D.O.D.O. —gets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back, and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive . . . and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial—and treacherous—nature of the human heart.Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson’s work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland’s storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible, and take you to places—and times—beyond imagining.";We seem to be living in a period in which time travel has captured a considerable portion of the public’s attention, its attention for entertainment at least. There are several TV series on at present (that I know of) that deal in temporal backs and forths, (I really loved Flash Forward several years back) and there seem to have been few extended periods in which the form was absent from the airwaves (and wires). It has long been an attractive concept for feature films. My personal favorites are Time Bandits and Interstellar. Instead of loading up this review with a vast list of time-travel related works. I refer you to this wonderful Wiki entry, if you can find the time.  Rod Taylor in a nifty film version of HG’s classic tale - looks a bit like it was intended to traverse the everglades Occasionally time jumps are used to illuminate political views about the chronological base point for those stories, what the future might look like if this or that keeps on. The Time Machine by H.G. Wells pops to mind for that. Another notion takes a more optimistic view. What might a utopian future look like? Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward fills that bill, although Bellamy uses the cheap device of the imagined future being visited via dream. Samuel Clemens had a go in a less political vein with A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court. The time travel yarn has been around for a long time. Nicole Galland - from her site The latest entry into this long-favored class, The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O., offers one of the most delicious concepts I have ever encountered in a time travel book, hell, in any sort of book, merging hard science fiction with witchcraft. Melisande Stokes is stuck in London in 1851. Thankfully she has left her journal in a safe-deposit box, in a bank she knows will persist into the 21st century, which is a good thing. Stokes is in serious danger of being stuck in that time permanently. (zero bars) Having been transported to this past by a combination of technology and magic, she is running up against a deadline. July 2, 1851 is when magic vanished from the earth, (or in her immediate case, will vanish) and getting back to her own time without it is just not gonna happen. Tick tock. Melisande was an adjunct prof at Harvard’s Department of Ancient and Classical Languages (or will be. I get so confused.) when she literally bumped into Tristan Lyons, a military intelligence guy with a shadowy government agency. Meet cute. Turns out he has a special need for her particular skill set. And so the journey begins. It appears that diverse ancient and not so ancient cultures wrote about the existence of magic, (Trust me, this is not a spoiler.) and Lyons needs someone to translate these rare and fragile materials. Mel and Tristan’s early time together is an adorable sequence, entailing living small, lots of late nights in limited space, and too much takeout Chinese. (presumably, there being no takeout Sumerian nearby) So, what happened to magic? Where did it go? One of the mysteries in the book is why magic vanished when it did. Neal Stephenson - from his site - Stephenson insists that the Children of the Corn are not his Another key player is soon brought in. Doctor Frank Oda (There is no try, only invent?) who has had way too much fun with Schrodinger’s cat, and now has a chance to scale up and make some practical use of his theories, like creating a space in which one might be able to cast a spell or two. And if you intend to do some magic you might need a specialist. Voila! Enter a crone of a witch, sent to the project several lifetimes ago by a time-travelling Melisande. Still with us? The first third of the book is pretty much pure delight, as we follow Melisande, Tristan, Oda, the now-transformed (hubba-hubba) witch and a few others as they figure out what needs figuring and begin to practice actual time travel. In addition to the above named, there is an Irish witch in the Elizabethan era who adds her commentary and reporting of events in the form of letters to her leader. These are delicious.  Marty McFly’s sweet ride Ok, this was HUGE fun to read, as the initial group forms, and takes on the challenges of transforming the theoretical into the possible. Dare we say it’s magical? There is a running joke for about 150 pps, as Melisande offers guesses as to what D.O.D.O. might actually stand for, (Department of Diabolical Obscurantism?) but the truth is eventually revealed and the joke dropped. So where does D.O.D.O.’s charm begin to wear thin? As the tech becomes reliable, the government sponsoring agency grows, and what had seemed an entrepreneurial startup, in feel, if not actuality, morphs into a lumbering bureaucracy, led, predictably, by buffoons. As happens when governments and contractors are presented with a new toy, how to weaponize it is brought in for some consideration. It is at this point that the form of the novel takes a turn. I expect it was intended as a satirical look at how the heavy hand of institutionalization does its best to stamp out creativity. Instead of more flowing, longer passages of story-telling, we are treated to a blizzard of (Rumsfeldian snowflakes?) small exchanges, back and forths among the primary and too many secondary characters. There are internal memos about far too many things. Occasionally they poke through the surface crust and offer up a yuck or two, but mostly serve to slow everything down. I kept on for the entirety, 742 pps in my ARE. But it sometimes became a chore. An epic Viking poem about a raid on a Walmart sounds like a funny idea, but was painful to get through. The best humor is that based on the characters. I thought the resident Hungarian witch, Erszebet Karpathy, (please, oh please, can Christina Hendricks play her if there is to be a movie?) was hilarious in her diva mode. There is an Irish witch who offers both danger and fun, and a nice bit of inside cynicism on Shakespeare. (Galland has considerable Shakespearean expertise, so we can guess who wrote most of this.)   From the TV show Timeless - looking ready to munch some ghosts There are other sections that are pretty entertaining. Some elements of time travel make for interesting circumstances on the landing end. Stephenson (it really has to be him) takes adolescent delight in concocting joke names out of government acronyms. You don’t have to have the mind of a 12-year-old boy to enjoy these, but it helps. Others will get to exercise the muscles that make one’s eyes roll. (I flipped back and forth between these modes) Monty Python is referenced with some frequency, particularly when the witch is being put through her paces. I quite enjoyed those, Python fan that I am, but there were probably too many references to newts. (It gets better) The chapter sub-headings are in a 19th century style that was adorable: Diachronicle (Mel’s diary) Days 57-221 (Winter, Year 0) - In which Tristan determines to fix magic or Diachronicle Day 323 - In which we learn quite rudely that nothing is ever simple. I don’t want to give up too many details, but there are, as in most (all?) organizations, battles for power, intrigue, subterfuge, back-stabbing, sucking up (The Office, witchy time-travel edition) and all sorts of unpleasantness. Multiple places in time become relevant as both strategic advantages, and as opportunities for office intrigue, and the cast of characters keeps growing. One of the notions incorporated here is a relationship over the centuries with a family run bank, The Fuggers. (not to be confused with the 1960s band, The Fugs, or the leadership of most major banking institutions of today, which would be pronounced slightly differently.) Yes, there was and is a real Fugger bank dynasty. It originated in the 14th century and is still a going concern. It will definitely make your Spidey senses tingle if you are into concerning yourself about the illuminati and global conspiracies. Neal Stephenson is second to none when it comes to generating techno-babble, a skill born of the magical combination of his almost supernatural creativity, and his considerable technical expertise. He knows where the bull leaves off and the droppings begin and is gifted at disguising the lines between. (These aren’t the droppings you are looking for) In explaining how the techno-magic works he tosses in a bit of what sounds to my ears (looks to my eyes?) like a Salem version of string theory. But no matter. If you don’t have time for this sort of thing, there is no need to get stuck there. You can just jump over it. I have not previously read any work by co-author Nicole Galland, so musty rely on external sources for a notion. Her profile on GR fills that bill nicely. She has much experience in theater and is particularly knowledgeable about The Bard, which comes in handy here. She and Stephenson were among the co-authors of a cooperative writing project, The Mongoliad Trilogy. I will leave you to wander the internet for descriptions of Neal Stephenson. If you do not already know about him, quick, hurry, catch up. So,  The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.  is a mish-mosh, both wonderful and tedious, engaging and fun and tedious, jejune, but sometimes hilarious, fascinating, but sometimes making you want to scan pages. I really have no intel on which of the authors wrote what parts, or if the work was even divided that way. I suppose interviews closer to the publication date might offer more on that, who to blame for this and applaud for that. The book offers a smart look at the details of what concrete challenges might be presented were time travel a possibility, and a harsh look at the persistence of human foolishness through the ages. With not a tachyon in sight. But the concept. OMG, the concept is bloody magnificent! This book is worth reading for that alone. There is enough fun in here to keep you reading. There is enough adventure to keep you wondering what will happen next, and there are enough characters that you are likely to find some whose fate you care about. And if you do, you will be heartened to know that the ending holds what seems a promise that there will be a sequel, assuming, of course, that you can set a spell and make some time.

I'm not going to believe that the two main characters are falling in love just because the author tells me they are. The male MC is a total Mary Sue too. He received his doctorate in biochem on the same day as he got one in medicine. He can analyze people better than a psychiatrist.

Only Human;Sylvain Neuvel;2018;2010;336;3.63;32134;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fiction', 'Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Aliens', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];In her childhood, Rose Franklin accidentally discovered a giant metal hand buried beneath the ground outside Deadwood, South Dakota. As an adult, Dr. Rose Franklin led the team that uncovered the rest of the body parts which together form Themis: a powerful robot of mysterious alien origin. She, along with linguist Vincent, pilot Kara, and the unnamed Interviewer, protected the Earth from geopolitical conflict and alien invasion alike. Now, after nearly ten years on another world, Rose returns to find her old alliances forfeit and the planet in shambles. And she must pick up the pieces of the Earth Defense Corps as her own friends turn against each other.;"It’s ironic, in a really sad way. There’s more closeness here, more love and acceptance, than anywhere else. White, black, brown, Christian, Muslim, all brought together by the greatest injustice of all.
4 1/2 stars. This has been such a fantastic series. I think Waking Gods will forever be my favourite, but there's many great things I can say about this final installment.While I felt the action was slightly toned down here (though still plenty of thrills), Only Human makes up for it with its timely social commentary. Picking up nine years after the events of the previous book, we learn of the impact the giant alien robots have had on the world. Fear, paranoia and wilful ignorance rule our planet as anyone who is considered ""different"" is placed into work camps, or murdered.
“We’re talking about human beings making a conscious effort…to be ignorant. Willfully stupid. They’re proud of it. They take pride in idiocy. There’s not even an attempt to rationalize things anymore….Our entire race is trying to lobotomize itself.”
The interview transcripts and diary entries lead the story once again. Along with some thrilling action and fascinating science, this keeps the book zipping along at a breakneck pace. I was turning the pages like crazy, my eyes darting from one paragraph to the next in my desperate need to discover how it all ends.Only Human is packed full of goods. It's fast-paced action, thematically dark and sad, but with plenty of darkly comic parts and lots of Vincent being a lovable goofball. Race and racism are explored, as is Islamophobia. I also really enjoyed the discussions on patriotism and nationalism, especially how “love” for one’s country is challenged. Is it love? Neuvel ponders. Or is it pride?The novel's weakest point was, for me, Katherine Lebedev. She feels like a caricature - a strange, campy individual who is overly theatrical and unbelievable. While many of Neuvel's characters seem to have somewhat jaunty voices, Katherine felt too much. It was hard to convince myself she could be a real person.But my complaints are minor. Only Human was an extremely enjoyable reading experience and a near-perfect conclusion to one of my favourite series of recent years.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35820656-only-human
Machines like Me;Ian McEwan;2019;2010;306;3.59;32003;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Speculative Fiction', 'British Literature'];Britain has lost the Falklands war, Margaret Thatcher battles Tony Benn for power and Alan Turing achieves a breakthrough in artificial intelligence. In a world not quite like this one, two lovers will be tested beyond their understanding.Machines Like Me occurs in an alternative 1980s London. Charlie, drifting through life and dodging full-time employment, is in love with Miranda, a bright student who lives with a terrible secret. When Charlie comes into money, he buys Adam, one of the first batch of synthetic humans. With Miranda’s assistance, he co-designs Adam’s personality. This near-perfect human is beautiful, strong and clever – a love triangle soon forms. These three beings will confront a profound moral dilemma. Ian McEwan’s subversive and entertaining new novel poses fundamental questions: what makes us human? Our outward deeds or our inner lives? Could a machine understand the human heart? This provocative and thrilling tale warns of the power to invent things beyond our control.;"Three days before, she had asked a mysterious question. We were mid-embrace, in the conventional position. She drew my face towards hers. Her look was serious. She whispered, ""Tell me something. Are you real?"" I didn’t reply.
A few days ago, my sister introduced me to the bizarre world of soap cutting on Instagram. For some reason I have been unable to fathom, we spent an unreasonable amount of time being mesmerized by these videos. ""What are we doing?"" I wondered, as I clicked to the next one. At one point I laughed and said aloud: ""When the aliens arrive and study us, they'll decide we're out of our minds based on things like this.""Because humans are not particularly rational beings. Sure, we have certain capabilities that make us more able to rationalize than other animals, but we are deeply motivated by irrational emotions and impulses. We want things that are bad for us. We contradict ourselves. We love. Rationality has no place in the human heart.In Machines Like Me, this becomes the core dilemma: what happens when a humanoid artificial intelligence, built on logic, rationality and absolutes, lives among completely irrational, impulsive, contradictory humans? What does a logical machine do when faced with illogical problems like:
Millions dying of diseases we know how to cure. Millions living in poverty when there’s enough to go around. We degrade the biosphere when we know it’s our only home. We threaten each other with nuclear weapons when we know where it could lead. We love living things but we permit a mass extinction of species.
This aspect, like a few other aspects of the book, is interesting. McEwan has once more written a character-driven exploration of a people and culture. The problem is - and this does seem to be something McEwan indulges in often - the extensive amount of waffling and seemingly extraneous information. I still feel unconvinced about the decision to set this book in an alternate Thatcher-era Britain. I cannot wrap my mind around why this seemed like a good choice, as opposed to our current time. It was almost gimmicky. In this alternate 1980s, Alan Turing is still very much alive and leading the developments in artificial intelligence, Thatcher is fighting a losing battle in the Falklands War, and Tony Benn is the leader of the opposition. Why any of this is the case remains a bit of a mystery to me.In this world, citizens who can afford the hefty price tag can purchase an Adam or Eve, specify certain characteristics, and live with their very own humanoid robot. Charlie Friend does just that, bringing Adam into his home and introducing him to his younger girlfriend, Miranda. It doesn't take Adam long to fall in love with Miranda, have a brief physical affair with her, disable his shutdown switch, and then proceed to compose thousands of haiku for his beloved.These are minor details in the exploration of the interactions between the characters. Some of the ethics of technology issues are fascinating, though hardly groundbreaking, but the book is at its strongest when looking at the clash of the rationality of machines with the irrational subjectivity of human nature. At times, it can be hard to know who is the human - Adam or Charlie - but Adam's inability to deviate from certain precepts is the ultimate tell.But other parts are far less interesting, going into seemingly superfluous detail. The subplot of the secrets from Miranda's past, the couples' endeavours to adopt a young boy, the explanation of the P versus NP problem, and the eye-glazing textbook descriptions of the fictional history and technology in this world seem to add pages to the book, but little else. I am not sure why McEwan decided to turn this speculative piece on artificial intelligence into a critique of the political landscape of 1980s Britain. The interactions between human and machine were compelling, but the sweeping overviews of years of fictional history were far less so.Warning for graphic sexual violence.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42086795-machines-like-me
The Book of Strange New Things;Michel Faber;2014;2010;500;3.66;31913;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Religion', 'Literary Fiction', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Audiobook'];"A monumental, genre-defying novel over ten years in the making, Michel Faber's The Book of Strange New Things is a masterwork from a writer in full command of his many talents.It begins with Peter, a devoted man of faith, as he is called to the mission of a lifetime, one that takes him galaxies away from his wife, Bea. Peter becomes immersed in the mysteries of an astonishing new environment, overseen by an enigmatic corporation known only as USIC. His work introduces him to a seemingly friendly native population struggling with a dangerous illness and hungry for Peter's teachings—his Bible is their ""book of strange new things."" But Peter is rattled when Bea's letters from home become increasingly desperate: typhoons and earthquakes are devastating whole countries, and governments are crumbling. Bea's faith, once the guiding light of their lives, begins to falter. Suddenly, a separation measured by an otherworldly distance, and defined both by one newly discovered world and another in a state of collapse, is threatened by an ever-widening gulf that is much less quantifiable. While Peter is reconciling the needs of his congregation with the desires of his strange employer, Bea is struggling for survival. Their trials lay bare a profound meditation on faith, love tested beyond endurance, and our responsibility to those closest to us. Marked by the same bravura storytelling and precise language that made The Crimson Petal and the White such an international success, The Book of Strange New Things is extraordinary, mesmerizing, and replete with emotional complexity and genuine pathos.";"Sometime in the future, humanity has discovered they are not alone in the universe: on a distant planet named Oasis dwells a race of supremely ugly aliens (their faces are described as two foetuses fused together!) - and they LOVE Jeebus. So much so that they’re withholding food from the handful of human colonists on their planet until they get a replacement missionary. Enter Peter Leigh, a former homeless junkie thief turned born-again Christian minister selected by the USIC Corporation to be sent to Oasis and preach from the Bible, which the Oasans refer to as The Book of Strange New Things. But why are the Oasans so enamoured with Christianity? And what happened to their last minister…? That’s the setup for Michel Faber’s latest doorstopper-sized novel, and it’s actually quite enticing and original-seeming at first. Except that summary is misleading because this book is actually about how long distance relationships don’t work. I know – pick your jaw up off the floor because that’s revelatory information, right? But that is essentially the whole book which wouldn’t be so bad if I cared a bit about either Peter or his wife Bea but I didn’t. Peter heads to Oasis while Bea remains on Earth. Things go well for Peter – the Oasans are receptive and he enjoys his time on the planet; things for badly for Bea as the world around her falls apart – China invades the Middle East and ends up controlling their oil supply, global supermarket chains go bankrupt, freak weather decimates countries, wars erupt, governments topple, it’s the complete and total collapse of Western civilisation. Make no mistake though: The Book of Strange New Things is an utterly tedious read. Beyond the novelty of meeting the Oasans, there’s nothing much to them. They’re around five feet tall, they’re ugly, they’re a very simple, agrarian-based culture, and many of them believe the word of God completely. Little is added to this knowledge as the novel progresses. The only “conflict” Peter encounters is trying to make the Bible stories work for his new flock as they have trouble pronouncing “s” and “t” in their tongue as well as understanding some of the imagery (they don’t have sheep or fish so wouldn’t know what stories involving them would mean), so he rewrites them to make it easier for them to speak and grasp. He doesn’t have to try to convert them as a large number are already devout Christians and he doesn’t encounter the ones who aren’t. Easier and easier. He gets on with his fellow humans on the USIC base for the most part. They’re a gentle but soulless bunch consumed with work – they are the best in the professions: engineering, geology, biology, medicine, etc. A giant (read: “evil”) corporation behind this space endeavour? Never seen that in a sci-fi alien story! The only thing missing was the meat-head soldier archetype but there are no weapons or fighting in the book so they’re absent. Wondering where the drama/story here is? There isn’t any! Maybe you’re thinking Oasis is some wonderful vista paradise like Pandora in Avatar? Think again! It’s a completely flat landscape with no discernible features. The Oasans are completely isolated besides some weird duck creatures who appear a couple times (so how did they evolve exactly?), their simple huts, and their fields of whiteflower which they grow to trade for medicine with the humans. I don’t need the landscape to be extraordinary I just wish Faber would give me something, anything, than nothing! This is barely genre writing. Because it’s set on an alien planet doesn’t make it sci-fi, or at least it’s not a good representation of that genre’s heights (despite the way some readers look down upon sci-fi as a “lesser” genre). Good sci-fi is imaginative – The Book of Strange Things is not. Peter’s wife Bea, though extremely whiny and annoying, tells Peter and the reader through her emails (sent via the Shoot – why did they rename a computer, a Shoot? What was wrong with “computer”?) of troubles on Earth, which I mentioned earlier. These emails are the only real conflict in the book by the way.It seems that her story would’ve been much more interesting to read than Peter’s. Instead we’re subjected to the most monotonous non-story ever: Peter telling the Oasans some Bible stories. Peter helping them harvest the whiteflower crop. Peter trying to learn their language. Peter having trouble sleeping and looking at the stars. Peter walking across a flat landscape drinking melon-flavoured water. Peter staring blankly at nothing. This book is nearly 600 pages long!! Cut out the tedious crap and you’ll have a mediocre 100-150 page novel instead of an awful 600 page one. And speaking of Bea’s increasingly difficult life on doomed Earth, USIC do their best to censor their off-world staff from news of Earth’s collapse by ripping out pages of magazines/newspapers arriving at the base - but they don’t censor Bea’s emails even though they have the capability to do so? Her emails contain the most damning information! I will say that Faber’s prose is for the most part clear and accessible. He may not be able to tell a tight, fast-moving story anymore, but he can still write quite well. And I did like some scenes in the book, particularly with the former minister who went native, and Grainger, the USIC pharmacist, as she fell apart on Oasis. I had her and Peter pegged to have a rushed, embarrassing affair though Faber thankfully steered clear of that – though he did everything he could to hint at its possibility!And I liked how many of the USIC characters were named after Marvel Comics writers from the Silver Age, in particular Jakob Kurtzberg, the missing former minister, who mirrors the real name of Jack Kirby (technically a Golden Age creator). Who was Jack Kirby, non-comics reader? Creator of much of the Marvel Universe: Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Fantastic Four and the X-Men to name a few - and a preacher of a kind himself who lived in the stars! Faber’s look at Christianity is just not insightful. What do we learn? That Bea converted Peter when he was a troubled criminal. He bought into the religion and became a personable minister. Away from his wife, her troubles overwhelm her and she loses her faith. And? Also, how easy is it to write a devout Christian character? “Jesus saves. God has a plan for everything. Trust in the Bible and our Lord – he shall provide” etc. This isn’t great writing or characterisation.The Christian overtones to the story were too on the nose and weren’t enough to redeem it. The book has 28 chapters like the Gospel of Matthew (which is repeatedly referenced), Peter is bitten by an animal, seeming to die (in the eyes of the Oasans) and return a la Christ after the crucifixion (not really but to the Oasans perhaps), the walking through the wilderness with Grainger (temptation). Does Peter become like Christ to them? Is this how Christ was to us – an alien? Is this how religions start? Maybe some people will be blown away by these aspects of the book but I could not care less – I was beaten into apathy at this point by the slug-like pacing. As there’s no real story the book doesn’t build to a big finish, or any kind of finish at all really, and simply ends. It couldn’t be more dissatisfying or anticlimactic. Faber’s Strange New Things is a deeply unimaginative novel. The sci-fi element is poorly conceived and uninteresting – Oasis and the Oasans could not be more dull. The book drags on for hundreds of pages without a plot, with barely any character development, and with hardly a thing happening to break up the boredom. The whole “Earth’s collapse” felt forced, done because Bea’s life needed to get worse so that she and Peter could fight via email, not because it was convincing on any level. I mean, China invading the Middle East – what?! I’ve enjoyed Faber’s work over the years from Under the Skin to The Fire Gospel to his short stories in Some Rain Must Fall, but The Book of Strange New Things is gimmicky and horribly boring. It’s far too long with much too little substance. Arguably this is his worst novel – I can see why he’s saying he’s giving up on writing any more of them seeing how uninspired this one turned out! Unlike the Oasans and the Bible, most people will have more than enough of this book long before its end. It was a real struggle to get there and not really worth it. (Side note: there’s some question among some reviewers as to why the Oasans would so readily accept Christianity though Faber does explain this in the book. Here’s why, and it’s actually one of the few parts of the novel I liked:If humans are cut, the wound stops bleeding, scabs over, the platelets in our blood do their work, maybe some pus follows, but we soon heal. If an Oasan is cut, and the cut becomes infected, they die. Their bodies are completely defenceless. Christianity preaches healing and rebirth. The Oasans are a race who cannot heal naturally and take everything literally so they would embrace Christianity’s message of healing as a solution to their plight.)";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20697435-the-book-of-strange-new-things
Foe;Iain Reid;2018;2010;261;3.71;31550;no;['Horror', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Mystery Thriller'];A taut, psychological mind-bender from the bestselling author of I’m Thinking of Ending Things.We don’t get visitors. Not out here. We never have.In Iain Reid’s second haunting, philosophical puzzle of a novel, set in the near-future, Junior and Henrietta live a comfortable, solitary life on their farm, far from the city lights, but in close quarters with each other. One day, a stranger from the city arrives with alarming Junior has been randomly selected to travel far away from the farm...very far away. The most unusual part? Arrangements have already been made so that when he leaves, Henrietta won't have a chance to miss him, because she won't be left alone—not even for a moment. Henrietta will have company. Familiar company.Told in Reid’s sharp and evocative style, Foe examines the nature of domestic relationships, self-determination, and what it means to be (or not to be) a person. An eerily entrancing page-turner, it churns with unease and suspense from the first words to its shocking finale.;This book should be getting soooo much more attention.It's not so much the story itself that is the draw (although it's a fantastic plot), it's the execution that sets this book apart. This story is so subtle with its ever-growing sinister tension. It's more uncomfortable and nail biting than any thriller I've read in years. The use of quotation marks. I know, I know that sounds weird if you've not read the book but believe me when I say it's genius. Short chapters. I mean reallyyyy short chapters keep the story propulsing forward at a breakneck speed. This is a one sitting read no matter how slow of a reader picks it up. There's simply no putting this book down. Nothing is as it seems and just when you think you've got your head securely wrapped around it all, your head falls off and rolls out the front door.Absolutely a re-read type of book just to catch and relish in the hints you missed the first time around.The ending. Fuck fuck fuck the ending is SUBLIME!Somebody needs to make this into a movie. No, I take that back. Christopher Nolan needs to make this into a movie. Somebody make that happen. Thanks.Fucking brilliant. That's all I've got.P.S. don't go running off and reading the reviews (except mine of course) because people suck.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37510662-foe
The Fold;Peter Clines;2015;2010;384;3.88;31420;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Fantasy'];STEP INTO THE FOLD. IT’S PERFECTLY SAFE.  The folks in Mike Erikson's small New England town would say he's just your average, everyday guy. And that's exactly how Mike likes it. Sure, the life he's chosen isn’t much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he’s content with his quiet and peaceful existence.   That is, until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve: far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to “fold” dimensions, it shrinks distances so that a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. The invention promises to make mankind’s dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the Door is completely safe.  Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn’t quite what it seems—and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret.  As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there’s only one answer that makes sense. And if he’s right, it may only be a matter of time before the project destroys…everything.  A cunningly inventive mystery featuring a hero worthy of Sherlock Holmes and a terrifying final twist you’ll never see coming, The Fold is that rarest of things: a genuinely page-turning science-fiction thriller. Step inside its pages and learn why author Peter Clines has already won legions of loyal fans.;The first 260 pages of this book are easily 4.5/5 stars. The last 100...are not. Maybe 3.5 stars in the end?Must ponder further and fight the disappointment that is all the more crushing because the first 2/3 of this book was so brilliant.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23164927-the-fold
Terms of Enlistment;Marko Kloos;2013;2010;345;4.05;31336;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Military Science Fiction', 'War'];The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.;"Well, while I made it past the point where my reading pal (my husband) quit Terms of Enlistment (36% on Kindle, compared to his 24%), I'm also giving up the ghost on this book. Terms of Enlistment isn't a terrible book. Which is, in and of itself, a sticking point. If it were a better book, or if it were a more hilariously bad book, I'd probably be more inclined to stick with it. But it's not good enough to keep my interest and it's not bad enough to trigger my train-wreck syndrome. What it is, is a pretty bog-standard Military SF book, without enough world-building, characterization or plain old charisma to motivate me to keep going. With some weird Othering of women and Blacks thrown in for lagniappe. Marko Kloos is a capable writer. There's no phraseology here to make me swoon, but he communicates lucidly and with a good sense of visual/spatial dynamics, which is pretty crucial for SF in general and MilSF in particular. I never felt confused about what was going on. It's a minor nitpick that Kloos tends to use language very repetitively, using the exact same words/phrase to describe a thing over and over again, but not so much I wouldn't have kept reading if he had managed to capture my interest better. I was more thrown by his insistence of calling all the characters, collectively, either ""guys"" or ""girls"", which I could sort of handwave as a character trait, as his hero, Andrew Grayson, reminded me of a latter day Holden Caulfield, with all the socially stunted immaturity implied, but it still stuck out as weird and slightly unpleasant.I felt his greater failing was in creating—or really failing to create—Andrew Grayson as a fully realized character. I was reading a review for a different book where the reviewer commented that the traits of the main character were unremarkable taken individually, but didn't hold up when put together. I feel the same way about Andrew Grayson. Though Grayson grew up in a poor, inner city environment, the language of his POV (especially at the outset) is stilted, over-educated, lacking in slang and idiom, lacking that lived-in feeling to imply that Grayson's life didn't begin the same moment the story did. This is especially notable because, once Grayson enters the military, he noticeably does pick up a more consistently conversant and natural manner of expression.Similarly, though Grayson is apparently completely socially isolated and friendless in his civilian life (when leaving Boston—and though he's leaving both his parents behind—he states that he wouldn't feel a thing if Boston was obliterated in that moment; the only goodbyes he makes are to his parents & we are repeatedly told—even after he's in the military—how little he thinks about or cares about Boston), and though he comes across as the slightly sociopathic loner you might expect to show up at his school with an arsenal, once he gets into the military, Grayson has no awkwardness or problems making friends among his fellow recruits and effortlessly starts a romantic relationship with one of them; a relationship that—while, by necessity, very short in duration—lingers after they're separated by their post-Basic assignments and he reminisces and thinks about her in a way he thinks of no other person from his past, including his parents. Now, on the one hand, his father is described as your stereotypical abusive asshole, and, again, I can kind of hand wave his social/emotional disconnect as similarly stereotypical for an abused child…but then there would need to be a corresponding difficulty in making/maintaining relationships once he got into the military. But the complete social isolation and disconnect on one side of the equation and then a perfectly normal ability to socialize and form connections on the other, and the fact that Grayson is, in the military, actually a reasonably popular guy among his fellows does not hold up. The book also has problems with race and gender. For example, of the three drill sergeants in charge of Grayson's squad, the two White sergeants are brisk and no-nonsense, allowing no chance for hanky-panky, but the one Black sergeant is known to sleep soundly and through the night, allowing slack on his shift. When Grayson is out of training and assigned to his 'real' team, Jackson, the one Black teammate is the one who is standoffish and ""intimidating"", and he can form no connection with her as he does with his White teammates. Further, Black characters are always called out by race while (presumable) Latin@s are only called out by their surnames and we have (to where I quit) no known Asian representation or of any other ethnicity. I also think that some of this would be more excusable or understandable if Kloos had bothered to build up the characters to be anything more than Harris, the Black drill sergeant who sleeps, or Jackson, the intimidating Black teammate. Even with Andrew Grayson himself, there's not much there to grab onto. He has as much characterization as the avatar for a first person shooter video game…which is actually what much of this feels like. As I said to my husband, I know far more about Grayson's gun than I do about Grayson himself. Though he's formed this apparently deep connection with his fellow soldier…we don't even know her first name. Grayson always refers to her by her surname. Speaking of gender… My first impression was that Kloos actually does a good job of not being sexist; his military is co-ed and fairly evenly split. The women are not shown as being any less capable or more poorly performing than the men. Initially—in the first chapters regarding Basic Training—Kloos doesn't necessarily distinguish much between the men and women. But, as the story went on, just as Kloos felt the need to draw attention to which characters were Black at every opportunity, he seemed to feel the need to increasingly draw attention to which characters were women, and in the most annoying, patronizing of ways:
""…then Stratton is by my side, and he clocks the second Marine with a textbook jab right to the tip of the chin. To my left, two Marines try to tackle Hansen, whose ponytail bounces as she sidesteps one of them gracefully before kneeing the second Marine…""
It's never anything overtly offensive and any one instance probably wouldn't bother me, but it becomes a problem in aggregate and one that increases in frequency as time goes on.And, bottom line, there's nothing here of what Stephen King calls the gimme. We don't know enough about the world or its politics to give a crap about this story politically or to be excited by any new, cool, alien environments. We don't know enough about Grayson—and what we do know is (for me, at least) kind of repellant—to really care about what happens to him. We don't know anyone else in the story. And the military stuff isn't original or interesting enough to geek out over the cool tech or anything. When I was a younger reader, the excitement of just having a book to read was enough. Now that I'm older, more jaded, and have more disposable income to buy my own books, I find a book needs to work harder to give me a reason to keep going. Because there are always other books. This book has no reason.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800655-terms-of-enlistment

Hundreds of miles from ZaraCorp's headquarters on planet, 178 light-years from the corporation's headquarters on Earth, Jack is content as an independent contractor, prospecting and surveying at his own pace. As for his past, that's not up for discussion.Then, in the wake of an accidental cliff collapse, Jack discovers a seam of unimaginably valuable jewels, to which he manages to lay legal claim just as ZaraCorp is cancelling their contract with him for his part in causing the collapse.

Their entire legal right to exploit the verdant Earth-like planet, the basis of the wealth they derive from extracting its resources, is based on being able to certify to the authorities on Earth that Zarathustra is home to no sentient species.Then a small furry biped—trusting, appealing, and ridiculously cute—shows up at Jack's outback home. Followed by its family.

Thrawn: Alliances;Timothy Zahn;2018;2010;342;3.96;30763;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Novels'];"""I have sensed a disturbance in the Force.""Ominous words under any circumstances, but all the more so when uttered by Emperor Palpatine. On Batuu, at the edges of the Unknown Regions, a threat to the Empire is taking root—its existence little more than a glimmer, its consequences as yet unknowable. But it is troubling enough to the Imperial leader to warrant investigation by his most powerful agents: ruthless enforcer Lord Darth Vader and brilliant strategist Grand Admiral Thrawn. Fierce rivals for the emperor's favor, and outspoken adversaries on Imperial affairs—including the Death Star project—the formidable pair seem unlikely partners for such a crucial mission. But the Emperor knows it's not the first time Vader and Thrawn have joined forces. And there's more behind his royal command than either man suspects.In what seems like a lifetime ago, General Anakin Skywalker of the Galactic Republic, and Commander Mitth'raw'nuruodo, officer of the Chiss Ascendancy, crossed paths for the first time. One on a desperate personal quest, the other with motives unknown . . . and undisclosed. But facing a gauntlet of dangers on a far-flung world, they forged an uneasy alliance—neither remotely aware of what their futures held in store.Now, thrust together once more, they find themselves bound again for the planet where they once fought side by side. There they will be doubly challenged—by a test of their allegiance to the Empire . . . and an enemy that threatens even their combined might.";"A very good book and continuation of Thrawn's legend/legacy. If I am a little disappointed, it is because, as good as this book was, it is simply with Timothy Zahn writing Thrawn and Vader that I did not want good. I was expecting great. However, very good is very good.This book book is set in two time periods. Going back to the line in the first book where a meeting between, then General Anakin Skywalker and Thrawn, during the Clone Wars, was mentioned. The majority of this book takes place in that era, as well as the current problem. One thing I like very much in this book is Zahn's writing, the differences between Anakin and Vader, and how Vader refers to the memories of Anakin as ""the Jedi's."" Zahn also did a great job of showing the precognition powers the Force sensitive use. As the story progresses, I see the reason for this.The second era that this book is set in is right after Season 3 of Star Wars Rebels, right after Thrawn's biggest defeat to date. So his standing and loyalty are in question. There is a lot of verbal sparing and jockeying for the number 2 position in the Empire between Thrawn and Vader. Usually, with Thrawn coming out on top. However, there is a great deal of respect between the two telling points of that is Thrawn was still alive as Vader is not known for his patience. There are elements taken from other Star Wars pre-Disney era books. One of the ideas come from the Golden Age of the Sith comic series where a couple of Force sensitives found another way to earn a living out of their talents, and a material that has not been used in the Disney era as of yet, as well some more of the behind the scenes of Order 66.It is a very good book that is slightly slow in places. I think this was the only stumbling block for me as with Vader in the book, I was expecting a lot more action in the book. The lack of fights did show Vader's other skills that are sometimes forgotten because of his fearsome reputation and displays of power.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36385830-thrawn

No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't feel any of it.Howey's writing is good -- as always. He is definitely skilled with the written word. But the plot left me trolling other reviews for answers, for some glimmer of hope that I wasn't the only one struggling through this book.I think the biggest reason is the lack of a mythology. In Wool, Howey built an incredibly imaginative world that was easy to visualize, dropping hints as to the big question of ""Why?"" throughout the narrative. The world of Sand, however, just was. Maybe he plans to answer some questions -- where did the sand come from? what do the people know about their history? -- in future books.

Lost Stars;Claudia Gray;2015;2010;551;4.28;30064;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];The reign of the Galactic Empire has reached the Outer Rim planet of Jelucan, where aristocratic Thane Kyrell and rural villager Ciena Ree bond over their love of flying. Enrolling at the Imperial Academy together to become fighter pilots for the glorious Empire is nothing less than a dream come true for the both of them. But Thane sours on the dream when he sees firsthand the horrific tactics the Empire uses to maintain its ironclad rule.Bitter and disillusioned, Thane joins the fledgling Rebellion—putting Ciena in an unbearable position to choose between her loyalty to the Empire and her love for the man she's known since childhood.Now on opposite sides of the war, will these friends turned foes find a way to be together, or will duty tear them—and the galaxy—apart.;This is a great book. Very rarely do you get a book that manages to tick every box. This is a love story, but this is not a fluffy story. Both the characters are likeable, intelligent, and principled. In fact, all the characters are written very well, to the point that as a reader, I was invested in each character, even the side characters. The book has great character development, and the story is set across the whole original trilogy and finishes a year after Return of the Jedi.Usually in stories like this my biggest problem is the pace of the book, even this is done well, the book is off at a brisk pace Claudia Gray definitely know the right time to speed the story up and the time to slow it down at the correct times. Every time I finished a chapter, I would already want to read the next one and the next one.The book starts off on the planet Jelucan. This is on the outer rim. The Jelucan society is decided into two groups the kindred valley people who are the original or early settlers, and the Second Wavers, who tend to be the richer people who settled later. Of course, neither group gets on with the other. That is till young Ciena Ree of the village and Thane Kyrell of the wavers meet. Both have similar dreams and ambitions to join the Imperial Accademy. They are both different but compliment each other very well. As steel sharpens steel, what starts as a mutually beneficial friendily competitiveness, blossoms into something so much more.There are small thing in this book that make the book great, the show the Imperial propaganda machine in full effect, how people see the Empire as the law and order bringers, and how the Jedi and influential characters and scenes from the movies are seen though Imperial eyes. All the relationships and views are dynamic, continually moving, and interesting. This is a story done right in every way, I am sure even people who are not Star Wars fans will love this book.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25067046-lost-stars
Darth Plagueis;James Luceno;2012;2010;379;4.17;29879;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Novels'];“Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise that he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.”—Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the SithDarth Plagueis: one of the most brilliant Sith Lords who ever lived. Possessing power is all he desires. Losing it is the only thing he fears. As an apprentice, he embraces the ruthless ways of the Sith. And when the time is right, he destroys his Master--but vows never to suffer the same fate. For like no other disciple of the dark side, Darth Plagueis learns to command the ultimate power . . . over life and death.Darth Sidious: Plagueis’s chosen apprentice. Under the guidance of his Master, he secretly studies the ways of the Sith, while publicly rising to power in the galactic government, first as Senator, then as Chancellor, and eventually as Emperor.Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious, Master and acolyte, target the galaxy for domination--and the Jedi Order for annihilation. But can they defy the merciless Sith tradition? Or will the desire of one to rule supreme, and the dream of the other to live forever, sow the seeds of their destruction?;"Misleading, the Dark Side of the Force, is.
This is a novel (part of what is known nowadays as ""Legends"" in the Star Wars novel series, in other words, non-canonical anymore) featuring the events of the life of Darth Plagueis and his apprentice Darth Sidious.
DECEITFUL TITLE
Honestly, it was odd that the book was titled Darth Plagueis since while indeed the events begin with him as ""main character"", once Palpatine (eventually aka Darth Sidious) comes into the story, Plagueis got less and less relevant and Palpatine (Sidious) became the real protagonist of the novel.The novel lacks of action, and even in the few times that you have some action is told in such way that you don't feel any thrilled about it.I have to admit that there some interesting moments where you can appreciate how the financial resources of Hego Damask (Darth Plagueis) was crutial for several recognizable pieces of the Episodes' saga of Star Wars, such as the construction of Podracing track on Tatooine, the improvement of Kamino's cloning facilities, the dealings of the Trade Federation with Naboo and the political career of Palpatine in the Galactic Senate.However, some mysteries that I was eager to read about like the birth of Anakin Skywalker and the participation of Jedi Master Syfo-Dias in the ordering of the clone army, while they are indeed approached, much of them remain ambiguous without really offering anything new that one didn't know before of reading the book.
PALPATINE, JUST PALPATINE
I was kinda disappointed that Palpatine is named just that......""Palpatine""......with a poor explanation that he decided of not using his first name and keeping just his family name as his only name. Some other authors have been bold enough to invent names for elements like ""Coruscant"", ""Jaina Solo"", etc... and they became so widely known by fans that later has become ""canonical"" in the sense of being used in a movie of the saga. And taking in account that the author didn't invent ""Palpatine"" name, it was quite weak not trying to add some of value to the character's name.I understand that some talking with George Lucas, Lucasfilms' people, etc... was in the order to get approval for an ""official"" first name for Palpatine, but since this book covers even more the life of him than the very Hego Damask (Plagueis), I think that it was important to have that discussion and conceiving with a first name for Palpatine.
ALWAYS TWO, NO LESS, NO MORE...OR ISN'T IT?
One very odd thing was the Darth Plagueis said to Darth Tenebrous (his master) when he is killing him that the legacy of the ""Rule of Two"" from Darth Bane was dying with Tenebrous implying that Plagueis didn't believe wise to keep that rule. However, in like 30 years (if not more), he only took as apprentice to Darth Sidious... so when the heck was he going to ""break"" the rule of two?!!! Even Darh Sidious took as secret apprentice to Darth Maul covered with lies to Plagueis.And definitely, the decision of time chronology used in this book was unusual according with other novels of Star Wars, since while it tells several events unique to this book, there are many pages invested to tell events covered in other novels even movies.That wasn't bad per se, since that ""filled"" some ""holes"" in those previously told events, BUT also it was ""felt"" kinda some trick to stretch out long enough the book to reach a more desirable number of pages.I think that one of the coolest implications here, is that while you never a real interaction between Smee Skywalker (Anakin's mom) with Darth Plagueis......there is a casual mention that Palpatine (just Palpatine, please) was a really good podracer pilot on his young days......Mmmh.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11099729-darth-plagueis
Timebound;Rysa Walker;2012;2010;366;3.89;29771;yes;['Time Travel', 'Young Adult', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Romance'];When Kate Pierce-Keller’s grandmother gives her a strange blue medallion and speaks of time travel, sixteen-year-old Kate assumes the old woman is delusional. But it all becomes horrifyingly real when a murder in the past destroys the foundation of Kate’s present-day life. Suddenly, that medallion is the only thing protecting Kate from blinking out of existence.Kate learns that the 1893 killing is part of something much more sinister, and Kate’s genetic ability to time-travel makes her the only one who can stop him. Risking everything, she travels to the Chicago World’s Fair to try to prevent the killing and the chain of events that follows.Changing the timeline comes with a personal cost, however—if Kate succeeds, the boy she loves will have no memory of her existence. And regardless of her motives, does she have the right to manipulate the fate of the entire world?;“History is sacred—like a nature hike. ‘Leave only footprints, take only memories.”Rysa Walker’s Timebound (The Chronos Files #1) was a fun read. I liked the role of the future historian which is associated with time travel (even though I couldn’t get the image of STNG's Berlinghoff Rasmussen, a purported historian from the 26th century out of my head). I also liked the technology tied to diaries used by time travelers (which included the main character’s (Kate’s) grandmother who was stranded in 1969). Kate needs to use the diaries not only to figure out who killed her grandmother (and prevent this from happening), but also to stay alive herself. Much of the action took place at the World’s Fair (Columbian Exposition) in Chicago in 1893 and that added an interesting background to the story. 3.25 stars.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound
The Midnight Library;Matt Haig;2020;2020;288;3.99;1928764;no;['Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary', 'Magical Realism', 'Science Fiction', 'Adult'];Between life and death there is a library.When Nora Seed finds herself in the Midnight Library, she has a chance to make things right. Up until now, her life has been full of misery and regret. She feels she has let everyone down, including herself. But things are about to change.The books in the Midnight Library enable Nora to live as if she had done things differently. With the help of an old friend, she can now undo every one of her regrets as she tries to work out her perfect life. But things aren't always what she imagined they'd be, and soon her choices place the library and herself in extreme danger.Before time runs out, she must answer the ultimate question: what is the best way to live?;"I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.
 “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”
And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:
 “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”
Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:
 “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”
And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————

The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. 
 “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”
This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.
 “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”
In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.
“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”
And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.
 “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”
And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.


 “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”
And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. 
“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” 
2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————
“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too.——————Also posted on my blog.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578297-the-midnight-library
The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes;Suzanne Collins;2020;2020;541;3.96;838271;yes;['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance'];It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games. In the Capital, eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow is preparing for his one shot at glory as a mentor in the Games. The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate hanging on the slender chance that Coriolanus will be able to outcharm, outwit, and outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the winning tribute.The odds are against him. He's been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the female tribute from District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely intertwined -- every choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute... and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes.;"For all of their faults, The Hunger Games books a decade ago became a pop culture phenomenon. The brutal premise in a YA book, the surly heroine with a backbone of steel, the motifs of manipulation vs truth, the moral ambiguity, the pain of survival, the lasting impact of trauma — yeah,  I loved it shamelessly,  warts and all .And then Collins writes a prequel about President Snow. Yeah, *that* Snow. The Emperor Palpatine of that universe (I’m a bit shaky on Star Wars stuff, but I think I got that one right). The absolutely abhorrent embodiment of all evil, keen on sending children to death while oppressing the crap out of the country. So why?Is it a villain origin/redemption story? We do tend to like redemption of villains, the origin stories that explain the eventual slide into darkness. Darth Vader. Joker. Severus Snape. Wicked Witch of the West. So is this book here to show us the tragic slide into villainy, the horror of the circumstances and the Games that eats away at you and taints you until there is not much left? Or is this just a case of innate sociopathy, an early glimpse of the soul that thrives on cruelty? 
I think this book will alienate quite a few of Hunger Games fans. You see, it was easy to root for Katniss pitted against the ridiculous brutality of her world. She spoke to you, the girl who volunteered, the girl who defied her own self-preservation instinct to stand up for what’s right. But The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes makes it impossible to root for its protagonist because he is the ultimate antagonist, because we know what he will become. You don’t root for young Hitler to find love and success, after all.Coriolanus Snow cannot be redeemed. But he can be understood, to a point, and that’s what Collins did well here (or so my sleep-deprived brain after late night bleary-eyed reading believes). I like that Snow is not a born sociopath. He is bright but unlikeable, ambitious, resentful, conceited and very entitled, with capacity for manipulation and ruthlessness. He is slippery like the titular snakes. But he has some humanity in him - capacity for friendship, capacity for love, capacity to care and even a degree of sacrifice. The problem is the choices that he decides to make - the choices fueled by his over-developed self-preservation instinct which is by definition selfish. The problem is that you don’t need to be a born stone-cold tyrant — you can choose to become one when you choose yourself above all, when you make the corrupt system work for you instead of choosing to fight it. He chooses complicity — and that’s what shapes him into what he will become by the time 64 years later when Katniss Everdeen volunteers to become District 12 tribute in the horrific televised spectacle of Hunger Games.Snow decides to remain a predator so that he wouldn’t become prey. 
 “So he added a paragraph about his deep relief on winning the war, and the grim satisfaction of seeing the Capitol’s enemies, who’d treated him so cruelly, who’d cost his family so much, brought to their knees. Hobbled. Impotent. Unable to hurt him anymore. He’d loved the unfamiliar sense of safety that their defeat had brought. The security that could only come with power. The ability to control things. Yes, that was what he’d loved best of all.”
 
This is a story of the formation of a tyrant - but the one who understands what makes others rebel, and that, as we know, makes him even more dangerous. No surprise he is behind the whole concept of Hunger Games as a mandatory sickening voyeristic pageantry spectacle.
 “We control it,” he said quietly. “If the war’s impossible to end, then we have to control it indefinitely. Just as we do now. With the Peacekeepers occupying the districts, with strict laws, and with reminders of who’s in charge, like the Hunger Games. In any scenario, it’s preferable to have the upper hand, to be the victor rather than the defeated.”
It’s not a love story, despite the superficial resemblance to it. Snow wants Lucy, wants to possess her, wants her to be his — and wants it only as far as it suits his comfort. Don’t think that it ends up being a desperate turn to villainy after the loss of a loved one — that would be too cheap.
 “His girl. His. Here in the Capitol, it was a given that Lucy Gray belonged to him, as if she’d had no life before her name was called out at the reaping. Even that sanctimonious Sejanus believed she was something he could trade for. If that wasn’t ownership, what was? With her song, Lucy Gray had repudiated all that by featuring a life that had nothing to do with him, and a great deal to do with someone else. Someone she referred to as “lover,” no less. And while he had no claim on her heart — he barely knew the girl! — he didn’t like the idea of anyone else having it either. Although the song had been a clear success, he felt somehow betrayed by it. Even humiliated.”
No, there is no redemption for Coriolanus Snow. There is only understanding which at least for me led to even more repulsion. Because he saw a path that Katniss eventually took — and instead forged his own, the easier one, the one of cruel overcompensation for almost not taking it.——————Yes, I can see how it will alienate some long-standing fans. But I am glad I read it. Even if I couldn’t root for anyone.Now I can reread The Hunger Games trilogy with new eyes, understanding the underpinnings of that horror show better.3.5 stars.
“He knew this would be easier if he wasn’t such an exceptional person. The best and the brightest humanity had to offer.”

Project Hail Mary;Andy Weir;2021;2020;476;4.51;639412;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Space', 'Thriller', 'Adult'];Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission—and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he’s got to do it all alone.Or does he?;"“I’d have to do the math to know for sure but — I can’t help it, I want to do the math right now.”
This book is half science experiments, half wacky buddy comedy — and it just works so so so well! That nerdy glee I felt on every page of The Martian is back full force. By golly*, I am so gosh-darn* happy right now. Geez and fudge and Holy Moly!*. (Yeah, this book’s protagonist tends to sound like he’s 85 — he’s just not a foul-mouthed sort of a scientist): * 

“The whole world put you in charge of solving this problem, and you came directly to a junior high school science teacher?”“Yes.”
In The Martian, Mark Watney woke up with an antenna sticking out of his chest and realized he had to science the shit out of it if he wanted to survive on Mars. In Project Hail Mary, Ryland Grace wakes up from a coma with a bunch of tubes sticking out of him (including that spot where the sun don’t shine) and realizes that he has no memory of what happened — and eventually, through a bit of complicated science, realizes and remembers that he’s the sole survivor of a mission that’s the last ditch chance to save Earth from a star-eating microbe (“Evolution can be insanely effective when you leave it alone for a few billion years.”). For life that needs the output of the Sun it’s not good news. And yes, he also will need to science the shit out of it.
“How did you do it? What killed it?”“I penetrated the outer cell membrane with a nanosyringe.”“You poked it with a stick?”“No!” I said. “Well. Yes. But it was a scientific poke with a very scientific stick.”
It’s obvious how wonderfully nerdy Andy Weir is. It’s obvious how happy random science stuff makes him — and that enthusiasm is infectious (not Astrophage-infectious but pretty darn close). As he says in this interview,“My favorite part of writing is the research, and the math, and the figuring all that stuff out.” 
“The largest nuclear reactor on Earth makes about eight gigawatts. It would take that reactor two million years to create that much energy.”  How can you not love a book that shows such resourcefulness and competence in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds? Done with overexcited enthusiasm in the most endearing way, full of sarcastic self-deprecation and humor as coping mechanism, and teaching us science the same way as a very good junior high science teacher may explain concepts to a group of overexcitable preteens. And you betcha that Weir shows his work, and even those not well-versed in science should be able to get it as he really makes it very accessible and non-daunting.
“No, that’s not creepy at all. Being in a spaceship twelve light-years from home and having someone knock on the door is totally normal.”
Luckily, unlike Mark Watney, Ryland Grace is not quite alone. Yes, discovering the desiccated bodies of his crewmates makes him think that “I’m going to die out here. And I’m going to die alone” — but this is also a first contact story. (“I’ve gone from “sole-surviving space explorer” to “guy with wacky new roommate.” It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out.”) And it plays out in the best possible way, because our alien engineer Rocky is by far one of the best SF characters ever. I mean it. Ever. 
 “I don’t want to look dumb in front of the aliens.Because they’re surely watching me right now. Probably counting my limbs, noting my size, figuring out what part they should eat first, whatever.”————“Humanity’s first miscommunication with an intelligent alien race. Glad I could be a part of it.”
 

There are no space battles or invasions or bad guys (well, minus the star-eating microbe that’s doing its star-eating microbe thing while threatening the existence of at least two sentient species in the universe) — nothing that would be typical for the genre. Instead we have smart science and solid reasoning and friendly collaboration that are at the forefront and serve to even out the seemingly insurmountable odds. There is a problem that needs to be solved — and so we are going to solve it, and it’s so much fun. Andy Weir is back in full force, and I’m ridiculously happy about that.
“What I’m really looking for is something like “Information” or “Here to save humanity? Press this button to learn more!”————“I decide on a more tactile approach: I’m gonna start pushing buttons!Hopefully there’s no “Blow Up the Ship” button.”
Just like The Martian, it’s one of those books that restore the faith in humanity even for the most jaded of us. Because when we put our minds to it we can cooperate and collaborate and do wonderful things.
“But there’s no reason aliens would follow the righty-tighty-lefty-loosey rule, is there?”
Oh, and I think I highlighted about half of this book, and I’m running out of the ways to include quotes in my review, so yeah. I love it.
“Oh thank God. I can’t imagine explaining “sleep” to someone who had never heard of it. Hey, I’m going to fall unconscious and hallucinate for a while. By the way, I spend a third of my time doing this. And if I can’t do it for a while, I go insane and eventually die. No need for concern.”
5 stars, safely Astrophage-free.——————Also posted on my blog.——————My Hugo and Nebula Awards Reading Project 2022";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary
Klara and the Sun;Kazuo Ishiguro;2021;2020;303;3.75;361020;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Dystopia', 'Literary Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Contemporary'];From her place in the store, Klara, an Artificial Friend with outstanding observational qualities, watches carefully the behavior of those who come in to browse, and of those who pass on the street outside. She remains hopeful that a customer will soon choose her, but when the possibility emerges that her circumstances may change forever, Klara is warned not to invest too much in the promises of humans.In Klara and the Sun, Kazuo Ishiguro looks at our rapidly changing modern world through the eyes of an unforgettable narrator to explore a fundamental question: what does it mean to love?;"This book made me sad. Sad not because of the story but because I read it expecting the brilliance that the author of The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go can deliver in spades — and instead I got... well... this. A dull and lackluster book that slowly fizzles out under the burden of its unengaging narrative voice that neuters most of the impact from its bleak ending hiding inside the world’s saddest, most delusional servile optimism. Because by the time I plodded to the end, exhausted from the oppressive naïveté of the childlike servile narrator, this banality (that inside it, admittedly, packs a bit of a punch) actually started to make sense at its face value, because I had no desire left to care:
“There was something very special, but it wasn’t inside Josie. It was inside those who loved her.”
It’s a frustratingly vague story about a childlike AI - the titular solar-powered Klara - who is made to be a faithful and servile companion for a young teenage girl. Klara is a robot who is devoted to her kid Josie, observing the life around her and worshipping the Sun in the manner that stops being cute and becomes a bit disturbing. 
Klara’s voice full of childlike innocence mixed with some stilted “robotic” constructions, sadly, does not help create an interesting narration. She’s supposedly very observant and apparently very intelligent — but I know it only because we are told so by the other characters while Klara herself, through her inner monologue and actions, comes across as little but a humanoid teddy bear. For the life of me I could not understand what made her such a great companion, and how supposed supreme observational skills and intellect coexisted with such bland and dull inner (and outer, really) voice.  Me, after 250+ pages of Klara’s pensive yet unrelentless optimism.
And the vagueness of so many things in the story — the things that Klara’s narrative attention just slides off before anything becomes interesting — is really irritating. It’s not vague in a way that lends mystery feel but in a way that makes me wonder if the author himself had no idea about how certain things are supposed to work in this world, therefore sticking with just the blurry outlines and barest bones of worldbuilding. The focus is on Klara and Josie and maybe Rick — but they are not interesting enough to compensate for the vaguely futuristic dystopian sketch of the world around them. And all the potential in the relationships around Klara - the awful mother-daughter dynamic, the mother-Rick confrontation, the strange mother-son relationship, the absent father, the tensions between the elite and those left behind - all that was barely a glimpse as we kept circling back to Klara’s obsession with her owner and the Sun.The story itself lacks much of the subtlety that I came to expect from Ishiguro. Things that are warped and wrong are telegraphed loud and clear (think those interactions at the party between both children and adults, and most of Josie’s mother’s actions, and the lifted/unlifted contrasts through Rick and all the others who have the privilege he does not). The lines are painfully clear, drawn starkly like those frustratingly often appearing boxes in Klara’s overwhelmed vision — all giving it a feel of a story that wants to make itself obvious for a younger audience, but can be a bit trite and simplistic for older readers. Not to mention that the idea itself of replacing a dead child with a robot who learns to mimic that child’s behavior in order to lessen the sadness of a parent of a dead child is a concept too ridiculous to ever really take seriously for adults, but something that can be tried and debunked for younger readers. I do wonder if it was conceived as a sad tale for kids and got aged up to appeal to a wider audience?I expect better from a writer who penned The Remains of the Day - with all the subtlety and nostalgia and criticism of the unfair social order and musings on human nature and love and servility. Read that one instead.  It seems to have hit a perfect note for many readers, but for me it fell flat. And its denouement, meant to be pensive and bittersweet and maybe a bit anger-provoking behind the facade of sweetness made me just sigh in sadness that I got through all those pages for *this*. Because I kept hoping for the story to redeem its stiff bland journey by suddenly growing some metaphorical teeth in the end — and yes, Klara’s end basically as a discarded toy because ultimately nobody ever came to see her as a person and not a tool or a toy to be discarded once used because your worth itself isn’t intrinsic but dependent on others placing value in you was quietly heartbreaking and said a lot about us humans — but at that point my senses were too dulled by all the pages of Klara’s obsessively naive narration to really care and feel the impact as it should have been. Sadly, the story ended up apathetically lifeless, and that’s unfortunate.Maybe I’m too much of a cynic, and overwhelming majority of readers, judging by the overall rating, would disagree with my gripes, but it is what it is.2 stars.

Sea of Tranquility;Emily St. John Mandel;2022;2020;259;4.07;251676;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction'];A novel of art, time travel, love, and plague that takes the reader from Vancouver Island in 1912 to a dark colony on the moon five hundred years later, unfurling a story of humanity across centuries and space.Edwin St. Andrew is eighteen years old when he crosses the Atlantic by steamship, exiled from polite society following an ill-conceived diatribe at a dinner party. He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal--an experience that shocks him to his core. Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She's traveling all over Earth, but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive's best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him. When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe. A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our current moment.';"One of my most anticipated new releases of the year, Sea of Tranquility by Emily St. John Mandel, turned out to be a watered-down rewrite of Cloud Atlas. If I were David Mitchell, I don't know whether I'd feel flattered or just profoundly ripped off.Sea of Tranquility has exactly the same narrative structure as Cloud Atlas, consisting of interconnected stories that occur across different timelines, starting in the past and spanning into the future. Like Cloud Atlas, the opening storyline centers on a seafaring scholar traveling to the New World, whose ""street smarts"" pale in comparison to his ""book smarts."" Like Cloud Atlas, the next storylines involve a composer, an author, and a projection into a sci-fi future. Like Cloud Atlas, each storyline is interrupted partway through to begin the next nested story, and then all the stories wrap up in the second half of the book. The main difference is that the nested stories in Sea of Tranquility are only four layers deep, rather than six layers deep in Cloud Atlas.Emily St. John Mandel's writing is beautiful, as usual. However, she uses exactly the same writing style for all storylines covering three hundred years of history. The same 2020 writing style is applied to the historical account from 1912 and to the futuristic stories taking place in 2203 and 2401. She doesn't even attempt to alter her writing style to reflect these time differences. This is in sharp contrast to David Mitchell, who dramatically adjusted his writing style to reflect each different time period. This included making a projection of how he thought the English language would evolve in the near and far futures. Mitchell accomplished this task brilliantly, although it certainly made Cloud Atlas more difficult to read than Sea of Tranquility. In this way, the writing in Sea of Tranquility is simultaneously beautiful and lazy. I wish Emily St. John Mandel would have tried harder to capture the differences in writing style that one would expect over a span of 300 years.Like David Mitchell, Emily St. John Mandel is attempting to build an interconnected universe of characters spanning across books. However, the execution is quite clunky in Sea of Tranquility. The 2020 timeline overlaps with her previous novel, The Glass Hotel, and unfortunately the characters in the 2020 timeline of Sea of Tranquility spend about half of their dialogue recapping key plot points from The Glass Hotel. Also, the interconnections among the nested stories of Sea of Tranquility are made using a rather unconvincing time travel plot device, in contrast to the more subtle connections that David Mitchell provides in Cloud Atlas.I really wanted to love this book. I gave five stars to The Glass Hotel, which was brilliant in its subtle use of magical realism. Emily St. John Mandel's previous post-apocalyptic novel, Station Eleven, was also vastly superior to Sea of Tranquility. I preordered Sea of Tranquiltiy months in advance, in eager anticipation of its release date. This was such a letdown. I would have been far better off just rereading Cloud Atlas.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58446227-sea-of-tranquility
The Measure;Nikki Erlick;2022;2020;353;3.99;241137;no;['Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Book Club', 'Contemporary'];Eight ordinary people. One extraordinary choice.It seems like any other day. You wake up, pour a cup of coffee, and head out.But today, when you open your front door, waiting for you is a small wooden box. This box holds your fate inside: the answer to the exact number of years you will live.From suburban doorsteps to desert tents, every person on every continent receives the same box. In an instant, the world is thrust into a collective frenzy. Where did these boxes come from? What do they mean? Is there truth to what they promise?As society comes together and pulls apart, everyone faces the same shocking choice: Do they wish to know how long they’ll live? And, if so, what will they do with that knowledge?The Measure charts the dawn of this new world through an unforgettable cast of characters whose decisions and fates interweave with one another: best friends whose dreams are forever entwined, pen pals finding refuge in the unknown, a couple who thought they didn’t have to rush, a doctor who cannot save himself, and a politician whose box becomes the powder keg that ultimately changes everything.;Stories about glimpsing the future have always sucked me in. And The Measure is no different.One day, a little wooden box arrives for each person on the planet, no matter where they are. Inside is their name and a piece of string. It soon becomes clear that the length of the string stands for the length of their life. How will society cope with such knowledge? Will it ultimately strengthen bonds or break them apart?First of all, what a premise! I'm sure I'm not the only one who has ever thought to myself, I wonder how long I'll live. Well, this story takes that idea, expands it into a thought experiment, and just runs with it. And the result is absolutely fascinating, if not wholly unexpected.Where this story really shines is its focus on the characters. Even though this is speculative fiction, once the premise is established, this feels more character-driven than anything else. We have a large ensemble cast, and we slowly get to know them and watch them grow, even as their lives intertwine and touch each other.This story is clearly an allegory, meant to teach a lesson about what happens when humanity finds yet another way to divide itself. And the author is definitely passionate about her views, imbuing meaning into every thought and interaction between the characters. Unfortunately, it does come across heavy-handed and soppy at times, with everything so clearly spelled out for the reader again and again.The other issue I have is that by the time you reach the halfway point, it's pretty clear what's going to happen for the rest of the book. You can see how each storyline will play out, who will learn their lessons and who won't, and even how each character's life will end. All the subsequent conversations and thoughts really just spell out in long form what is already obvious, with no more surprises to be had, which does feel a bit disappointing for speculative fiction.Still, the negatives don't take away from the emotional impact of this story. Even though it tackles a heavy subject, it does so with a never-ending optimism that I found both appealing and heartwarming. Not to mention, I walk away with some food for thought about what I'd do if faced with the choice to know the length of my life. For that, I'll round it up to 4 stars.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58884736-the-measure
Cloud Cuckoo Land;Anthony Doerr;2021;2020;626;4.26;228958;no;['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical'];When everything is lost, it’s our stories that survive.How do we weather the end of things? Cloud Cuckoo Land brings together an unforgettable cast of dreamers and outsiders from past, present and future to offer a vision of survival against all odds.Constantinople, 1453:An orphaned seamstress and a cursed boy with a love for animals risk everything on opposite sides of a city wall to protect the people they love.Idaho, 2020:An impoverished, idealistic kid seeks revenge on a world that’s crumbling around him. Can he go through with it when a gentle old man stands between him and his plans?Unknown, Sometime in the Future:With her tiny community in peril, Konstance is the last hope for the human race. To find a way forward, she must look to the oldest stories of all for guidance.Bound together by a single ancient text, these tales interweave to form a tapestry of solace and resilience and a celebration of storytelling itself. Like its predecessor All the Light We Cannot See, Anthony Doerr’s new novel is a tale of hope and of profound human connection.;"Sometimes the things we think are lost are only hidden, waiting to be rediscovered.
Anthony Doerr has written a masterpiece of a tale, connecting five characters, over hundreds of years through their relationship to a single book. Cloud Cuckoo Land is an ancient story written by Antonius Diogenes around the first century C.E. (Only in the novel. While the author is real, the book was made up.) It tells of a shepherd, Aethon, seeking a magical, heavenly place in the sky, the “Cloud Cuckoo Land” of the title. Each of the five characters are introduced to this story, and we see how it impacts their lives. Each has characteristics that set them apart. But all have lost, or lose, at least one parent. Anthony Doerr - image from Boise State Public RadioWe meet Konstance, 14, on an interstellar, generational ship, maybe the late 21st century, maybe the 22nd. She is laying out on the floor of a large room the scraps of pages that comprise the book. (Sometimes he [Doerr] would lay out all these micro chapters on the floor so he could see them and discover the resonances between characters across space and time.  - from the NY Times interview) She was born on The Argos, and the plan is that she will not live long enough to reach the ship’s destination, but will grow to adulthood and raise a family there, passing down humanity’s culture so that someday, homo sapiens can rebuild on a new, unspoiled home world, Beta Oph2. Hopefully that planet will remain better off once people arrive. She is driven by her need to know, a boundless curiosity, and a willingness to think outside the ship.Anna is an orphan. In 15th century Constantinople we follow her from age 7 to early adolescence. She and her older sister, Maria, work as seamstresses in the house of Nicholas Kalaphates. It is a Dickensian world of exploitation of diverse sorts. Anna is far too bright to be denied the world of words, and, once exposed to it, she pursues that world doggedly. On her travels through the city on errands she comes across a class of boys being taught Greek, The Odyssey, and attends, surreptitiously. The master agrees to teach her privately in return for modest items. Her literacy makes her a suspect to the adults around her, a criminal to others, and possibly a witch to the most ignorant, but leads her to a ruined library and eventually, to Aethon. The Imperial Library at Constantinople [in better days] – image from Novo ScriptoriumOmeir was born in 1439, like Anna, but with a cleft lip and palate. The superstitious country people in his home town believed him cursed, demonic even, so he is driven out of town, exiled to a remote part of what is now Bulgaria, where he does his best to remain out of sight, to be raised by his grandfather. But Omeir is a survivor. He becomes a marvel at the care of oxen, raising and training two to immense proportions. The team of three are remarkable workers. Downside is that the new sultan demands Omeir, now an adolescent, and his oxen serve in his army. He is planning to lay siege to Constantinople, a city with walls that have withstood such attacks for over eleven hundred years. Omeir will encounter Aethon later. The oldest surviving map of Constantinople, by Cristoforo Buondelmonti, dated to 1422. The fortifications of Constantinople and of Galata, at the northern shore of the Golden Horn, are prominently featured. - image from WikipediaSeymour does not fit in. He lives with his mother, who struggles to get by on low-wage jobs. Probably on the spectrum, he struggles with more than the usual travails of growing up. He cannot, for example, tolerate loud sound. He cannot or will not remain in his seat at school. The world overwhelms him and when the pressure of it builds too high, he screams, which is not conducive to a successful school life. A class library outing brings him into contact with a whole new world, when the librarian, Marian, (surely a nod to The Music Man) hooks him up with nature books. He finds comfort in the natural world, befriending a large, amenable owl, and reveling in walks in the woods adjacent to his home. We follow him from childhood into adolescence and into his development as an eco-warrior. Seymour is the avatar of Doerr’s concerns about environmental degradation, presenting a generational cri du coeur, however misguided in its application, about the destruction of a following generation’s natural heritage.We see Zeno as a child. He realizes he is gay at an early age. But it is the 1940s in Idaho, and this is simply not allowed. He has to keep that part of himself hidden. We see him again as a POW during the Korean War, when he learns Greek, and as an octogenarian teacher. He lives in a small Idaho community, and is leading five students in a stage performance of Cloud Cuckoo Land, a book he translated from the Greek, well, from what bits remained of it. As with All the Light We Cannot See, Doerr’s 2014 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, his characters here are young. (Not necessarily for the entire book, but for a good chunk) He says writing from a child’s perspective allows one to “to see more nakedly some of the things that we’ve elided or erased in our minds because of age.” (From the NYTimes interview). Each comes to the world with their own personal content, but also with a sense of wonder. Anna is amazed by the vast universe of story that can be reached through literacy. Seymour is dazzled by nature and nature books. Konstance is amazed by the things she can see, the places she can visit, the knowledge she can gain in the virtual library on the ship. Zeno also finds a refuge and a world of possibility in his local library. For Omeir, it is the tales his grandfather tells him when they’re out trapping grouse that capture his imagination.While all the characters have their individual stories, Zeno and Seymour’s stories converge in today’s Lakeport, Idaho; (Doerr and family spend a lot of time in McCall, Idaho, a likely model for Lakeport) Anna and Omeir’s stories converge in the siege of Constantinople in the fifteenth century, and all their stories converge on the connection to that ancient book up through the somewhat near future of Konstance’s experience.  Mural at the Turkish Military Museum of the scene outside the walls of Constantinople in 1453 - image from Europe Between East and WestIt is these connections, these convergences, that provide the structure and core mystery of the book. How does this first century story find its way to fifteenth century Constantinople, to the world of today, and to the future in which Konstance lives? How is it preserved, by whom, and why? Asked about the spark for his focus on the preservation of literature, of culture, Doer said: 
I’m getting close to 50. And though I still feel and behave like a kid most of the time, my eyesight is fading, I can apparently injure myself while sleeping and my little baby boys are suddenly big hairy-legged job-working car-driving high school kids. I’m realizing that everything—youth, hairlines, memories, civilizations—fades. And the amazing technology that is a printed book seems to be one of the few human inventions that has outlived whole human generations. What a privilege it is to open a book like The Iliad and summon tales that entertained people almost 3,000 years ago.
The folks doing most of the preserving are librarians of one sort or another. Each of the characters has a relationship with a librarian, Zeno and Seymour with the librarians in Lakeport, Idaho, Anna with scribes in Constantinople, Omeir with Anna, and Konstance with the AI controller of her ship. 
I hope that my readers will be reminded that librarians serve as stewards of human memory—without librarians, we lose perhaps our most important windows into the human journey. - from the QBD interviewPart of his growing-up environment was spending a lot of time in libraries as his teacher mom often made use of them as a form of day care for Doerr and his brothers. It’s not like he minded. In fact, he even dedicated the book to librarians. 
They were a place where I felt completely safe. And just the miracle of them, there's something that - talk about peeling the scales off your eyes. Like, here's the work of all these masters available to you for free. And you can take them home. - from the NPR interviewAs with All the Light…, Doerr found inspirations for the elements of the book in diverse places. It was while researching the walls at Saint Malo for his prior book that he came across repeated references to the millennium-long impenetrability of the walls of Constantinople, and dug into that a lot deeper. He is also interested in how technology induces change. In All the Light… it was radio. Here it is gunpowder and advanced armaments in the 15th century, allowing a new level of violence in the assault on supposedly impervious walls. In the contemporary world it is the internet allowing in both a world of information and a cannonade of lies and manipulation. He sees the future as being driven by artificial intelligence.One of the things that most stuck with me was the portrayal of reading, particularly the reading of material to others, as not only an act of kindness, of affection, but also be a source of healing, and certainly comfort. There are several times when characters read to other characters who are ill, to positive effect. We are a species that relies on stories to make sense of our world, and to inspire, to spark imagination. The story of Aethon inspires all the main characters to dream of more, to dream of better, to dream beyond realistic possibility. Doerr enjoys tossing in a bit of classical reference spice. The ship Argos, of course, recalls Jason and his crew. Zeno is saved by a dog named Athena as Hercules was rescued by the goddess herself. There are plenty more of these. I would keep an eye out for owl imagery, and roses come in for some repeated attention as well. Walls get special attention. The big one in Constantinople is the most obvious, but Konstance has physical walls of her own she needs to get through. Seymour tries breaching a physical wall, as Zeno tries to defend one. The notion of paradise permeates. The title alone refers to an unrealizable fantasy of heaven. It is the heaven that Aethon pursues. For Zeno it is a place where he can be accepted, loved, while being his true self. Seymour is lured by the promise of a sylvan environmentalist camp where he can embrace nature with others of like mind. A development in his beloved woods is called Eden’s Gate (close enough to make one think of Heaven’s Gate). He and his mother live on Arcady Lane. For Anna it is a dream of a better life outside the city.How Doerr weaves all this together is a dazzling work of genius. He will leave you breathless, even as he shows you the construction of his multiple threads, bit by bit by bit. 
“That’s the real joy,” Doerr said, “the visceral pleasure that comes from taking these stories, these lives, and intersecting them, braiding them.” - from the NY Times interviewMirroring is employed extensively as the experiences of all five characters (and Aethon) repeat in one form or another for them all.The book lists at 640 hardcover pages. Do not take this at face value. In terms of actual words, Cuckoo Land is about the same length as All the Light. There are many pages holding only titles or section headings. There is a lot of white space. That does not make this a fast read. It would still be around 500 pages if one stripped it down to word-count alone. But it is less daunting than the presenting length of 640 pages. Also, Doerr writes in small chunks. You can always use a spare minute or two to drop in on this book and still get through a chapter or five. There is a reason for this. 
He had hit upon this approach for the most practical of reasons. As a parent, he couldn’t hope to get more than an hour or two of solid work done before having to attend to shuttling the boys to swim practice or some other activity. “I might have stumbled accidentally into that,” he said. - from the NY Times interviewWhile there are dark events that take place in this novel, the overall feel is one of optimism, of possibility, of persistence, and of the availability of beauty and hope to all, if only we can keep alive our connections to each other through time and place, keep alive hopes for a better place, for a better, meaningful life, and continue to dream impossible dreams. If you read nothing else this year, do yourself a favor and read Cloud Cuckoo Land, and be transported (no wings required) to a literary paradise by this book, which I hope will be read as long as there are people able to read. It is a heavenly book, and an immediate classic.
“Repository,” he finally says, “you know this word? A resting place. A text—a book—is a resting place for the memories of people who have lived before. A way for the memory to stay fixed after the soul has traveled on.”His eyes open very widely then, as though he peers into a great darkness.“But books, like people, die too. They die in fires or floods or in the mouths of worms or at the whims of tyrants. If they are not safeguarded, they go out of the world. And when a book goes out of the world, the memory dies a second death.”

Ready Player Two;Ernest Cline;2020;2020;370;3.43;163571;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Young Adult', 'Adventure'];An unexpected quest. Two worlds at stake. Are you ready?Days after winning Oasis founder James Halliday's contest, Wade Watts makes a discovery that changes everything. Hidden within Halliday's vaults, waiting for his heir to find, lies a technological advancement that will once again change the world and make the Oasis a thousand times more wondrous—and addictive—than even Wade dreamed possible. With it comes a new riddle, and a new quest—a last Easter egg from Halliday, hinting at a mysterious prize. And an unexpected, impossibly powerful, and dangerous new rival awaits, one who'll kill millions to get what he wants. Wade's life and the future of the Oasis are again at stake, but this time the fate of humanity also hangs in the balance.Lovingly nostalgic and wildly original as only Ernest Cline could conceive it, Ready Player Two takes us on another imaginative, fun, action-packed adventure through his beloved virtual universe, and jolts us thrillingly into the future once again.;"GAME. FINALLY. OVER.For f*ck’s sake. That’s the phrase that repeats itself over and over in my Kindle notes as I was slogging my way through this soulless cash grab of a clusterf*ck.It’s been a while since I’ve been this irritated by a book.  Time to rant.I got a huge kick out of its predecessor, Ready Player One, even if it often read like the reiteration of Wikipedia pages of the 1980s trivia. Yes, it was a trivia-laden wish fulfillment, but it appealed to our human instinct of rooting for an underdog against soulless evil. It’s hard not to root for a determined self-taught orphan who’s set to take on an evil entity and succeeds against all odds, resulting in a world that’s better than the one he started in. And since it led to a successful (although seriously dumbed down) movie and probably loads of cash for the creator of this world, we all knew the sequel was to come, and by Hollywood rules anyone could have predicted the most likely title. Of course it would be Ready Player TWO.
“Don’t you kids ever get tired of picking through the wreckage of a past generation’s nostalgia?” He stretched his arms out wide. “I mean, look around. The entire OASIS is like one giant graveyard, haunted by the undead pop-culture icons of a bygone era. A crazy old man’s shrine to a bunch of pointless crap.”
With a sequel, you have two paths you can take. One is to develop the world and the characters further, take risks, push boundaries. The other is to try to please the fans by sticking to the same exact formula that netted you success. Let’s guess which one this sequel follows.
 “Jeez Louise,” Shoto said, rolling his eyes. He turned to me. “We’re gonna be looking for Horcruxes next.”
Yeah. That one. 
Whether it makes sense or not, the point is to tediously recreate yet another quest for magical objects based on the poorly rhymed riddles made from beyond the grave by an oddball OASIS creator James Halliday and grounded in obscure 1980s trivia, with the same band of characters as before and the quest to get the girl. Even if all that seemingly was already achieved by the end of the first book.No problem. A few plot contrivances will still get us the quest with all the above, with riding into the sunset with the girl included. And hero worship, for the wish fulfillment pleasure.
“Or I could just log in to the OASIS, where I was treated like a god, and where everything now felt completely real—as real as the most vivid dreams feel while you’re having them.”
  
——————Wade Watts of the first book was easy to root for (being a plucky underdog and all that jazz). In this one, however, we get 
Wade 2.0
— now an entitled and petulant multi-gagillionnaire man-child OASIS owner who: - spends untold riches on decking out his gagillionnaire hideout, reluctantly trying to throw some cash onto the world’s issues before deciding that the world is going to hell anyway...
“To me, this room was hallowed ground. And I’d spent three years and millions of dollars re-creating the vast collection of classic videogame consoles and home computers Halliday had originally kept on display here.”
- and therefore is building an interstellar spaceship that will take a couple of dozen people from this planet when Earth’s problems become too real... 
“What we were doing was doomsday-prepping on a multibillionaire scale, packing the ultimate bugout bag—the means to escape the planet if, and when, everything went to shit.”
- all while bitching about people being mean to him because of his newfound fame, vengefully killing the livelihoods and the avatars of those who were meeeeeeeaaaaaan to him...
“They posted a music video to the ONI-net that racked up over a billion downloads before I had it taken offline. Then I sued the band for defamation and bankrupted each of its members. Which, of course, only made the public hate me even more.”“I gleefully zeroed out hundreds of trolls in this fashion. If someone talked shit about me, I found them and killed their avatar.”“A few dozen class-action lawsuits were filed against me. In the end, none of them amounted to anything; I was a multibillionaire with unlimited resources and the world’s best lawyers on my payroll, and there was no proof of wrongdoing on my part. But there was nothing I could do about the anger I’d caused.”
- and cyberstalking his ex-girlfriend who dumped his sorry ass after seeing him for the asshole he is after a week of dating (or, as Wade classily puts it, “making the beast with two backs” - since it’s vital for us to know that he’s no longer a virgin)...
 “Of course, Samantha was furious when she found out we’d spent over three hundred billion dollars to build a ship to escape our dying planet instead of using that money and manpower to help her try to save it.”
- while criminally breaching the privacy of OASIS users due to the privacy-circumventing abilities he has as the owner of the simulation...
“Then I went ahead and pulled up L0hengrin’s private account profile to find out her real-world identity. I justified violating her right to privacy as an OASIS user the way I always did—by telling myself it was necessary. […] What it really boiled down to was plain old curiosity. I was curious about who L0hengrin was in the real world. And I had the ability to find out. So I did.”“Since I’d already violated her privacy, I decided to go full-on Big Brother and have a look at her headset feeds. There were ten wide-angle surveillance cameras mounted on the exterior of each ONI headset, which allowed the wearer to keep an eye on their body and its surroundings from inside the OASIS. The Robes of Anorak gave me access to a secret submenu on every ONI user’s account, where I could monitor the video feeds coming from those cameras. Meaning I had the ability to spy on people in their homes. This was one of GSS’s uglier secrets, and there would be riots and class-action suits galore if our customers ever found out about it. But these were exceptional circumstances, I assured myself.”
 
- while thoughtlessly releasing barely tested plug-into-the-brain hardware and software because it’s apparently cool...
 “Now instead of following their favorite celebrity on social media, ONI users could become their favorite celebrity for a few minutes each day. Exist inside their skin. Live short, heavily curated fragments of far more glamorous lives.”
- and enjoying his own perceived superiority of a rich brat with a life better than that of the resentful plebs...
“And yes, the rational part of my brain knew that the vast majority of the people who trolled us online were acting out, due to crushing disappointment with their own miserable lives. And who could blame them? Reality was completely miserable for a vast majority of the world’s population. I should’ve taken pity on the sad, pathetic souls who had nothing better to do with their time than vent their frustrations by attacking me and my friends.”
- while watching tons of porn that apparently opens his eyes to the idea of tolerance and empathy...
“Thanks to years of surfing the ONI-net, I now knew what it felt like to be all kinds of different people, having all different kinds of sex. I’d experienced sex with women while being another woman, and sex with men as both a woman and a man. I’d done playback of several different flavors of straight and gay and nonbinary sex, just out of pure curiosity[…]”
- and pats himself on the back for it because he apparently “helps” people through the power of distraction from their very real problems.
 “The ONI made the lives of impoverished people all around the world a lot more bearable—and enjoyable. People didn’t mind subsisting on dried seaweed and soy protein when they could log on to the ONI-net and download a delicious five-course meal anytime they pleased.”
Yeah.—————And then the ridiculous quest starts and OF F*CKING COURSE in the end Wade turns out to be super-specially right about everything and none of his mistakes or carelessness matter because turns out he’s not a bumbling game-addicted idiot but a visionary. His awful personality that had alienated his friends and girlfriend prior to the events of the quest suddenly is forgotten and from the first moments of the actual quest suddenly he’s on excellent terms with his former friends, and his ex-girlfriend (who a few pages ago couldn’t stand to even be in the same virtual room as he) is making eyes at him and compliments him and kisses him, and everything is suddenly reset to hunky-dory with no explanation and no inner logic, all within the 12 hours of the quest (or even within its first 30 minutes). 
The ridiculous quest itself is now artificially compressed to 12 hours, so there is no time to think and logically work out the clues (the quest in the last book, in case you forgot, takes about a year to complete). With the time crunch Wade always very conveniently has a sidekick or two who not only instantly figure out the clue (and the very first clue he actually buys, Sixers-like, for a billion dollars from an adoring fan) but also apparently have already excelled at relevant quests at some point off-page and therefore are able to just walk Wade right through them, screaming directions at him and preemptively grabbing all the quest items and artifacts that they already know will be needed. That’s how we get through John Hughes movies quest, Prince quest and Silmarillion quest — by Wade following others’ directions. Wade is really unnecessary here and contributes almost nothing.
“Luckily, she already knew exactly where and how to obtain each of the five pieces.”
But hey, all those quests would look great in the movie. Which is why, I assume, they were written the way they were. For an easier adaptation to eventual future screenplay. And bumbling sociopathic obsessed idiot Wade Watts of course ends up *totally right* at the end, which his girlfriend Art3mis (the only one with the semblance of common sense through most of this clusterf*ck) explicitly admits. And the petulant childish gagillionnaire gets to live ever after in bliss (no, seriously, spoiler - if you care literally ever after, through digital immortality that he so conveniently gets to use — although, of course, it had been developed for his use by Halliday).
“I was wrong,” she told me, after she’d told Wade. “This technology does make a lot of people’s lives infinitely better than they would be without it.”
 
Not to mention that Cline seems to have abandoned any pretense of organically introducing the trivia bits into the story, instead just lumping them in every other sentence and eventually having Wade just read stuff off the “Gunterpedia”. Seriously, I got quite bored reading two whole pages of a literal arcade game walkthrough. It seems like a poorly-done fanfic of the first book, really. Ugh.
“I searched my memory, but the only woman hero of a Rieko Kodama game I could think of was Alis Lansdale, the fifteen-year-old protagonist of Phantasy Star I—and that was a home console game. Released for the Sega Master System in Japan in 1987, and in the United States in 1988.”
I think what the author was banking on was that the same tricks that earned the first book its legions of fans (myself included) would suffice to turn this one into a smash hit as well. And maybe it will. I mean, I contributed to its sales myself - $14.99 that I’ll never see again. But you can’t be just phoning it based just on the successful formula for Ready Player One while relying on a despicable character with no consequences and a half-baked plot based on nostalgia for the first book.To sum up: What a fragging boring mess. But it will make an entertaining movie with all kinds of cool flashy special effects.But while having potential as a future screenplay, it’s just not a good book.1.5 stars. After a year, I can’t recall why I rounded up my rating, so rounding down to 1 star it deserves.

A Psalm for the Wild-Built;Becky  Chambers;2021;2020;160;4.27;125428;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Novella', 'Audiobook', 'LGBT', 'Queer'];"ASIN B08H831J18 moved to the more recent editionCenturies before, robots of Panga gained self-awareness, laid down their tools, wandered, en masse into the wilderness, never to be seen again. They faded into myth and urban legend.Now the life of the tea monk who tells this story is upended by the arrival of a robot, there to honor the old promise of checking in. The robot cannot go back until the question of ""what do people need?"" is answered. But the answer to that question depends on who you ask, and how. They will need to ask it a lot. Chambers' series asks: in a world where people have what they want, does having more matter?";"If this is not your first Becky Chambers book, you know what to expect. Ever since her first novel The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet she’s been writing what I can only call “comfort science fiction/ cozypunk”, showing the worlds where you would really love to live, the worlds that learned from mistakes of the past and moved on in better directions, the worlds mostly inhabited by genuinely nice people, with everything having a feeling of an unironically happy hippie commune, complete with earnest conversations about life and its meaning.And that’s what we get here, in a tiny contemplative novella whose dedication simply states, “For anybody who could use a break.”
 “This had been the way of things since the Transition, when the people had redivided the surface of their moon. Fifty percent of Panga’s single continent was designated for human use; the rest was left to nature, and the ocean was barely touched at all. It was a crazy split, if you thought about it: half the land for a single species, half for the hundreds of thousands of others. But then, humans had a knack for throwing things out of balance. Finding a limit they’d stick to was victory enough.”
  
It’s a story of a utopia, a planet where humanity left behind the Factory Age and moved on to sustainable and highly spiritual (as opposed to dogmatically religious) life in harmony with nature, with dwellings made of biodegradable materials, half a planet left for wilderness with which you do not interfere, and existence of tea monks who travel from scenic village to scenic village setting pop-up tea shops where one can drink their sorrows away with herbal teas. Because people will still have existential crises and will get hit with wanderlust even in the most inconvenient times.
 “I’m tired,” Dex said softly. “My work doesn’t satisfy me like it used to, and I don’t know why. I was so sick of it that I did a stupid, dangerous thing, and now that I’ve done it, I don’t know what to do next. I don’t know what I thought I’d find out here, because I don’t know what I’m looking for. I can’t stay here, but I’m scared about going back and having that feeling pick right back up where it left off. I’m scared, and I’m lost, and I don’t know what to do.”
In this world a long time ago robots somehow gained consciousness and parted ways with humanity to live in the wilderness, respecting each other’s choices and agency. The departure of robots apparently becomes a catalyst for the betterment of humanity. And now for the first time a human tea monk Dex (on a quest fueled by ennui and a longing for purpose) and a robot Splendid Speckled Mosscap (on a journey to find out about humans and what makes them tick) meet and engage in philosophical discussions and debates and lay foundations for a beautiful friendship.  
This entire novella is a philosophical dialogue in the setting of ecological paradise, a cozy version of Plato’s symposium held in the wilderness with some tea.
 “You’re an animal, Sibling Dex. You are not separate or other. You’re an animal. And animals have no purpose. Nothing has a purpose. The world simply is. If you want to do things that are meaningful to others, fine! Good! So do I! But if I wanted to crawl into a cave and watch stalagmites with Frostfrog for the remainder of my days, that would also be both fine and good. You keep asking why your work is not enough, and I don’t know how to answer that, because it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. You don’t need to justify that, or earn it. You are allowed to just live. That is all most animals do.”
This is not a story of survival or conflict or discovery. It is a story of dissatisfaction even with the most comfortable life in the most ideal world imaginable, the world which by any definition is a utopia — and not because of any inherent flaws in the utopia, not because every utopia harbors within it the seeds of dystopia, but purely because human spirit gets restless sometimes even in the best of circumstances, even in the world that I would give my left ovary to inhabit.You see, living in our current world that is not quite moving towards the lovely green utopia of Chambers’ planet, I do tend to view the world through less rose-tinted glasses, focusing more on survival and security as priorities and sidelining the finer things in life. But here we are a bit past that, those lucky bastards. Here they can afford to focus on spiritual pleasure and not on the basic needs.
 “Dex nodded at the ruined factory. “And the people who made places like this weren’t at fault either—at least, not at first. They just wanted to be comfortable. They wanted their children to live past the age of five. They wanted everything to stop being so fucking hard. Any animal would do the same—and they do, if given the chance.”
Yes, the questions Chambers raises are those “first world problems” that I’m usually the first one to want to shrug off — but they are very important to the human nature. When you have the luxury of having your basic needs met and comfort of security in life, the nagging feelings of dissatisfaction and desire for purpose or fulfillment or wanderlust will come to the forefront, because, as Dex notes, humans need more than just focus on survival alone — once that basic need has been fulfilled.
“Survival alone isn’t enough for most people. We’re more than surviving now. We’re thriving. We take care of each other, and the world takes care of us, and we take care of it, and around it goes. And yet, that’s clearly not enough, because there’s a need for people like me. No one comes to me hungry or sick. They come to me tired, or sad, or a little lost. It’s like you said about the … the ants. And the paint. You can’t just reduce something to its base components. We’re more than that. We have wants and ambitions beyond physical needs. That’s human nature as much as anything else.”
All in all, it’s a quietly optimistic, comforting, heartfelt book, focusing on the nuances of human soul in a very good world inhabited by very good people and robots. To complete the ambiance, I would have needed a hot cocoa and a warm cozy blanket on a pleasantly rainy day — but we are in the middle of a hot dry fiery California summer, so there goes that pleasant atmosphere.  
————And yet some things kept nagging at me, aided by that ever-present cynicism that tends to pop up at inconvenient moments.One was the robot character, Mosscap. It’s pretty indistinguishable from a human, with the same everything — speech patterns, logic, and even struggles with math and numbers. The subtitle of this new series - Monk and Robot — implies differences, and Mosscap itself states that “We don’t have to fall into the same category to be of equal value” — but to me they were reading as almost indistinguishable in voice and behavior, and that left me a bit unsatisfied. The other issue was the ending — or the lack thereof, because this novella really should have been part 1 of a larger novel, perhaps the exposition at the beginning of a longer book. And tea. After “Ancillary Justice” series, I’m a bit twitchy when tea makes on-page appearance. Another one was the luxurious tease of this hope for the future. Because it just IS? We are told that the Transition happened from the grim Factory Age to this idyllic paradise, and my brain just keeps nagging at me about the implausibility of that given human nature and drives, and my inner cynicism starts running rampant — that cynicism that finds it a bit too cozy and luxurious to read about the world that might as well have come from a pretty concept picture of ecological paradise. There is a point where cozy and comforting becomes too much, and I felt that we are dangerously close to that boundary here. It’s a fable, I kept convincing myself, but my inner cynic kept muttering unpleasant remarks that would not be welcomed on planet Panga (hey, I just got it — Panga is pretty much “Pangaea”, right?).It feels like a dessert, a meringue that is soft and fluffy and will be very nice after a solid meat and potatoes course — but without that course not as satisfying. You gotta be in the right mood for it, and I don’t think I entirely was. I like my books with just a smidgeon more of teeth and bite, but that’s not Becky Chambers fault but mine entirely. Her book will be perfect for a perfect reader, and this time I wasn’t among them. Maybe I’ll feel less cynical next time.3.5 stars.  Less cynical among us will love it. 
“The robot thought. “I have wants and ambitions too, Sibling Dex. But if I fulfill none of them, that’s okay. I wouldn’t—” It nodded at Dex’s cuts and bruises, at the bug bites and dirty clothes. “I wouldn’t beat myself up over it.”Dex turned the mug over and over in their hands. “It doesn’t bother you?” Dex said. “The thought that your life might mean nothing in the end?”“That’s true for all life I’ve observed. Why would it bother me?” Mosscap’s eyes glowed brightly. “Do you not find consciousness alone to be the most exhilarating thing? Here we are, in this incomprehensibly large universe, on this one tiny moon around this one incidental planet, and in all the time this entire scenario has existed, every component has been recycled over and over and over again into infinitely incredible configurations, and sometimes, those configurations are special enough to be able to see the world around them. You and I—we’re just atoms that arranged themselves the right way, and we can understand that about ourselves. Is that not amazing?”

The School for Good Mothers;Jessamine Chan;2022;2020;336;3.54;112269;no;['Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult'];"An alternate cover edition of ISBN 9781982156121 can be found here.In this taut and explosive debut novel, one lapse in judgement lands a young mother in a government reform program where custody of her child hangs in the balance.Frida Liu is struggling. She doesn’t have a career worthy of her Chinese immigrant parents’ sacrifices. What’s worse is she can’t persuade her husband, Gust, to give up his wellness-obsessed younger mistress. Only with their angelic daughter Harriet does Frida finally feel she’s attained the perfection expected of her. Harriet may be all she has, but she’s just enough.Until Frida has a horrible day.The state has its eyes on mothers like Frida — ones who check their phones while their kids are on the playground; who let their children walk home alone; in other words, mothers who only have one lapse of judgement. Now, a host of government officials will determine if Frida is a candidate for a Big Brother-like institution that measures the success or failure of a mother’s devotion. Faced with the possibility of losing Harriet, Frida must prove that she can live up to the standards set for mothers — that she can learn to be good.This propulsive, witty page-turner explores the perils of “perfect” upper-middle-class parenting, the violence enacted upon women by the state and each other, and the boundless love a mother has for her daughter.";"Female dystopian that doesn’t hold up against the competitionFrida Liu has a very bad parenting day resulting in The State sentencing her to a one-year school to become a better mother. What will the school be like and will Frida be reunited with her daughter?The School for Good Mothers is Jessamine Chan’s debut novel, and it was a solid first draft in a very competitive subgenre. This book is intended to be an updated The Handmaid’s Tale; however, The Handmaid’s Tale it is not. Most important: the storytelling was off in The School for Good Mothers. The program was one-year long, and it felt like I was reading this book for one year. What happened to chapters with cliff-hanger endings? The prose was like reading a newspaper article, fact-driven, flat, unemotional. However, facts alone don’t usually make great books. The emotions need to be stirred, and there needs to be some excitement/action, but this book wasn’t written that way. If I was the editor, I would start with the last two chapters and write something like, “If only Gust could have kept it in his pants…” then shifted to a flashback. Then, I would flash back to the end of the book with “Ms. Liu. Ms. Liu. Your case is being called.” Each character’s testimony should have been presented with more flashbacks. Ms. Chan, this book review brings to mind a quote by Theodore Roosevelt: “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again…who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” In this instance, I am the critic in the cheap seats, but I hope that this review isn’t seen as a mean barb but an encouragement, an encouragement to shake off the dust and sweat and blood, to pick up your lance and shield once again and continue your journey, because there is a story worthy of telling in this book. Overall, The School for Good Mothers had good content and messaging buried within the text, but the format didn’t work and is in need of some heavy editing and rewrites. *Thanks, NetGalley, for a free copy of this book in exchange for my fair and honest opinion.2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57846320-the-school-for-good-mothers
Upgrade;Blake Crouch;2022;2020;352;3.81;100341;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Dystopia'];You are the next step in human evolution. At first, Logan Ramsay isn’t sure if anything’s different. He just feels a little . . . sharper. Better able to concentrate. Better at multitasking. Reading a bit faster, memorizing better, needing less sleep.But before long, he can’t deny it: Something’s happening to his brain. To his body. He’s starting to see the world, and those around him—even those he loves most—in whole new ways.The truth is, Logan’s genome has been hacked. And there’s a reason he’s been targeted for this upgrade. A reason that goes back decades to the darkest part of his past, and a horrific family legacy.Worse still, what’s happening to him is just the first step in a much larger plan, one that will inflict the same changes on humanity at large—at a terrifying cost.Because of his new abilities, Logan’s the one person in the world capable of stopping what’s been set in motion. But to have a chance at winning this war, he’ll have to become something other than himself. Maybe even something other than human.And even as he’s fighting, he can’t help wondering: what if humanity’s only hope for a future really does lie in engineering our own evolution?Intimate in scale yet epic in scope, Upgrade is an intricately plotted, lightning-fast tale that charts one man’s thrilling transformation, even as it asks us to ponder the limits of our humanity—and our boundless potential.;"I dreamed of who I used to be.Of who, or what, I might become.
This right here. This is what I've been waiting for. With Upgrade, Blake Crouch has finally written a successor worthy of Dark Matter.You might think that I have some sort of rigorous, scientific method for determining what makes a 5-star read for me. But honestly, it's just a feeling. I get this tingle that goes from the back of my head all the way down my spine. And when I feel it, I know that I've found something special and worth savoring. And that's what happened here.When I think of a great science fiction story, I think of something bold and imaginative, capable of surprising me and challenging my preconceived notions, one that reaches to the root of what it means to be human, and takes us on a journey of where we've been and where we're going. And this story is all that and more.Just like most Blake Crouch novels, this book feels accessible, even to those readers who don't normally indulge in the genre. And a large reason is because it reads like a thriller. It's relentlessly paced and utterly riveting, and I can't imagine trying to put it down once I've started. Every chapter held surprises and revelations, and even when I thought I was getting an inkling of where it might be headed, it still managed to prove me wrong.While the science in here is interesting, I suspect most readers will connect with it for far more reasons than that. It seamlessly blends a whole bunch of interesting and timely topics, from philosophy to ethics, evolution to the environment, that elevates it from just a story that passes through one's mind to a story that's truly arresting and memorable.I've noticed that Crouch is particularly adept at putting the reader in the shoes of the main character. We feel his pain, understand his choices, and appreciate the difficulty of his dilemmas. And it makes me wonder, what would I do when given such impossible choices? Would I have what it takes to sacrifice everything to do what needs to be done? I'd like to think so, and it's definitely an interesting thought to contemplate.A word of caution here. I normally include a small tease of the story I'm reviewing, but you'll notice I haven't included any such information here. It's because even that little bit feels like a spoiler. In fact, I've been careful not to allude to anything that happens in the entire story, and that's on purpose.I went into this completely blind and absolutely loved the initial pages as it set up the premise and got into the heart of the story. There were so many things that surprised me and those reveals contributed so much to the delightful experience of reading this book. After I finished, I read the blurb on the back, and it pretty much gives it all away. So my suggestion is to skip the blurb altogether and just go right into it. You'll be glad you did.Ever since Blake Crouch came out with Dark Matter, I've been waiting patiently for another book of his that will grab me just as much. (Recursion wasn't it, unfortunately.) I wanted another that would work on so many levels: a riveting and unputdownable thriller on the surface, but also thought-provoking and scientifically intriguing, and relatable to every reader even though the premise is so outrageous. And it seems my patience has finally paid off. ~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Dark MatterRecursion~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59838811-upgrade

Fugitive Telemetry;Martha Wells;2021;2020;168;4.31;74753;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Novella', 'Mystery', 'Adult', 'Space'];No, I didn’t kill the dead human. If I had, I wouldn’t dump the body in the station mall.When Murderbot discovers a dead body on Preservation Station, it knows it is going to have to assist station security to determine who the body is (was), how they were killed (that should be relatively straightforward, at least), and why (because apparently that matters to a lot of people—who knew?)Yes, the unthinkable is about to happen: Murderbot must voluntarily speak to humans!Again!;"2021 is looking to be a pretty special year. No, I don’t mean the vaccine, although that’s pretty amazing. No, I mean Murderbot is back in a solid novella. While I’m contractually bound to not repeat the approximately 80 highlights I made while reading, I can assure you that it is filled with ‘Bot’s trademark sarcastic thoughts on humans, slow thought processes, and complicated facial expressions.""Oh good, maybe the security level would go from barely adequate to mostly adequate. I didn't make an expression because I knew Indah would be more annoyed by me not reacting than by me reacting.""In Fugitive Telemetry, ‘Bot is on Preservation Station and has recently discovered a dead–cough, deceased–human. This is odd, because they appear murdered on a station with a threat assessment of 7% “(to make it drop lower than that we’d have to be on an uninhabited planet.)” ‘Bot jumps right into the investigation, spurred on by concern that GrayCris might be involved. In this case, it’s somewhat constrained from using full capabilities due to general unfriendliness of the human Station Security team and its honor system. It has some new humans to work with, although a few of our familiar friends make an appearance. In timeline terms, it takes place before Network Effect.I received notice of my ARC approval after a marathon day vaccinating people (10 stations, 573 people, thank you all very much for getting shots), and while fulfilled, was quite exhausted. I waged a brief debate with myself: do I crash in bed? Do I save it as a reward after I write my two other reviews and finish my two other less-interesting books? Or do I go for it?I think you know what I did.While I read, my day fell away, page by page, replaced by sarcastic observations and extremely dry wit. ‘Bot, how I’ve missed you. “I hadn’t had as much relevant experience in that time. But what I did have were thousands of hours of category mystery media, so I had a lot of theoretical knowledge that was possibly anywhere from 60 to 70 percent inaccurate shit.”The only real question was how long until I re-read all the novellas? Endless thanks to Netgalley and Tor/Forge Books for an ebook ARC.

To Sleep in a Sea of Stars;Christopher Paolini;2020;2020;880;3.8;61725;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Adult', 'Space'];Kira Navárez dreamed of life on new worlds. Now she's awakened a nightmare. During a routine survey mission on an uncolonized planet, Kira finds an alien relic. At first she's delighted, but elation turns to terror when the ancient dust around her begins to move.As war erupts among the stars, Kira is launched into a galaxy-spanning odyssey of discovery and transformation. First contact isn't at all what she imagined, and events push her to the very limits of what it means to be human. While Kira faces her own horrors, Earth and its colonies stand upon the brink of annihilation. Now, Kira might be humanity's greatest and final hope...;"Upon finishing To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, I leaned toward rating it 4.5-stars and not rounding up.Admittedly, there were certain aspects I didn't love; some areas where I felt the story dragged a bit. However, after having time to reflect on it as a whole, this is absolutely a 5-star book for me. I CANNOT STOP thinking about it!This novel is quite the accomplishment for Paolini. If I am remembering the Author's Note correctly, he worked on this project for 9-years and it shows.In the beginning, we meet and follow Kira Navarez, a xenobiologist, who discovers an alien relic while on a survey mission to an uninhabited planet.The relic isn't as dormant as it first appears and ends up first contaminating and then binding with Kira. This event has lasting repercussions, leaving her feeling personally responsible for some of the negative events that follow.This is a story of first contact. I wasn't aware of that going in, although it says it directly in the synopsis, I missed it somehow.I love first contact stories. It's actually one of my favorite subgenres within Science Fiction. It is so well done here, you can definitely tell that Paolini is a SciFi fan himself.This story is vast. In fact, it is hard to give brief plot points that would sum up the entirety of this novel's scope. There is so much that happens from the first time Kira comes in contact with the alien suit to the stunning conclusion.Reading this, I became so attached to Kira and the other characters as well. The crew is the perfect rag-tag group of lovable rebels.I loved how Paolini incorporated humor and witty banter into this story. It made the characters seem so real; they were reacting how you expect people in real life to react to such crazy and dire circumstances.I was completely engaged throughout my time reading this. It did not feel like a close to 900-page story. I got through it way more quickly than I had anticipated.I would note this is straight-up, good old-fashioned Science Fiction. If you are thinking this will be more SFF, based on Paolini's past works, you could be disappointed.If you do not normally enjoy Science Fiction, you may not like this. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi though, you will eat this up. The delicious science bits are woven throughout. Start-to-finish, the details are incredible.Also, if you do pick this book up, be sure to read through the Appendices at the end. There's definitely a lot of interesting supplemental material there. My favorite being a timeline of events that lead up to the state of the world within this story. It basically fills in the blanks between our current world, up through Kira's time. It's not very long, but I found it to be a helpful addition to the story.The audiobook is especially fantastic, if you think that would be a good option for you. At first, I was thinking, why didn't they go full cast, as there are quite a few characters. After getting into it, however, I could see why.The narrator, Jennifer Hale, did an absolutely tremendous job bringing this story to life. She is a very talented voice artist and I was shocked to learn that this is actually her first audiobook.

A Prayer for the Crown-Shy;Becky  Chambers;2022;2020;152;4.41;60066;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Novella', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'LGBT'];After touring the rural areas of Panga, Sibling Dex (a Tea Monk of some renown) and Mosscap (a robot sent on a quest to determine what humanity really needs) turn their attention to the villages and cities of the little moon they call home.They hope to find the answers they seek, while making new friends, learning new concepts, and experiencing the entropic nature of the universe.Becky Chambers's new series continues to ask: in a world where people have what they want, does having more even matter?They're going to need to ask it a lot.;"The dedication for the first book states, “For anybody who could use a break,” and for this book it reads, “For anybody who doesn’t know where they’re going.” It must be said that half the joy of reading this series is one of a promise kept. There is something in these books that goes right to the heart of things. Becky Chambers is fantastic at expressing so precisely things I can talk about endlessly: like the transformative power of love and queer community, the beauty and strangeness of how we eke meaning out of our surroundings, and how joy and beauty can sometimes be so mundane that, in that simplicity, they become utterly radical. I love the author's unerring talent for capturing hard feelings with unexpected words, how sometimes Chambers would quietly unload on the page a line so powerful, so devastating, that it would press the breath from my lungs: “How am I supposed to tell people they’re good enough as they are when I don’t think I am?” These have quickly become my favorite moments, when reading begins to feel like overhearing a confession, a pouring out of inarticulable truths that can only emerge when you finally find someone with whom you can just sit on the ground and breathe. Which is, incidentally, what our Monk and Robot duo—Dex and Mosscap—have found in each other. This is what I love most about these books—how they give language to those of us who never learned in college or media or life how to deal with being lost, with feeling that you have wandered out of the right life, forgotten who you are and kept turning up in all the wrong places assuming different faces. The kind of lost you cannot help and cannot explain; there is only the feeling, deeper than words, that something is missing, something you hadn’t named yet, or perhaps you are simply not letting yourself know. This is the kind of lost some of us might go our whole lives trying to accommodate because it hurts too much to face it head-on, like pulling your own heart out by the roots. Monk & Robot retroactively renders that painful experience, familiar to many of us, less painful just by virtue of seeing its characters, truly seeing them, and placing itself in their corner. To its readers, these books speak with intention and kindness and unrelenting feeling. They say, “I see you too, and I get it.” And sometimes there is nothing more powerful, or more intoxicating, than that.These themes are as tenderly explored in this series as everything else. Inside the small economy of a novella, Chambers gives them both weight and weightlessness all at once: they are not so grim or overwhelming that they overshadow the overall charm and playfulness and humor of the story (which is frankly feels-pummelingly good!), but they nonetheless assume a fully weighted presence in the narrative (I love, for example, how the meandering quality of the plot in this book echoes so perfectly the searching lost-ness that the characters feel). In short, I love this series so much, it is as generous and loving as it is marvelous and deeply confronting. If you feel that the world is too much, and you're wearying to escape, these books should definitely be next on your To-Read queue.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40864030-a-prayer-for-the-crown-shy
The Kaiju Preservation Society;John Scalzi;2022;2020;264;3.99;57924;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Humor', 'Adventure', 'Adult'];"When COVID-19 sweeps through New York City, Jamie Gray is stuck as a dead-end driver for food delivery apps. That is, until Jamie makes a delivery to an old acquaintance, Tom, who works at what he calls ""an animal rights organization."" Tom's team needs a last-minute grunt to handle things on their next field visit. Jamie, eager to do anything, immediately signs on.What Tom doesn't tell Jamie is that the animals his team cares for are not here on Earth. Not our Earth, at least. In an alternate dimension, massive dinosaur-like creatures named Kaiju roam a warm and human-free world. They're the universe's largest and most dangerous panda and they're in trouble.It's not just the Kaiju Preservation Society that's found its way to the alternate world. Others have, too--and their carelessness could cause millions back on our Earth to die.";"Maybe John Scalzi’s books won’t change your life but they can make living it just a bit less unpleasant.Kaiju Preservation Society (for those like me who are insufficiently cool, for “kaiju” basically think “Godzilla”, but nuclear reactor-powered. Yes, just roll with that) is light-hearted and very funny, full of present-day references and neverending quips and snark, almost a meme in book form. It’s meant to entertain above anything, with a bit of self-aware “reverse lampshading”. And banter — or dear, the banter comes in kaiju-sized chunks and is perfect. But let’s have Scalzi himself explain things just a bit in his Author’s Note: 
“KPS is not, and I say this with absolutely no slight intended, a brooding symphony of a novel. It’s a pop song. It’s meant to be light and catchy, with three minutes of hooks and choruses for you to sing along with, and then you’re done and you go on with your day, hopefully with a smile on your face. I had fun writing this, and I needed to have fun writing this. We all need a pop song from time to time, particularly after a stretch of darkness.”  Jamie Gray gets fired at the start of the pandemic and ends up spending a bit of time delivering food for füdmüd, a delivery app aimed at enriching the legacy billionaire owner — until his lucky break comes in the form of job invitation to work for an “animal rights” organization that takes care of large animals. He’s supposed to “lift things”, basically — the only grunt around without a PhD. (“My master’s thesis had been on bioengineering in science fiction from Frankenstein through the Murderbot novellas.”) Only later Jamie finds out that we are talking Godzilla scale creatures, on a parallel Earth where everything is ready to kill you. Oh, and they are powered by nuclear reactors, just to add to improbable fun. Indeed it’s “the Foreign Legion for nerds”.
 “So we’re the monster police, too,” I said to Tom. “Correct,” he replied. “The only real question is, who are the monsters?” “They ask that question in every monster movie, you know. It’s an actual trope.” “I know,” Tom said. “What does it say about us that it’s relevant every single time they ask it?” Yes, it’s hilarious and fun and at times almost ridiculous in a way a combo of a blockbuster and a sitcom can be. It certainly doesn’t take itself very seriously, and in that lies its charm. It’s very much an escapist piece, and there’s not a single thing wrong with that. Kaiju as nuclear-powered ecological systems full of bloodthirsty parasites? Sounds fun. An evil villain who really needs a moustache for requisite moustache-twirling? No problem. Heartless billionaire getting his comeuppance? Yes, please. It’s just delightful this way, even for those of us who before this book thought “Kaiju” was just a funny word.
“I was just thinking that Edward’s Tumescent Cloaca would have been an excellent band name.” “Emo, obviously,” Kahurangi said. “Their first album glistened with promise, but their follow-up was a little flaccid.” “Their third album was really shitty.” “To be fair, the competition was stiff that year.” “I just thought that they should have showed more spunk.”
4 stars, with the potential of adding the fifth once I get my hands on Wil Wheaton’s narration.(Also, John Scalzi would be an awesome person to have drinks with.)————————And if this passage doesn’t make you chuckle let alone laugh out loud, we are probably not meant to be friends.“Also, really quickly, let’s talk side effects. For the next couple of days you might feel achy or sore, and you might run a slight fever. If that happens, don’t panic, that’s perfectly normal. It just means your body is learning about the diseases we want it to fight.” “All right.” “Also, at least a couple of these are going to make you feel ravenously hungry. Go ahead and eat all you want, but avoid excessively fatty foods, since one of these is going to tell your body to purge fats in a way that absolutely challenges normal sphincter control.” “That’s … not great.” “It’s a mess. Seriously, don’t even think about trying to fart for the next eighteen hours. It’s not a fart. You will regret it.” “I don’t like you.” “I get that a lot. Also, you may find the color blue giving you a migraine for the next couple of days.”“Blue.” “Yeah. We don’t know why it happens, we just know it does. When it does, just look at something not blue for a while.” “You know the sky is blue, right?” “Yes. Stay indoors. Don’t look up.”“Unbelievable.”“Look, I don’t make it happen, I just give you the shots that make it happen. Finally, with this one”—Dr. Lee pointed to one of the last syringes in the longest tray—“in one in about two hundred fifty injections, the recipient feels the urge for, let’s just say, intense and homicidal violence. Like, ‘murder everyone in the building and build a pyre with their skulls’ level of violence.” “I can understand that,” I assured her. “No, you can’t,” she assured me back. “Fortunately, there’s a direct and accompanying side effect of extreme lassitude, which keeps most people from acting on the urge.” “So, like, ‘I want to kill you but that would mean leaving the couch.’” “Exactly,” Dr. Lee said. “We call it murder stoner syndrome.” “That can’t be real.” “It’s very real, my friend. We’ve learned that certain foods help counteract the murderous urge. If it happens to you and you actually have enough energy to stand up and move around, fry up some bacon or eat a pint of ice cream, or have a couple of slices of bread with butter.” “So, fatty foods.” “Basically.” “You remember the part where you told me to avoid fatty foods, right?” “I do.” “So, just to be clear, the choices here are ‘homicidal maniac’ or ‘shit tornado.’” “I wouldn’t put it that way, and yes. But the chances are pretty good you won’t experience either side effect, much less both at the same time.” “And if I do?” “Angrily consume your bacon on the toilet, is my advice.” Dr. Lee lifted the first syringe. “Ready?”————————Also posted on my blog.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693406-the-kaiju-preservation-society
Leviathan Falls;James S.A. Corey;2021;2020;528;4.54;57501;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Space', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'];The Laconian Empire has fallen, setting the thirteen hundred solar systems free from the rule of Winston Duarte. But the ancient enemy that killed the gate builders is awake, and the war against our universe has begun again. In the dead system of Adro, Elvi Okoye leads a desperate scientific mission to understand what the gate builders were and what destroyed them, even if it means compromising herself and the half-alien children who bear the weight of her investigation. Through the wide-flung systems of humanity, Colonel Aliana Tanaka hunts for Duarte’s missing daughter. . . and the shattered emperor himself. And on the Rocinante, James Holden and his crew struggle to build a future for humanity out of the shards and ruins of all that has come before. As nearly unimaginable forces prepare to annihilate all human life, Holden and a group of unlikely allies discover a last, desperate chance to unite all of humanity, with the promise of a vast galactic civilization free from wars, factions, lies, and secrets if they win. But the price of victory may be worse than the cost of defeat.;"4.5/5 starsMy last review of 2021 is for the conclusion to the first big space opera series of novels I’ve ever finished to its completion, and I’m glad it’s The Expanse.And so here we are, at the end of another long series. If you’ve been following my reading journey for a while, then you might realize that usually, the long series I finished are all epic fantasy series. This is why this review is a new milestone for me. Comprising of nine novels and multiple short stories and novellas, The Expanse by James S.A. Corey duo is the first big space opera series ever finished to its completion. Yes, this is the end, and it’s an emotional and satisfying conclusion. Endings are hard to nail, and the authors should be proud of this achievement.

“The love of a parent for their kid is the last thing to go.”

Leviathan Falls continue from where Tiamat’s Wrath left off. But in a way, it also felt like a beginning of a new self-contained installment. It’s the final volume in the series, and although I didn’t feel like I was bored with any of the pages written here, I also wondered whether the first half of the novel—mainly Tanaka’s hunting session—needed to be that long. Honestly speaking, the only reason why Leviathan Falls didn’t receive a full 5 stars rating from me is due to Tanaka’s POV in the first half of the novel. Tanaka, as far as I know, is a new POV character in the series. I don’t have any issue with her POV per se, but I also didn’t feel like her character felt necessary to explore. Or even exist. Tanaka is actually an interesting character, and it’s great to have her on the opposing side of the crew of the Rocinante. But with or without her, the progression and the final result of the series will still be the same. This is the only minor issue I had on the book, and thankfully, Corey more than made up for it in the second half of the novel.

“We also both know that when it comes to getting people to deny their own immediate needs in favor of a greater good, asking nicely almost never works.”

As you can guess, although I had a good time reading the book, a part of me was also worried. Can Corey actually deliver a satisfying conclusion to the series or not? And they succeeded marvelously by making sure, one last time, that the core of the narrative began and ended with the crew of the Rocinante. The crew of the Rocinante has always been the heart and soul of the series since Leviathan Wakes, and I’m gratified we receive a relatively large focus on them in this final volume. I’ll be lying if I say I didn’t feel emotional with the character’s development and ending. The crew has come so far from where they started. The level of understanding and trust they have with each other goes beyond words; they no longer need words to understand each other. And when words spoken from the bottom of their hearts do get exchanged, they felt sincere and poignant. There were several scenes in Leviathan Falls where I’m reminded of the journeys they faced in the previous eight books, and it really felt like I lived through those with them. Corey has done an excellent job in making sure that the characters—not just the crew of the Rocinante—remain at the center of the narrative throughout the entire series.

“Alex had heard the idea that a tool, used long enough and cared for well enough, developed a soul. He’d never been a religious man, but even without going to the supernatural, he felt like there was some truth in that.”

Unfortunately, this is where I must part ways with the review. Everything else belongs in the spoiler-realm. I will, however, say this. The title Leviathan Falls is not only a badass title that works as a contrast to the first book of the series: Leviathan Wakes; there’s a deeper meaning behind this title, and I hope you’ll get to find out for yourself. Leviathan Falls is an outstanding and bittersweet conclusion to The Expanse series, and the future of science fiction—novels or television shows—is brighter with this duo’s contribution in the genre. Bravo, James S.A. Corey.

‘“I absolutely believe that people are more good on balance than bad,” he said. “All the wars and all of the cruelty and all of the violence. I’m not looking away from any of that, and I still think there’s something beautiful about being what we are. History is soaked in blood. The future probably will be too. But for every atrocity, there’s a thousand small kindnesses that no one noticed. A hundred people who spent their lives loving and caring for each other. A few moments of real grace.”’

Loretta Thurwar and Hamara ""Hurricane Staxxx"" Stacker are the stars of Chain-Gang All-Stars, the cornerstone of CAPE, or Criminal Action Penal Entertainment, a highly-popular, highly-controversial, profit-raising program in America's increasingly dominant private prison industry. It's the return of the gladiators and prisoners are competing for the ultimate prize: their freedom.In CAPE, prisoners travel as Links in Chain-Gangs, competing in death-matches for packed arenas with righteous protestors at the gates. Thurwar and Staxxx, both teammates and lovers, are the fan favorites. And if all goes well, Thurwar will be free in just a few matches, a fact she carries as heavily as her lethal hammer. As she prepares to leave her fellow Links, she considers how she might help preserve their humanity, in defiance of these so-called games, but CAPE's corporate owners will stop at nothing to protect their status quo and the obstacles they lay in Thurwar's path have devastating consequences.Moving from the Links in the field to the protestors to the CAPE employees and beyond, Chain-Gang All-Stars is a kaleidoscopic, excoriating look at the American prison system's unholy alliance of systemic racism, unchecked capitalism, and mass incarceration, and a clear-eyed reckoning with what freedom in this country really means.";“suck my dick, america”;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61190770-chain-gang-all-stars

She proved herself one of the best starfighters in the human enclave of Detritus and she saved her people from extermination at the hands of the Krell—the enigmatic alien species that has been holding them captive for decades. What’s more, she traveled light-years from home as an undercover spy to infiltrate the Superiority, where she learned of the galaxy beyond her small, desolate planet home. Now, the Superiority—the governing galactic alliance bent on dominating all human life—has started a galaxy-wide war. And Spensa has seen the weapons they plan to use to end it: the Delvers. Ancient, mysterious alien forces that can wipe out entire planetary systems in an instant. Spensa knows that no matter how many pilots the DDF has, there is no defeating this predator. Except that Spensa is Cytonic. She faced down a Delver and saw something eerily familiar about it. And maybe, if she’s able to figure out what she is, she could be more than just another pilot in this unfolding war. She could save the galaxy. The only way she can discover what she really is, though, is to leave behind all she knows and enter the Nowhere. A place from which few ever return. To have courage means facing fear.

Starter Villain;John Scalzi;2023;2020;264;4.15;52580;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary', 'Adult'];Inheriting your uncle's supervillain business is more complicated than you might think. Particularly when you discover who's running the place.Charlie's life is going nowhere fast. A divorced substitute teacher living with his cat in a house his siblings want to sell, all he wants is to open a pub downtown, if only the bank will approve his loan.Then his long-lost uncle Jake dies and leaves his supervillain business (complete with island volcano lair) to Charlie.But becoming a supervillain isn't all giant laser death rays and lava pits. Jake had enemies, and now they're coming after Charlie. His uncle might have been a stand-up, old-fashioned kind of villain, but these are the real thing: rich, soulless predators backed by multinational corporations and venture capital.It's up to Charlie to win the war his uncle started against a league of supervillains. But with unionized dolphins, hyperintelligent talking spy cats, and a terrifying henchperson at his side, going bad is starting to look pretty good.In a dog-eat-dog world...be a cat.;"“I didn’t see the knife until the dude was just about to stab it into my uncle’s corpse.” 
If at your estranged billionaire uncle’s funeral not only there are wreaths with inscriptions of “You’re dead? LOL” but the mourners are trying to stab the body to make sure he’s indeed dead, you may want to ask a few questions.And maybe you’ll realize you just inherited a legit (so to say - “It’s mutual assured destruction, with a subscription fee”) business of being a villain to the supervillains.Too bad that up until now your experience included business journalism, substitute teaching, barely making ends meet while taking in cute stray cats. (Well, at least cats may help the supervillain image, but the rest, well…) “Instead I’m here on an island in the Caribbean, being told I need to talk to the dolphins in the middle of a labor action about some whales that might have torpedoes, armed by a secret society of villains who want access to a storeroom full of objects probably looted from the victims of the friggin’ Nazis and who are maybe willing to blow up my volcano lair to get it.”
———I adore John Scalzi. The thing is — yes, books like these are light and fun, and ridiculously entertaining, and will not be deep or profound or life-changing, and that is just perfect as far as I’m concerned. “Profound” in the current literary climate often means “depressingly bleak” and “will suck your lifeforce out through a tiny straw” — and Scalzi is the opposite of that, thank f*ck.If you love cats, you will adore this book. If, like me, you prefer cactus to cats, you still will love this. If you’re opposed to viewing dolphins as foul-mouthed cheeky bastards - well, then Scalzi’s humor may take a bit of getting used to.
“Williams shook his head. “Oh, no, Charlie. Don’t swim with the dolphins during a labor dispute. No matter how much they try to convince you otherwise.”
It’s funny, it’s adorable, it’s lightheartedly comfortable with an occasional infusion of semi-adolescent humor into snappy banter, and it just works very well. This is a book that doesn’t take itself too seriously and owns that.But then Scalzi still doesn’t forget that while billionaires have their allure, they typically haven’t become those just using merit and kindness. It’s a dickhead spectrum, and Scalzi lets you know where he stands.
 “I expected the members of Earth’s leading society of villains to be smarter,” I said.“I don’t know why.”“They’re smarter in movies and books.”“They would have to be, wouldn’t they?” Morrison said. “In the real world, they can be what people like them usually are: a bunch of dudes born into money who used that money to take advantage of other people to make even more money. It works great until they start believing that being rich makes them smart, and then they get in trouble. Unless they find someone else to take advantage of.”
Plus, it mentions umlauts. And sharks. And one can’t go wrong with those.4.5 stars.
“Still, death by shark is great on the resume,” Jacobs said.”

While they were on Earth, they caused confusion and destruction without ever lifting a finger. Well, that’s not exactly true. Part of their maelstrom was the sudden viral fame and untimely death of April May: a young woman who stumbled into Carl’s path, giving them their name, becoming their advocate, and putting herself in the middle of an avalanche of conspiracy theories.  Months later, the world is as confused as ever. Andy has picked up April’s mantle of fame, speaking at conferences and online about the world post-Carl; Maya, ravaged by grief, begins to follow a string of mysteries that she is convinced will lead her to April; and Miranda infiltrates a new scientific operation . . . one that might have repercussions beyond anyone’s comprehension. As they each get further down their own paths, a series of clues arrive—mysterious books that seem to predict the future and control the actions of their readers; unexplained internet outages; and more—which seem to suggest April may be very much alive. In the midst of the gang's possible reunion is a growing force, something that wants to capture our consciousness and even control our reality. A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor is the bold and brilliant follow-up to An Absolutely Remarkable Thing. It’s a fast-paced adventure that is also a biting social commentary, asking hard, urgent questions. How will we live online? What powers over our lives are we giving away for free? Who has the right to change the world forever? And how do we find comfort in an increasingly isolated world?";Okay - um? One of the best sequels ever? How was this NOT written during the pandemic! The themes are so relevant to so many societal thoughts today. If you've read the first one, you're gonna want to read this ASAP.

The Ministry of Time;Kaliane Bradley;2024;2020;341;3.62;49019;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Time Travel', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Audiobook'];A time travel romance, a spy thriller, a workplace comedy, and an ingenious exploration of the nature of power and the potential for love to change it all: In the near future, a civil servant is offered the salary of her dreams and is, shortly afterward, told what project she’ll be working on. A recently established government ministry is gathering “expats” from across history to establish whether time travel is feasible—for the body, but also for the fabric of space-time.She is tasked with working as a “bridge”: living with, assisting, and monitoring the expat known as “1847” or Commander Graham Gore. As far as history is concerned, Commander Gore died on Sir John Franklin’s doomed 1845 expedition to the Arctic, so he’s a little disoriented to be living with an unmarried woman who regularly shows her calves, surrounded by outlandish concepts such as “washing machines,” “Spotify,” and “the collapse of the British Empire.” But with an appetite for discovery, a seven-a-day cigarette habit, and the support of a charming and chaotic cast of fellow expats, he soon adjusts.Over the next year, what the bridge initially thought would be, at best, a horrifically uncomfortable roommate dynamic, evolves into something much deeper. By the time the true shape of the Ministry’s project comes to light, the bridge has fallen haphazardly, fervently in love, with consequences she never could have imagined. Forced to confront the choices that brought them together, the bridge must finally reckon with how—and whether she believes—what she does next can change the future.;"Originally posted here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I loved this book. It was funny, charming, sad and clever... but the overwhelming feeling I’m experiencing as I sit down to write this review is anger. Anger at all the people who rated this book 1 star and screamed ""plagiarism"" after reading a title and blurb, and anger at all the mindless sheep who rushed to copy them. I'm trying to stay calm and collected, but I confess I'm furious about what has happened here. Bradley has been hounded on twitter for a baseless accusation and had people spam-rating her not-yet-published book on Goodreads. This is not okay, guys.I will fight to the death for your right to say if you think a book is crap. I say it all the time. But plagiarism is a serious accusation that can ruin an author’s career. I’d hope someone throwing it around would do the bare minimum… like actually reading the book. It is obvious no one here has done that because this book is so dissimilar to El ministerio del tiempo-- a Spanish TV series about time travel (it's fun, I recommend)-- in plot and overall tone that the accusation is laughable.Anything more than a cursory glance would make it obvious that the two are not similar at all. This is a funny and charming love story between a biracial British-Cambodian translator and Commander Graham Gore who was part of the failed Franklin expedition to the Arctic. El ministerio del tiempo is a historical adventure series in which the main characters journey back to many different time periods to deal with incidents caused by time travel and ensure no one uses time doors to change history. In The Ministry of Time, we don't see any characters travelling back in time.I don’t know what the complainers think has been plagiarised here. They fixate on the title (El ministerio del tiempo means The Ministry of Time in Spanish) but titles are not protected by copyright*. Neither is the concept of time travel, which— I gotta tell you —Javier and Pablo Olivares did not invent. They did not even invent the concept of a government agency dealing with time travel. The TV series Seven Days (1998-2001) follows a secret branch of the NSA which has developed time travelling technology. The movie Timecop (1994) sees the creation of the Time Enforcement Commission to police the threat of time travel. The premises of both of these are far more similar to El ministerio del tiempo than this book and they predate it by about twenty years.Then in 2017, two years after the first airing of El ministerio del tiempo, Neal Stephenson published his The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O., in which the Department of Diachronic Operations uses time travel to benefit the US government. But I guess it’s okay when white men write about time travel.I've seen some people actually trying to frame the argument against this book as being about Big Bad Britain being their good ol' imperialist selves and stealing from other nations! Guys, this is SO FUCKING IRONIC it's almost funny. Because if those people had actually read this book they would know that it's a book by a British-Cambodian writer in which a British-Cambodian woman explores themes of colonialism/postcolonialism.
So far as I understood the British Empire, other people’s countries were useful or negligible but rarely conceived of as autonomous.
*Takes deep calming breaths*It's annoying that I can't just gush about how much I enjoyed this book. It deserves a review that isn't all me screaming onto my keyboard. I'll try to do that now.Time travel and government drama are the backdrop here to some truly marvellous characters. Imagine what you would get if you put a near-future British-Cambodian woman and a man who was raised at the height of empire together in a house. It makes for many scenes of hilarity and important conversations about the changes that have taken place. The dynamic between the MC and Graham is just delightful.
“You’re a musician. How can you have no sense of time-keeping?”“You are a larger instrument than a flute.”“I bet you say that to all the girls.”
It is primarily an introspective novel and slow-burn romance, at least until the last 25% or so, but the scenes are driven by dialogue so the pacing doesn't lag. Bradley explores themes of colonialism, slavery, language, being mixed-race, being white passing, exoticization of other cultures, and inherited trauma. The MC carries the inherited trauma of the Cambodian genocide with her and it sneaks into her everyday life and thoughts in unexpected ways.I adored the secondary characters, too, especially Margaret. It is rare to find a book that is equal parts entertaining AND contains so many important messages. I thought I wanted more from the ending but, having sat with my thoughts a while, I think it was a good example of an author finding that sweet spot of wanting more before it tips over into too much. And the last part of the book is written so beautifully I wanted to quote it, but I won't do that to you.*I love how some are claiming the title is too weirdly specific to be coincidence when it's not specific at all. It’s actually very generic. Countries have used the title “Ministry of…” throughout history, and the UK still uses it for the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Justice. If someone tasked me with coming up with a name for a government department dealing with time travel, I wouldn’t need to dig into Spanish television to arrive at ""The Ministry of Time.""";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199798179-the-ministry-of-time

The Space Between Worlds;Micaiah Johnson;2020;2020;336;3.94;39857;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Fantasy', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'Lesbian'];An outsider who can travel between worlds discovers a secret that threatens her new home and her fragile place in it, in a stunning sci-fi debut that’s both a cross-dimensional adventure and a powerful examination of identity, privilege, and belonging.Multiverse travel is finally possible, but there’s just one catch: No one can visit a world where their counterpart is still alive. Enter Cara, whose parallel selves happen to be exceptionally good at dying—from disease, turf wars, or vendettas they couldn’t outrun. Cara’s life has been cut short on 372 worlds in total.On this Earth, however, Cara has survived. Identified as an outlier and therefore a perfect candidate for multiverse travel, Cara is plucked from the dirt of the wastelands. Now she has a nice apartment on the lower levels of the wealthy and walled-off Wiley City. She works—and shamelessly flirts—with her enticing yet aloof handler, Dell, as the two women collect off-world data for the Eldridge Institute. She even occasionally leaves the city to visit her family in the wastes, though she struggles to feel at home in either place. So long as she can keep her head down and avoid trouble, Cara is on a sure path to citizenship and security.But trouble finds Cara when one of her eight remaining doppelgängers dies under mysterious circumstances, plunging her into a new world with an old secret. What she discovers will connect her past and her future in ways she could have never imagined—and reveal her own role in a plot that endangers not just her world, but the entire multiverse.;"“Have you encountered any others who have truly met themselves?” This line from Carmen Maria Machado’s short-story collection Her Body and Other Parties stuck in my mind like a dart the first time I read it, and while I was reading The Space Between Worlds it resurfaced again, ringing in my ears so clearly.Imagine peering into a mirror, blinking out through familiar eyes, and seeing another life reflected back at you, both knowable and utterly beyond your grasp. You’re looking at a person from a world crafted from choices you had not made, paths you had not followed. This person who is almost you but not quite, not all the way. If you reached for yourself, would you recognize your own topography? Or will you always measure the distance between the person you would have been and the person you have become? More important, would you throw yourself into your reflection in the hopes of forgetting who you are? For Cara, the protagonist of Johnson’s feverishly inventive and star-bright debut, the answer is easy as breathing: yes.
“You do this a lot?”“It’s kind of my special gift.”“World hopping?”I swallow. “Dying.”
The Space Between Worlds is a novel that gathers one of science fiction’s oldest and most enduring tales (alternate worlds, stacked beside ours like sheets of paper, and the people who can dip like hummingbirds from one to another), puts an intricate, clever spin on it (you can’t travel to a parallel universe where your doppelgänger is still alive without great cost) and wrings it for all the thematic and emotional gravity it can get.From the very first page, The Space Between Worlds takes firm hold and doesn’t let go. Science fiction novels typically have to marshal a wealth of information in order to explain the workings of new unfamiliar concepts and theory, to peel back the layers of the author’s world and fire up the reader’s imagination, but The Space Between Worlds skims along without becoming mired in leaden exposition. The remarkable elements of Johnson’s world come readily, completely. The novel explains what it needs to, when it needs to be said. The author puts all the pieces in place, ushering readers into her story with ample clarity and narrative precision, and it is such a thrill to watch the gears of the story turn once they’re set in motion.The details of Cara’s character, however, don’t yield as easily. They instead emerge drip by drip throughout the story, as if from the tip of a pipette. You get the sense that something essential is shielded—the depths of her and the secrets she cast before her, vast as her own shadow—and is being released in small bursts until it becomes a flood. And looking at this flood, at the wreckage of this woman, I wanted, desperately, to understand what, who, had wrecked her.Fortunately, Johnson has an impeccable eye for exploring emotional wreckage. Cara’s character is accessible, understandable in all the ways that she is wounded, angry, scared—and flawed. And the slow, grim unwinding of her character makes for the novel’s most hard-hitting and rewarding experience.The Space Between Worlds is a novel that acknowledges trauma and its terrible volume. How it roils and cracks, beats in your blood like drumming under the ground, a sound to crack open the world. Like Cara, many of us carry our traumas, dragging them behind like shackles on both ankles, much further than we imagined we would. We think if we put up enough walls around them, or bury them in a tomb, shoved down deep where the sun can’t reach them, if we stay in the shallows, they’d be where we’d left them. But then, inevitably, the low, steady thrum of the past starts bubbling to the surface. And then it erupts. Cara has refined burying the past, practiced it like a high art: she smiled through teeth to hide the grimace, donned masks until they felt like her face, and kept secrets until the lies ate away at her like moths in cloth. It was a regular habit, as vital and unconscious to her as breathing. When you’ve been raised around monsters, and knew the color of your blood, the innate need to self-preserve becomes this dwarfing, all-consuming, all-devouring thing. A thing with weight and press, and it’s weight and press that Cara felt as though it were on her shoulders. Cara learned self-preservation before she could learn regret. She measured her capacity for enduring pain to the precise outer edge of its limits, and knew the difference between happiness and shivering alone in the shadows. In hundreds of worlds, Cara lives with her back to the wall, ruled by fear of death, but in the world she escapes to, she survives in mockery of everything that should have destroyed her. And it’s easier to survive when you move through life with one foot placed in front of the other as if walking on a tightrope. It’s easier still to do it on your own, without close friendships—let alone intimate relationships.But people have a way of dipping around Cara’s guard, of scrabbling at her armor, including Dell, Cara’s supervisor. In another version of Cara’s world, Cara’s relationship with Dell may have had the opportunity to be based on more than the resentful, grudging necessity of co-workers who navigate around each other like ships and icebergs. In another version of Cara’s world, Dell wasn’t too afraid of where Cara came from to want her, and Cara wasn’t too afraid that Dell would disappear into the dark pit that is Cara’s past to confront her about it. In this world, their moments together are drenched with a bruised, unthwarted longing, filled with endless distances.There’s a deep, wounded familiarity to Cara’s journey that snagged in my heart, like cloth caught in a branch: the nagging sense that you’ve been looking at the world through a breath-fogged mirror, and that if you were to wipe away the condensation and look at yourself—at this clear and cold reflection of your truest self—you would be utterly horrified by what you saw. That you haven’t truly met yourself, and that you wouldn’t want to—especially in the dark.
They say hunting monsters will turn you into one. That isn’t what’s happening now. Sometimes to kill a dragon, you have to remember that you breathe fire too. This isn’t a becoming; it’s a revealing. I’ve been a monster all along. 
But The Space Between Worlds isn’t a gray, dreary afternoon of a book. Colors and detail start to fill in like paint soaking into paper when kindness and wisdom and love, always flickering through the pages, begin to simmer together, like bubbles in a cauldron. Johnson acknowledges that we are more than the worst things we’ve done, and we are more than the worst things that have been done to us. We are defined by more than our pasts, or our traumas—we are the flowing scripts we use to imagine for ourselves new scrolls, flapping defiantly behind us like wings. New tomorrows, new beginnings. Ultimately, the novel’s biggest gift is that it never loses sight of the human emotions at its core, and that the author never once forgets that everyone aches.Along the way, the author also ponders, frames, and interrogates large philosophical and ethical questions, which only intensifies the story’s emotional wallop: about racism and xenophobia and how they’ve always had a fluid relationship with capitalism, about science and how it can be weaponized by those who have a vested interest in sustaining a system that keeps people marching dully along the same, mechanistic lines, and about humanity and our place in the metaphysical clockwork of existence. But for all its thematic gravity, The Space Between Worlds is a lot of fun too. It’s a story that gutted me and buoyed me. An excellent novel with a gripping plot, tenderly rendered characters, and plenty to think about long after it’s over. Whatever Johnson decides to write after this, she has a fan for life!
It is only one world in infinite universes where this impossible happiness exists, but that is what makes it so valuable.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43301353-the-space-between-worlds

The only thing it has going for it is a chance proximity to more popular worlds, making it a decent stopover for ships traveling between the wormholes that keep the Galactic Commons connected. If deep space is a highway, Gora is just your average truck stop.At the Five-Hop One-Stop, long-haul spacers can stretch their legs (if they have legs, that is), and get fuel, transit permits, and assorted supplies. The Five-Hop is run by an enterprising alien and her sometimes helpful child, who work hard to provide a little piece of home to everyone passing through.When a freak technological failure halts all traffic to and from Gora, three strangers—all different species with different aims—are thrown together at the Five-Hop. Grounded, with nothing to do but wait, the trio—an exiled artist with an appointment to keep, a cargo runner at a personal crossroads, and a mysterious individual doing her best to help those on the fringes—are compelled to confront where they’ve been, where they might go, and what they are, or could be, to each other.;Extraordinary.This is virtually plotless. It's about a small group of people from different species who happen to be at the same interstellar truck stop when a tech failure leaves them all stranded for a few days. They talk. they eat. They come together in an emergency. There is no enemy. Not much actually happens. I couldn't stop reading and I was sobbing like a child at the end.Because this is about how people are different and strange to one another, and how hard it is to communicate and share experiences and principles with people who don't share them, but also how important it is and how much it means. It's about people reaching out and making contacts that matter, and making a difference to how they think as a result. It is exactly the book everyone should be reading right now in these horrible polarised hateful times because it's a reminder of what we could achieve, and the small scale of the story doesn't disguise the huge importance of what it strives for.I'm crying again writing this.

The Ministry for the Future;Kim Stanley Robinson;2020;2020;563;3.88;34389;no;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Climate Change', 'Environment', 'Audiobook', 'Politics', 'Speculative Fiction'];Established in 2025, the purpose of the new organization was simple: To advocate for the world's future generations and to protect all living creatures, present and future. It soon became known as the Ministry for the Future, and this is its story. From legendary science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson comes a vision of climate change unlike any ever imagined. Told entirely through fictional eye-witness accounts, The Ministry for the Future is a masterpiece of the imagination, the story of how climate change will affect us all over the decades to come. Its setting is not a desolate, post-apocalyptic world, but a future that is almost upon us—and in which we might just overcome the extraordinary challenges we face. It is a novel both immediate and impactful, desperate and hopeful in equal measure, and it is one of the most powerful and original books on climate change ever written.;"A short guide on how to enjoy reading The Ministry for the Future:1. Be aware that it occupies a peculiar spot between fiction and non-fiction. The book features individuals, it even drives home a powerful point about individual engagement, but it is not focused on personal stories. While some chapters do go on at length about personal trauma, others are literally meeting minutes. Reams of fictional near-future history. Details on geoengineering techniques. The infamous infodump. If it is an aquired taste, it's a taste well worth aquiring.2. Do not expect a scientifically rigid proposal for solving the climate crisis. KSR is an amazingly informed and engaged author and there are a number of intriguing and well-researched ideas in this book, touching on geoengineering, policy work, economics and more. Some might even work - while others would be picked apart by a domain expert. Personally I err on the hopeful side, plus they're fun to read. However, that doesn't really matter. Whatever its ultimate realism, the book fosters an understanding that solutions (plural) to climate change and global inequity are possible, that they can be imagined, that--look--this could be one way it plays out, however unlikely, that, yes, there are unknowns, but we can't really afford to let that paralyze us.3. Do not mistake it for a dystopian novel. It starts out sobering, then proceeds with a grim determination that turns into determined hopefulness. Not utopian either; there's no starry eyed insistence on the ensured triumph of rationality and enlightenment (and if such is possible, it will be hard-earned). But despite the cautionary mention that humans usually believe they will be alright all the way to the end, KSR ultimately commits to optimism.4. Do consider it a rallying cry. One among the many-but-not-yet-enough. I hope it finds its target in spite of considerable cynicism.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50998056-the-ministry-for-the-future

The only daughter of either a genius, or a madman. Montgomery Laughton: a melancholic overseer with a tragic past and a propensity for alcohol. An outcast who assists Dr. Moreau with his scientific experiments, which are financed by the Lizaldes, owners of magnificent haciendas and plentiful coffers.

Some light romance threads through the heavier ethical questions concerning humanity.”—Library Journal (starred review)Q&AIs this a sequel or a prequel?Neither, it's not a pastiche either. It has a similar setup of a reclusive scientist conducting questionable experiments, and explores some of the same themes of the original (religion, science, power, and morality) while also discussing concerns Wells never tackles (colonialism, class, womanhood). What genre is this? The original was horror, right?I call it science fiction and historical. The thing is, Wells wrote 'scientific romances.' Basically science fiction didn't exist as a category, but neither did horror. But scientific romance sounds weird nowadays and has a different connotation. It's definitely not a horror novel but I can't stop people from tagging it whichever way they want. Just a warning that if you expect gore, you shouldn't. How did Wells make his creatures? How are your creatures made?Dr. Moreau in the original uses vivisection, basically slicing animals apart, to make animals that behave like humans. Also conditioning. Vivisection was a huge concern around that time and it's when we first get into questions of ethics of using animals in experiments. In my novel, Moreau is not a vivisectionist. He probably figured out CRISPR technology more than a hundred years before anyone else. Where is the novel set?Mexico, in the southern peninsula of Yucatan which was isolated from the rest of the country and therefore sometimes portrayed as an island.Is your book set in the same time period as the original?Roughly the same time period. The events in ""Island"" are supposed to take place around 1887 and my book has the bulk of the action in 1877. Should I read the original? You don't need to but I like reading 19th century literature.

The Ferryman;Justin Cronin;2023;2020;538;3.93;33025;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Thriller', 'Mystery'];"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Passage comes a riveting standalone novel about a group of survivors on a hidden island utopia--where the truth isn't what it seems.Founded by a mysterious genius, the archipelago of Prospera lies hidden from the horrors of a deteriorating outside world. In this island paradise, Prospera's lucky citizens enjoy long, fulfilling lives until the monitors embedded in their forearms, meant to measure their physical health and psychological well-being, fall below 10 percent. Then they retire themselves, embarking on a ferry ride to the island known as the Nursery, where their failing bodies are renewed, their memories are wiped clean, and they are readied to restart life afresh.Proctor Bennett, of the Department of Social Contracts, has a satisfying career as a ferryman, gently shepherding people through the retirement process--and, when necessary, enforcing it. But all is not well with Proctor. For one thing, he's been dreaming--which is supposed to be impossible in Prospera. For another, his monitor percentage has begun to drop alarmingly fast. And then comes the day he is summoned to retire his own father, who gives him a disturbing and cryptic message before being wrestled onto the ferry.Meanwhile, something is stirring. The Support Staff, ordinary men and women who provide the labor to keep Prospera running, have begun to question their place in the social order. Unrest is building, and there are rumors spreading of a resistance group--known as ""Arrivalists""--who may be fomenting revolution.Soon Proctor finds himself questioning everything he once believed, entangled with a much bigger cause than he realized--and on a desperate mission to uncover the truth.";"Justin Cronin's books have the same side effects as Blake Crouch's sci-fi novels: once you finish them, your brain cells feel like they've run a marathon, leaving you pleasantly exhausted and in awe of the journey you've experienced.This exceptional novel deserves more than just five stars! It's a mind-bending, intelligent, complex, and challenging read that combines the best elements of Westworld and Inception.Although it's a lengthy book, you'll find yourself never wanting it to end. Each chapter is a treat to savor, like slowly indulging in a delectable feast while your grey cells emit a delightful smoke.The last quarter of the book delivers a shocking twist that will leave you breathless. Personally, I enjoyed the first third slightly more, but the big revelation in the final section was necessary to tie everything together and provide a deeper understanding.Without revealing too much, let me summarize the main plot:The story takes place in Prospera, an archipelago state hidden from the world, enjoying a splendid isolation. The climate is idyllic, with warm sunshine, cooling ocean breezes, and gentle rains. Prospera consists of three islands. The first is the main island, covering 482 square miles, where the privileged residents reside. The second island, known as the Annex, is home to the support staff with lesser biological and social endowments. The third island, Nursery Isle, or simply the Nursery, is a fortified sanctuary protected by treacherous shoals and towering cliffs.Prosperans dedicate themselves to lofty aspirations, focusing on creative expression and the pursuit of personal excellence. Leaving Prospera is strictly forbidden, as knowledge of their existence could jeopardize everything. After all, who would desire to leave such a utopian place?Our main character is Proctor Bennett, the director for District Six of the Department of Social Contracts, Enforcement Division, known as the ""Ferryman."" His role is to accompany emotionally distressed elderly citizens to the ferry that will take them to the Nursery, where their memories will be erased, granting them a second chance at life.Every aspect of life in Prospera is governed by contracts, including marriages. Proctor is married to Elise, a brilliant fashion designer, through a contract that spans fifteen years. Elise is also the daughter of Madam Chair, the head of the organization.Proctor's life and contentment are shattered when he is assigned to assist his estranged father to the ferry. Their relationship has been strained since his guardian mother's tragic suicide. Confronted with his father's presence, Proctor's old wounds reopen. To his dismay, the accompanying process takes an unexpected turn when his father experiences a delusional episode, questioning the reality of their world and screaming a name, ""Oranios""!

Light from Uncommon Stars;Ryka Aoki;2021;2020;372;4.06;32343;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'Lesbian'];A defiantly joyful adventure set in California's San Gabriel Valley, with cursed violins, Faustian bargains, and queer alien courtship over fresh-made donuts.Shizuka Satomi made a deal with the to escape damnation, she must entice seven other violin prodigies to trade their souls for success. She has already delivered six. When Katrina Nguyen, a young transgender runaway, catches Shizuka's ear with her wild talent, Shizuka can almost feel the curse lifting. She's found her final candidate. But in a donut shop off a bustling highway in the San Gabriel Valley, Shizuka meets Lan Tran, retired starship captain, interstellar refugee, and mother of four. Shizuka doesn't have time for crushes or coffee dates, what with her very soul on the line, but Lan's kind smile and eyes like stars might just redefine a soul's worth. And maybe something as small as a warm donut is powerful enough to break a curse as vast as the California coastline. As the lives of these three women become entangled by chance and fate, a story of magic, identity, curses, and hope begins, and a family worth crossing the universe for is found.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.;When was the last time I read a book this mind-blowingly original? Light from Uncommon Stars takes elements of different familiar story lines -- a deal with the Devil, aliens from outer space living among us, and the all-too-real struggles of a young trans woman trying to survive abuse and rejection -- and combines them into something completely new, jarring, unexpected and beautiful, much like the Bartók sonata around which the plot revolves. Shizuka Satomi, once a brilliant violinist, now a feared and legendary violin teacher known as the Queen of Hell, has traded her soul to the Devil, but she has an escape clause: If she can deliver the souls of seven of her best students to her demon-in-charge Tremon Phillipe, Shizuka herself will be able to walk free. She has already delivered six souls. And now she thinks she has found the seventh . . .Katrina Nguyen can no longer stand it at home. Her father gets drunk and hits her and her mother. Neither parent can accept the fact that Katrina is transgender. She scrapes together money for her hormonal treatments by doing porn chats online, putting up with 'clients' that call her a freak but also find her alluring, but what Katrina really wants is to play her violin to create beautiful music based on video game soundtracks. She's just afraid. If anyone sees her, will they accept her violin playing, or will they only see her appearance and hurl more hateful comments? Finally, Katrina takes her 'go bag' and escapes, riding the bus to L.A. to find someone she met once, who seemed supportive . . . She never dreams that she is about to find a teacher instead.Lan Tran has brought her family to earth to escape the Endplague which is slowly destroying her home in the Galactic Empire. Disguised as human, the Tran family takes over Starrgate Donut and begins to find a place in their local community. Lan's mission is to build an actual star gate inside the giant donut sign on top of their shop, but when she meets an elegant woman who barges into the donut shop, desperate to use the restroom, the first glimmers of an impossible intergalactic romance begin to shine.Can Shizuka and Lan find love amidst the twin threats of galactic plague and demonic contracts? Will Katrina really agree to trade her soul to realize her dreams? There are so many memorable characters in this novel. You will care about each and every one, beautifully rendered and fully human. It's a story about escaping your fate, making your place in a hostile world, and learning to find love among those who accept you. It's funny, heartfelt, haunting. It's also a quick read, because Aoki's chapters are real page turners! Highly recommended.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56179360-light-from-uncommon-stars

Light of the Jedi;Charles Soule;2021;2020;380;3.93;29325;yes;['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Novels'];Long before the First Order, before the Empire, before the Clone Wars...Jedi lit the way for the galaxy in the High Republic.It is a golden age. Intrepid hyperspace scouts expand the reach of the Republic to the farthest stars, worlds flourish under the benevolent leadership of the Senate, and peace reigns, enforced by the wisdom and strength of the renowned order of Force users known as the Jedi. With the Jedi at the height of their power, the free citizens of the galaxy are confident in their ability to weather any storm. But even the brightest light can cast a shadow, and some storms defy any preparation.When a shocking catastrophe in hyperspace tears a ship to pieces, the flurry of shrapnel emerging from the disaster threatens an entire system. No sooner does the call for help go out than the Jedi race to the scene. The scope of the emergence, however, is enough to push even Jedi to their limit. As the sky breaks open and destruction rains down upon the peaceful alliance they helped to build, the Jedi must trust in the Force to see them through a day in which a single mistake could cost billions of lives.Even as the Jedi battle valiantly against calamity, something truly deadly grows beyond the boundary of the Republic. The hyperspace disaster is far more sinister than the Jedi could ever suspect. A threat hides in the darkness, far from the light of the age, and harbors a secret that could strike fear into even a Jedi's heart.;"WE ARE ALL THE REPUBLICCharles Soule first came to prominence as a comics writer, including some Star Wars titles such as the extremely well received Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith series but, as proven by his excellent The Oracle Year, prose novels are equally within his wheelhouse.As the leadoff (adult) novel of Lucasfilm's High Republic publishing initiative he had a lot of responsibility with this one, both to the readers and his fellow Project Luminous authors, and he delivered in a major way.Giddy up, my young padawan!The characters? Quirky, well-defined and memorable. The settings? Mostly original and well-developed. The action sequences? Thrilling. The do? Derring.But what I most wanted to talk about in this review is the point on which most tales from a Galaxy Far, Far Away live or die: the villains.Enter the NihilThese Mad Max looking lunatics are the depraved flipside of the Galactic Republic: reavers, killers, pirates and wholesale hedonists who exist in the (metaphorical) shadows cast by initiatives like the Republic's Starlight Beacon space station in the Outer Rim, meant to bring unity, progress and fellow-feeling among the more rugged planets of that area of space. Their leaders are just reflections of this canny wantonness: they seek not to rule the Galaxy but to prey upon it at their whim. At least, almost all of them.Beware the gaze of the EyeI don't want to get too much into Marchion Ro for fear of spoiling what he's all about, but trust me when I say that Soule has added a wholly original, unpredictable and downright fiendish Big Bad into the Canon, which at this point can not be an easy feat. I can't wait to see what he does with the character next, and what his actions and their repercussions will mean for the characters throughout the High Republic books to come.TL;DR: A fantastic Space Opera in conversation with the Star Wars we know and love but boldly telling original stories, and I have a feeling the best is yet to come.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51637946-light-of-the-jedi
The Last Emperox;John Scalzi;2020;2020;320;4.13;28792;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Fantasy'];The collapse of The Flow, the interstellar pathway between the planets of the Interdependency, has accelerated. Entire star systems—and billions of people—are becoming cut off from the rest of human civilization. This collapse was foretold through scientific prediction… and yet, even as the evidence is obvious and insurmountable, many still try to rationalize, delay and profit from, these final days of one of the greatest empires humanity has ever known. Emperox Grayland II has finally wrested control of her empire from those who oppose her and who deny the reality of this collapse. But “control” is a slippery thing, and even as Grayland strives to save as many of her people from impoverished isolation, the forces opposing her rule will make a final, desperate push to topple her from her throne and power, by any means necessary. Grayland and her thinning list of allies must use every tool at their disposal to save themselves, and all of humanity. And yet it may not be enough. Will Grayland become the savior of her civilization… or the last emperox to wear the crown?;This was such a satisfying end to this trilogy and the strongest book in the series. There is, as with the other two books in this series, an over-reliance on expository narrative devices to tell too much of the story but it's just such a fun, sexy read with interesting characters and a big, operatic plot, and some really unexpected twists that really surprised me and had me on the edge of my seat turning the pages as fast as I could. Highly recommend this trilogy.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38322550-the-last-emperox

With nothing to lose and no desire to return to Earth, Claire and her team decide to investigate.What they find at the other end of the signal is a shock: the Aurora, a famous luxury space-liner that vanished on its maiden tour of the solar system more than twenty years ago. A salvage claim like this could set Claire and her crew up for life. But a quick trip through the Aurora reveals something isn’t right.Whispers in the dark. Flickers of movement. Words scrawled in blood. Claire must fight to hold onto her sanity and find out what really happened on the Aurora, before she and her crew meet the same ghastly fate.;"**4.5-stars**Claire Kovalik, and her crew of communication beacon repair specialists, are out at the very edge of the system on their final mission together, when they pick up an odd distress signal coming from outside of 'civilized' space.They're surprised to find that the signal is being sent from the famous luxury liner, Aurora, missing since its maiden voyage more than 20-years ago.Without much to lose, they collectively decide to investigate. After all, being able to make a salvage claim on such a luxurious and famous ship could literally change all of their lives for the better. Maybe Claire would finally be able to start her own business. She needs this.Admittedly, it's dangerous. A huge risk, but no risk, no reward. Boarding the ship, it quickly becomes evident that something had gone horribly wrong aboard the Aurora. Trying to piece it all together, while also trying to figure out how best to prove their claim, Claire and her crew struggle. It's hard to determine what is real and what is not. They are hearing things, seeing things; it is disturbing to say the least.Some major decisions need to be made. They need to get out of there, but is the Aurora herself sabotaging them?Y'all, I had so much fun reading Dead Silence. I definitely recommend it to any SF Horror fans. Barnes dealt up everything that was promised in the publisher's synopsis. We love to see it. The comp to Titanic and The Shining is quite apt. I especially loved the Titanic influence. The way the ship was described, as well as the composition of the original passengers. I could just picture Jack and Rose gracing the beautiful main ballroom. The wealth and opulence on full display, just a staircase or two away from the working class.This story definitely got under my skin. It's cold and dark. There are unexplained things happening. As the characters began to panic, I felt my own heart rate rising as well.It felt claustrophobic, like there was no safe way out. This is the perfect example of why I would never choose to go to space. Decisions there are so final. One wrong move and it is literally the end of your life. There's no second chances.The end got a little wild, with the action definitely increasing in the second half. At the end of the day though, I can't imagine this story going any other way.It was great. Really well imagined and brought to the page. I look forward to reading more from this author.Thank you so much to the publisher, Tor Nightfire, for providing me with a copy to read and review. This story is going to stick with me for a long time!!";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693184-dead-silence

Shards of Earth;Adrian Tchaikovsky;2021;2020;0;4.19;25623;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Space', 'Aliens'];The Arthur C. Clarke award-winning author of Children of Time brings us an extraordinary space opera about humanity on the brink of extinction, and how one man's discovery will save or destroy us all.The war is over. Its heroes forgotten. Until one chance discovery . . .Idris has neither aged nor slept since they remade him in the war. And one of humanity's heroes now scrapes by on a freelance salvage vessel, to avoid the attention of greater powers.After earth was destroyed, mankind created a fighting elite to save their species, enhanced humans such as Idris. In the silence of space they could communicate, mind-to-mind, with the enemy. Then their alien aggressors, the Architects, simply disappeared—and Idris and his kind became obsolete.Now, fifty years later, Idris and his crew have discovered something strange abandoned in space. It's clearly the work of the Architects—but are they returning? And if so, why? Hunted by gangsters, cults and governments, Idris and his crew race across the galaxy hunting for answers. For they now possess something of incalculable value, that many would kill to obtain.;"Sooner or later, Adrian Tchaikovsky is going to make me learn to spell his name. His output rivals Sanderson's, but his willingness to explore more worlds, without the same meticulous detail that tends to bog down other authors, makes him fascinating to me. Children of Time was one of my favorite books of 2020, and while Shards of Earth doesn't rival it, I found it  compelling. An exceptionally long 'Prologue' is the lynchpin between two characters that we will follow the rest of the book. It begins: ""In the seventy-eighth year of the war, an Architect came to Berlenhof."" Tchaikovsky is generally of the immersion school of sci-fi; he will give you the details, but you need to assemble the pieces, and the Prologue is no exception. There's a lot of ideas dropped here, but the main one is that the unfightable and unknowable Architects are remodeling life as they encounter it, and to date, no one has been able to establish contact. This moment in time will be pivotal, and both Solace and Idris Telemmier will play major roles. Solace is a soldier in the Heaven's Sword Sorority, ""the Parthenon. Humans, for a given value of human. The engineered warrior women who had been the Colonies' shield ever since the fall of Earth."" Idris is a Colonial and part of the newest 'weapon' deployed against the Architects.The Prologue is a meaty piece of sci-fi, and I confess, after investing in it, I wanted it to continue. It was a version of The Expanse, tv show), space battle style, with human players against crushing odds in a complicated and only partially understood universe. Unfortunately, as the Prologue ends we get foreshadowing that the investment in world-building is about to pay uncertain dividends: ""Thirty-nine years after that, they woke Solace from cold storage one more time and said her warrior skills were needed."" Thus the epic space battle turns into a new book, that of a contentious crew of salvagers caught up in galactic events.If you've followed me more than a few minutes, you know I've been on a sci-fi binge, and the crew-of-misfits in space seems to be one that I gravitate to. Between The Expanse (the show!!) and Suzanne Palmer's Finder series, I've been enjoying the outer reaches of the galaxy, at least after humanity has solved that pesky distance-spanning/lifespan issue. So when I say the rest of the story felt largely familiar, I'm not meaning any insult--it's a subgenre I like. I did hope that Tchaikovsky would bring some of his particular ingenuity, specifically aliens and lifeforms that felt alien, to his version of misfits-in-space. Sadly, it was only near the end where I felt a little bit of that mental frission when I encounter something unique. The odd-ball crew of seven contains two alien lifeforms and members of humanity from different Colonies, giving a glimpse into potential alien and cultural weirdness, particularly with Kittering, ""a crab-like alien,"" and Medvig, ""an intelligence distributed across a knot of cyborg roaches."" Unfortunately, Tchaikovsky is willing to break genre rules about red-shirts, which means that the reader may reach out and connect with the different characters, but that experience may be cut short. Considering that this is the first book in what is presumably a series/trilogy, willingness to remove characters felt like an impediment to reader engagement. Contrast with The Expanse, which created a diverse group of people for the reader/audience engagement and took books to remove traces of their influence if they were removed from the story.I'll also note there were a couple parts where I felt we were getting a little more fantasy than sci-fi, stretching the realm of genre rules (much like the proto-molecule), so take that for what you will. There's a bit about space travel and the unseen which is supposed to stand in for light speed/warp/etc and occasionally seems more mystical than science (don't argue with me: I know science at that level is mystical. Read this and you'll see what I mean). Reminded me of Anne McCaffery's The Rowan, published in 1990.On the whole, it was engrossing, literally keeping my focus for four hours of a flight. That deserves a bonus all on it's own.Many, many thanks to both Netgalley and Orbit for the advance reader copy. Of course all opinions are my own--you ever know me to be a mouthpiece for someone else? Also, of course, all quotes are subject to change.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55278507-shards-of-earth
Axiom's End;Lindsay  Ellis;2020;2020;384;3.72;25522;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Aliens', 'Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Alternate History'];Truth is a human right.It’s fall 2007. A well-timed leak has revealed that the US government might have engaged in first contact. Cora Sabino is doing everything she can to avoid the whole mess, since the force driving the controversy is her whistleblower father. Even though Cora hasn’t spoken to him in years, his celebrity has caught the attention of the press, the Internet, the paparazzi, and the government—and with him in hiding, that attention is on her. She neither knows nor cares whether her father’s leaks are a hoax, and wants nothing to do with him—until she learns just how deeply entrenched her family is in the cover-up, and that an extraterrestrial presence has been on Earth for decades.Realizing the extent to which both she and the public have been lied to, she sets out to gather as much information as she can, and finds that the best way for her to uncover the truth is not as a whistleblower, but as an intermediary. The alien presence has been completely uncommunicative until she convinces one of them that she can act as their interpreter, becoming the first and only human vessel of communication. Their otherworldly connection will change everything she thought she knew about being human—and could unleash a force more sinister than she ever imagined.;"I feel like I'm one of the few people reading this book who wasn't already part of Ellis' fanbase. This book popped onto my radar when Lindsay Ellis posted a video on her channel about the difficulty she had, even with her platform of thousands and thousands and thousands of subscribers, in getting a publishing deal.So, that immediately meant one of two things - her book would be a gem that the publishing houses were passing on because they were dumb and elitist, or that the book simply wasn't good. The first few pages of Axiom's End make it quite clear that it's the latter category. This is a book that had it not come with Ellis' fanbase waiting in the wings would never have been published.The only way I can sum up this novel is that it's a combination of Transformers (2007), the Bumblebee spin-off film, and Twilight. Even positive reviews of this work say it feels like Transformers fanfiction, which is true. The quality of the writing of this work feels like what you'd get in fanfiction, even if there's no Bayhem. There's no much of anything, really. It's all just kind of... there.As anyone who peruses my reviews will know, I read a lot of online web serials. I'm used to reading extremely rough writing, often written immediately before it was uploaded by the author. What stuck out to me about Axiom's End is that the writing felt exactly the same. The prose is riddled with clunky sentences, bizarre phrasing, redundancies, tautologies, overwrought descriptions and the overall pacing could best be described as awkward - but not as awkward as the dialogue, which we'll get to later.Given the sheer number of these issues, and how obvious they are, I can only assume the publishers were trying to keep costs as lean as possible. It brings to mind that this novel was published because some bright mind figured that if she has x subscribers and y percentage of them buy it, we can turn a tidy profit. In that sense, you'd keep costs low. There's no evidence that they gave this book a solid edit, be it simple line or developmental or otherwise. This is a novel that was bought to be sold to a pre-existing fanbase, and it shows.I'll illustrate some of the issues with the writing below. These are phrases that leaped off the page, in the sense that I'm astounded no one fixed them.""The monitor to the computer was on, a dull blank light emanating from it, but the computer itself seemed to have been dismantled. It was up and running, but its shell had been removed, and was now on the floor.""A dull blank light? I can see what Ellis is going for, but it's not accurate. The computer seemed to be dismantled? So, was it or wasn't it? I guess not, because all that really happened was that someone had removed a panel of the case/tower? But who refers to a computer as having a shell?""It was a manual car with a stick shift.""Well, obviously. 'It was an airplane with wings.'""Cora had heard tales of CIA and FBI agents from Luciana, but she'd never actually met one.""This phrasing brings to mind Obi-Wan telling Luke tales of the ancient Jedi knights, not how people would refer to agents of the letter agencies of 2007-era America. You don't 'hear tales' of people like that. 'Luke, did I ever tell you about the Bay of Pigs incident?'I want to take the time to point out that I often like Ellis' content. Her documentary on the Hobbit films was great. Her Whole Plate on the Bayformers films, less so. Honestly, of this novel, I expected better. I won't say I expected greatness, but I expected something that wasn't so... amateur. I figured I'd get a generic YA-sort of novel, heavy on tropes. I figured I'd get a three-star book.But the prose isn't even generic. It's flat out bad. It's stuff that reflects a writer that never seemed to grow out of middle school English class 'rules' - for example, never use said.For example, in an early chapter, there are sixteen bits of dialogue. Despite being A/B exchanges, fourteen of them are directly tagged. There are four whispereds, two yelleds, one shrieked, one answered, one repeated, one managed, one demanded, one asked, one 'she heard' and one only one said.Like, this is stuff basic How To Write books castigate the reader for. Seeing it show up in a published work of someone who has made her public persona on the back of critiquing the works of others is, well, quite ironic.As an aside, I'd say the dialogue is the worst part of this novel. The characters never sound like real people and the overuse of 'exciting' dialogue tags only make it more obvious how strange it all is. I don't think there was a single line where a character sounded like a person, and the characters who managed to reach the status of having a distinct voice' would fall in and out of having it.I've seen the book sold as Transformers Meets Arrival, and that's true (if you squint) but it's also doing a disservice to those works. It's Transformers without the Bayhem (or transforming robots), it's Arrival without the deep dive into communication, it's Twilight without the earnest lust Meyer had for her Edward Cullen. It has pieces of all of these things, but none of them feel like they're part of a coherent whole.With that in mind, the book dearly wishes to explore some pretty interesting philosophical concepts, then doesn't really. For something that Ellis said she had worked on for a decade or so, I can't say this is a work that reflects it. Whatever bright idea she had, it feels like it was hollowed out over a decade of tinkering. An associate of mine claims the book was so flat that it read to them like it had been ghostwritten. The book lacks energy, it lacks passion, it lacks that spark that makes you go, ah, this is why they wanted to tell this story.I could just go on and on. The book just makes incredibly basic errors and suffers from rudimentary issues that I feel can only make it into a published work if there was no serious editorial attention given, and that reflects far worse on the publisher than it does Ellis who, by all accounts, wrote this on a bit of a lark and threw it into her trunk.All in all, the characters are bland, Cora is maddeningly passive, the plot is paced awkwardly, it borrows heavily from the aforementioned works, allusions to things like the Book of Revelation are laughable, themes barely exist and when they do they're not explored... It just goes on.There could be something good here, but it needed an intensive new draft and significant attention from editors. Unfortunately, I'm sure this book will go on to get a full trilogy because I think the cost/return benefit of this novel is what the publishers were paying attention to, not the text itself.Maybe the next two will benefit from more care, time, and consideration. But I feel Axiom's End stands as a monument to nothing other than whoever realized they could sell a book to a pre-existing audience and reap the benefits.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51171377-axiom-s-end
Defiant;Brandon Sanderson;2023;2020;420;4.34;25423;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure', 'Space'];From the #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson comes the final book in an epic series about a girl who will travel beyond the stars to save the world she loves from destruction.Spensa has made it out of the Nowhere, but what she saw in the space between the stars has changed her forever. She came face to face with the Delvers, and finally got answers to the questions she’s had about her own strange Cytonic gifts. The Superiority didn’t stop in its fight for galactic dominance while she was gone, though. Spensa’s team, Skyward Flight, was able to hold Winzik off, and even collect allies to help with the cause, but it’s only a matter of time until humanity–and the rest of the galaxy–falls. Defeating them will require all the knowledge Spensa gathered while in the Nowhere. But being Cytonic is more complicated than she ever could have imagined. Now, Spensa must ask herself: How far is she willing to go for victory, if it means losing herself–and her friends–in the process.The final book in the Skyward series will free humanity, or see it fall forever.;"This is another series wrap-up from Sanderson. Defiant is a satisfying concluding volume to the Skyward series that reflected the root of the first book: friendship.
“Some of them might die, I said. And it’s going to hurt. We’ll get through it though. Pretending that nobody will ever be in danger is the same as living in the nowhere, pretending loss doesn’t exist.”
Skyward is the fourth series by Sanderson I finished, and I am still impressed with how he is able to produce a rewarding conclusion after the blunders in Cytonic and Skyward Flight omnibus. I had a great time reading Skyward and Starsight, and I have been vocal in saying how mixed I felt about Cytonic and the titles in Skyward Flight omnibus. I stand by my words that the Skyward series is longer than it should be, and there is a good chance I won’t be reading the sequel series—Skyward Legacy—because I think the series really should’ve ended here in Defiant. But as far as Defiant goes as a series finisher, it is not one of Sanderson’s best books. However, it is definitely a page-turning conclusion with a quality as good as the first two books in the series. I will keep this review relatively brief to avoid spoilers.
“The people who brood about their moral compass in stories tend to be the strongest at making decisions.”
One of the things that decreased the quality and enjoyment of Skyward Flight and Cytonic for me, and I assume many readers, is Spensa separated from the crew of Skyward Flight. The first book, Skyward, spent a lot of time developing the relationship of Spensa with M-Bot, Jorgen, FM, Kimmalyn, and more. But the rest of the series after that did not touch upon this—except M-Bot—as much as I preferred. This situation has happened since Starsight, but for me, it was still tolerable and very much enjoyable in Starsight. But not so much in Cytonic and Skyward Flight omnibus, which only seems to prolong the series unnecessarily than it should be. I am pleased that the friendship between Spensa and her Skyward Flight crew, M-Bot, and the kitsen returns as one of the main charms of Defiant. Identity, friendship, and war are some of the main themes of Defiant, and the first half is focused on exploring the effects of Spensa and each respective—especially Jorgen—development of the other main characters.
“At the end of the story… at the end of the story, the hero came home, and found herself transformed… into someone who didn’t belong, and could never belong, with the people she’d left behind. It was the same in almost every story I’d read.”
It is not easy for Spensa to feel like she truly belongs again with her friends due to the longevity of her time separated from Jorgen and the Skyward Flight crew. The first half of Defiant is dedicated to exploring this. Essentially, the first half of Defiant demonstrated the impact of the development and changes that happened to each character in the previous three books and what each character needs to do to reignite the sense of trust between each other. This also means Spensa and Jorgen, especially Spensa, need to learn to trust their beloved companions even more. Understanding your own self and each other is a big topic in Defiant. And it can be surmised that Cytonic and Skyward Flight omnibus were all leading to the events in Defiant. The second half is all about the brief preparation and also the final battle with the main villain of the Skyward series. I had mixed feelings on Cytonic and Skyward Flight omnibus, but I cannot deny they made Defiant one of the strongest installments in the series; up there with Starsight for me.
“War has always been packed with people who didn’t want to be there.”
I don’t have any big complaints regarding the climax sequence or ending of Defiant. As I said, the preparation was worth it, and the final space war was the most exciting battle of the entire series for me. Excluding Skyward Flight omnibus, Defiant is also the first time the series utilized multiple POV chapters at the end of the book to make the Sanderlanche sequence more dynamic and effective. This did not feel jarring at all. It felt proper. We have seen the other characters’ POV in Skyward Flight omnibus, and it would feel weird if any of them did not appear as POV characters in Defiant.
“Some of them might die, I said. And it’s going to hurt. We’ll get through it though. Pretending that nobody will ever be in danger is the same as living in the nowhere, pretending loss doesn’t exist.”
Picture: DDF Phoenix-Class Battlecarrier: Defiant by Ben McSweeneyThe interior artwork by Ben McSweeney once again returned in Defiant, and it was a super welcome additional content that worked to increase my visualization and immersion of the final battle in Defiant, especially on the physical appearance of the spaceships. If there’s anything to complain about, it is back to one of my main criticisms of the series. The series does not have to be this long. Defiant could’ve ended the series satisfyingly, which it did as Sanderson has stuck the landing. But the final chapter showed hints of the next adventures of Spensa and the Skyward Flight crew story. Unfortunately, as of this moment, I am already pleased with the ending I got from Defiant, and I don’t think I will be reading the Skyward Legacy series as soon as the first book is out. I enjoyed reading the series, but I am sad to say I never felt emotionally invested in the characters as much as I should. Who knows, though. The reading mood is unpredictable, and maybe one day I might decide to read Skyward Legacy after it is finished.
“And as a ship is useless without an engine, what is an engine without people to move and protect? You act like the lone spear, Granddaughter. But a spear is always stronger as part of a phalanx.”
Overall, as expected of Sanderson’s final book of a series, Defiant ended the Skyward series satisfyingly. Oddly, my favorite characters in the series were GranGran and the slugs, which probably shows that my investment in the main characters is not as deep as I prefer. However, if you are a fan of Sanderson’s Cosmere books and you want to try reading Sanderson’s non-Cosmere work, you cannot go wrong with trying Skyward series. At the very least, the first two books should be sufficient to entertain you. Lastly, I think Skyward series would work amazingly for newcomers to reading sci-fi novels. With the completion of Skyward series, this means the only two series by Sanderson I haven't read are The Reckoners and The Rithmatist. I have no idea when I will read them, but for now, I can confidently say that my heart belongs in the Cosmere much more than any of Sanderson's non-Cosmere books.
“The purpose of life was to learn, and the way to learn was through excitement, emotion, and change. Boredom was the path to complacency, and complacency the path to stagnation.”

Winter’s Orbit;Everina Maxwell;2021;2020;432;3.99;24634;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Adult'];Ancillary Justice meets Red, White & Royal Blue in Everina Maxwell's exciting debut.While the Iskat Empire has long dominated the system through treaties and political alliances, several planets, including Thea, have begun to chafe under Iskat's rule. When tragedy befalls Imperial Prince Taam, his Thean widower, Jainan, is rushed into an arranged marriage with Taam's cousin, the disreputable Kiem, in a bid to keep the rising hostilities between the two worlds under control.But when it comes to light that Prince Taam's death may not have been an accident, and that Jainan himself may be a suspect, the unlikely pair must overcome their misgivings and learn to trust one another as they navigate the perils of the Iskat court, try to solve a murder, and prevent an interplanetary war... all while dealing with their growing feelings for each other.;If the high concept of “a wayward, scandal-magnet prince and a serious, duty-bound scholar are drafted into a political marriage and forced to work together in order to prevent an interplanetary war” appeals to you, this book is probably for you. That summary, however, does not do the story complete justice. Winter’s Orbit represents what I like best about the genre: ☑ an extraordinarily imaginative world with varied forces forming a tremulous web of fraught coexistence☑ complicated political machinations☑ that racy adventurous feel of a mystery left unsolved☑ deftly rendered characters that drive straight to your heart☑ an ineffably tender romance with high stakes All of it woven through a superbly assured prose to create the kind of storytelling that wells up to pull you into a thrilling reading experience. Winter’s Orbit also has several rewarding emotional layers. To talk about them, I'll have to spoil a few things about the story. So, spoilers ahead!***Jainan’s chapters are absolutely painful to read. From the outset, Jainan carries himself with the flinching weariness of a man with memories that require iron cages, kept still and captive so they do not devour him whole. This comes with a sense of foreboding, a whisper of wrongness. We do not immediately understand why Jainan moves so timidly through the narrative, always guarded, always careful, like he is waiting for a blow. Why he often has to realign his whole world around a single act of kindness. Why everything he thinks and does tends towards an all-pervasive self-loathing. Most chilling is the sense that Jainan’s private, repeated mantras carry the echo of someone else’s voice. The full picture soon begins to bloom like a stain across the paper: the full arc of Jainan’s traumatic relationship with his abusive ex-husband, who, for five years, used his position as an imperial prince to etch the knowledge of powerlessness directly into Jainan’s mind, cutting all Jainan’s tethers—his family, his friends, his dreams—and making sure Jainan had no ally but his abuser, which is to say, that he had no ally at all. Through Jainan’s character, the novel plumbs the cavernous depths of domestic abuse, tracing the interwoven strands of shame, anger, guilt, and sometimes even grief, that cling to survivors after they’re freed from their abusers. It’s a devastating topic, but the author handles it with so much care. Abuse, the novel hauntingly illustrates, carves a wound so deep and so hidden it takes a very long time to find it and address it. It casts a vast, horrible shadow over your relationships and leaves you unmoored. There are so few literary accounts of domestic abuse in queer relationships (something I read a while ago about it still haunts me: “when your love is taboo, so are its violences.”) so stories like Winter’s Orbit are crucial in expanding the scope of the queer experience.Prince Kiem offers a really good counterpart to Jainan's character. Prince Kiem has carefully constructed his reputation as the evanescently charming, scandal-prone prince who leads an unfettered life, the way one might erect a brick façade or drape armor around their body. One of the novel’s most rewarding moments is seeing Kiem with his defenses lowered, his shields abandoned on the ground, all the barricades abraded. Behind the charming façade is someone who is insecure and self-effacing, so tragically concerned with other people’s unfavorable opinions of him, so lonely and so desperate not to be. Someone who can also be naive sometimes: by his own admission, Prince Kiem did not care for the intricacies of war and politics and did his best to banish from his thoughts all of the Empire and its tumultuous affairs. Slowly lifting the fog of complacency and ignorance around Kiem, the novel forces him to confront several uncomfortable truths, and when it does, Kiem throws himself headlong into unearthing the secrets lodged under the Empire’s skin, holding them into the light and calling for wrongs to be set aright. All of it in a beautiful display of character-development.Obviously, Jainan and Kiem cannot be any more different. Where Kiem is loud and chaotic and draws all eyes like a flare, Jainan is a world unto himself, with a shadow’s talent for passing unremarked. For long stretches of the novel, both Jainan and Kiem keep an invisible barbed wire between them. I loved how Kiem fell in love with Jainan in one swift motion, clear and unmistakable, and how slowly he eased open Jainan’s heart like a book, mindful of the places, still tender and aching, where the past left its bruises. I loved how Jainan stood firmly by Kiem’s side, slowly learning to let go and trust that Kiem’s embrace will break his fall. This novel is about the yearning, honey. The will-they-won’t-they back and forth drove me to the brink of INSANITY, and I wanted to scream at both of them to “PLEASE JUST KISS”.All in all, Winter’s Orbit is a smart, tender, and deeply rewarding gem of space opera. I could have gladly spent twice as long with Jainan and Kiem, and still longed for more by the end.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693520-winter-s-orbit
The Darkness Outside Us;Eliot Schrefer;2021;2020;397;4.32;23882;yes;['Science Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Young Adult', 'Queer', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook'];Two boys, alone in space.After the first settler on Titan trips her distress signal, neither remaining country on Earth can afford to scramble a rescue of its own, and so two sworn enemies are installed in the same spaceship.Ambrose wakes up on the Coordinated Endeavor, with no memory of a launch. There’s more that doesn’t add up: Evidence indicates strangers have been on board, the ship’s operating system is voiced by his mother, and his handsome, brooding shipmate has barricaded himself away. But nothing will stop Ambrose from making his mission succeed—not when he’s rescuing his own sister.In order to survive the ship’s secrets, Ambrose and Kodiak will need to work together and learn to trust one another… especially once they discover what they are truly up against. Love might be the only way to survive.;Holy crap was this book mismarketed.Based on the cover and the description, I assumed this was going to be some kind of YA finnpoe/stucky ripoff space romance. I'm not going to talk too much about the plot because it's worth reading with as little upfront info as possible, but believe me when I say the romance is basically the least important aspect of this book.This is a twisty survival drama, a harrowing story about life and death and the meaning of humanity, and it is to its detriment that it was sold as YA. I could see this book getting traction among adult sci-fi audiences and I hope it finds those folks, but it has no relationship to YA except for the fact that the protagonists are, for no real reason, 17. We're past the historical moment (aka until like 2015) when all genre fiction had to be YA or face immediate oblivion. I wish Tor.com or literally anyone in the funky-yet-mainstream speculative fiction space had picked this up, because that would have been a better home for it. I was really affected by this book and I've been telling people to read it, but I'm absolutely mystified by the marketing and the choices made around it.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55200663-the-darkness-outside-us

What happens when you ask a bunch of losers, discipline cases, and misfits to save the galaxy from an ancient evil? The ancient evil wins, of course. Wait. . . . Not. So. Fast.

Everything went horribly wrong, naturally. But as it turns out, not all endings are endings, and the team has one last chance to rewrite theirs. Maybe two. It's complicated. Cue Zila, Fin, and Scarlett (and MAGELLAN!): making friends, making enemies, and making history? Sure, no problem. Cue Tyler, Kal, and Auri: uniting with two of the galaxy’s most hated villains?

One hundred and twenty-two villagers and three scientists, living in peaceful harmony. The villagers are content to fish, farm and feast, to obey their nightly curfew, to do what they're told by the scientists.Until, to the horror of the islanders, one of their beloved scientists is found brutally stabbed to death. And then they learn that the murder has triggered a lowering of the security system around the island, the only thing that was keeping the fog at bay. If the murder isn't solved within 107 hours, the fog will smother the island—and everyone on it.But the security system has also wiped everyone's memories of exactly what happened the night before, which means that someone on the island is a murderer—and they don't even know it.And the clock is ticking.;Biggest disappointment of 2024 so far...

The Mountain in the Sea;Ray Nayler;2022;2020;456;3.93;22596;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Animals', 'Thriller'];Humankind discovers intelligent life in an octopus species with its own language and culture, and sets off a high-stakes global competition to dominate the future.Rumors begin to spread of a species of hyperintelligent, dangerous octopus that may have developed its own language and culture. Marine biologist Dr. Ha Nguyen, who has spent her life researching cephalopod intelligence, will do anything for the chance to study them.The transnational tech corporation DIANIMA has sealed the remote Con Dao Archipelago, where the octopuses were discovered, off from the world. Dr. Nguyen joins DIANIMA’s team on the islands: a battle-scarred security agent and the world’s first android.The octopuses hold the key to unprecedented breakthroughs in extrahuman intelligence. The stakes are high: there are vast fortunes to be made by whoever can take advantage of the octopuses’ advancements, and as Dr. Nguyen struggles to communicate with the newly discovered species, forces larger than DIANIMA close in to seize the octopuses for themselves.But no one has yet asked the octopuses what they think. And what they might do about it.A near-future thriller about the nature of consciousness, Ray Nayler’s The Mountain in the Sea is a dazzling literary debut and a mind-blowing dive into the treasure and wreckage of humankind’s legacy.;How to make a book about homicidal octopuses suck (sorry):1. Recap every available octopus video (have you seen that one of the octopus walking across tidepools? changing color as it dreams? So has Ray Nayler!) and recent octopus book. 2. Make all your characters vehicles for plot, synopses of aforementioned octopus facts, or philosophizing about sentience and semiotics.3. Write like a stuffed shirt: ponderously, humorlessly, and with an inflated sense of your own profundity.DNF around 40%, not sure exactly because my partner with whom I was reading this book confiscated it during my last rant and it is now safely back at the library. (Someone doesn't understand the pleasure of a good hate read.) Octopuses are awesome. This book is not. At 40%, things had finally started to happen, but the octopuses were still offscreen and the humans were still being insufferable. From the faux academic chapter headers to the endless, pointless backstories, to the pretentious references (octopuses are the Odysseuses of the sea - okay, sure, but lots of animals regularly dodge death and don't end up on sushi menus), things were not going anywhere I wanted to follow.It's too bad, because I am utterly fascinated by octopuses. At one trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, I stopped by the giant pacific octopus tank while I was wearing a hat, and it unfurled itself over to check out my funny-shaped head. I looked at many organisms that day, but it was the only one who looked back. Ray Nayler is slavishly faithful to the available information on these enigmatic and astonishing animals, but the result is curiously lifeless, a philosophical thought experiment rather than red (or green!) blooded speculative fiction.If you like octopuses, read the research or watch the clips yourself. The Mountain in the Sea does the unforgivable thing of making its cephalopod subjects less interesting than they really are.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59808603-the-mountain-in-the-sea

Read Alanik’s story between Starsight and Cytonic.“Don’t trust their lies. Don’t trust their false peace.” That is the warning that Alanik of the planet ReDawn gave the human pilot Spensa after Alanik’s ship crash-landed on Detritus. While accepting an invitation to meet with her people’s enemy, the Galactic Superiority, Alanik heard Spensa’s cry for help across the vastness of space, and she used her cytonic powers to hyperjump her ship to the source of that cry. What she found there was a shock—a whole planet of free humans fighting against the Superiority. Were they the allies her people desperately needed?

Elder Race;Adrian Tchaikovsky;2021;2020;201;4.11;18625;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Novella', 'Horror', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult'];In Adrian Tchaikovsky's Elder Race, a junior anthropologist on a distant planet must help the locals he has sworn to study to save a planet from an unbeatable foe.Lynesse is the lowly Fourth Daughter of the queen, and always getting in the way.But a demon is terrorizing the land, and now she’s an adult (albeit barely) and although she still gets in the way, she understands that the only way to save her people is to invoke the pact between her family and the Elder sorcerer who has inhabited the local tower for as long as her people have lived here (though none in living memory has approached it).But Elder Nyr isn’t a sorcerer, and he is forbidden to help, for his knowledge of science tells him the threat cannot possibly be a demon…;"Elder Race, or, a post on which I muse about feelings, productivity, and the futility of blurbing.Goodreads lists over thirty books written by Tchaikovsky, and that's not including another seventy plus short stories he lists on his website. This is one prolific author. After joining Nataliya on buddy reads of a number of novellas, I've come to the conclusion that he has a lot of strengths when it comes to the style of sci-fi I enjoy, but lacks a certain attention to detail to move most of his works into the stratosphere. The first work I read by him was the memorable and undoubtedly to-be-classic Children of Time, and nothing has quite stood up to that mind-blowing arachnophilic experience. Elder Races is no different. As an aside, I'll note that the Goodreads blurb is close to useless at clues to contents and experience. This is a modern remake of Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover series, anthropologist and all. In fact, if you want an interesting and more profound female-centric and complicated love relationship, I highly recommend The Rununciate trilogy, particularly Thendara House. It also reminded me of Andre Norton's The Witch World saga. Both have their roots in a culture clash of a space-faring sexually egalitarian civilization that was almost absent, and a more feudal and gender-unequal one. Both also play with the idea of Clarke's Third Law, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,"" adding a fascinating corollary: even technology can't explain everything.Elder Races sticks to this cultural disconnect and tech-magic heritage, alternating viewpoints between the last anthropologist of a space-faring empire and the young and free-spirited woman who wants to lead the fight against a demon. The anthropologist from the Earth Explorer Corps, Nyr, has been in cold-sleep for decades, waiting for contact from his team while he intermittently collects information on the locals. His work is aided by a Dissociative Cognition System, a 'mod' that allows him to shut away feelings and function only with the 'reason' part of his brain. ""Descending in the elevator, I am very aware of all the sad I am not feeling, how lonely and lost I don't care that I am, and how trivial it is that I am utterly cut off from the civilization that gave rise to me, and anyone who might now or care who Nyr Illim Tevitch is.""Lynesse, the headstrong local, is the proverbial fourth child of the Queen, mildly indulged but mostly considered unimportant in a matriarchal lineage of a feudal, status-conscious society. When she learns of a demon devouring people and even villages, she decides to seek the help of Elder Nyr to vanquish it. Nyr, in turn, is haunted by memories of Lynesse's great-grand from the last time he went against his anthropological training.Clearly, a lot of fascinating ideas to play with, and one of Tchaikovsky's strengths is the way he throws in teasers that give the reader the idea there's more to learn. He delivers just enough to make for a happy ending, but not really enough for a satisfactory and fulfilling one. There's a side bit about Esha, one of the 'marsh-people' that accompanies them that sounds interesting, as well as teasers about the disappearance of the other Earth anthropologists, and the impact of corporal punishment in the local society, but these aren't really germane. In fact, it's the kind of detail that argues for a longer book instead of novella, so that these inclusions can get the development their inclusion warrants. The plot is easily the least-interesting thing about this novella. Despite the dual narrative, and Tchaikovsky's attempts to make me care about Lynesse's emotional journey, the internal struggles of Nyr have center stage. Deservedly so; the ideas of cultural competence, language, and feelings are timeless and pertinent. Unfortunately, there's too much here, so everything but character development feels a little shorted, with the bit about the DCI the most fascinating. It's a pleasant enough read, but if I want impactful, I'd rather re-read Thendara House--although I read it enough times as a young adult that it's probably not necessary.As always, the blog has a bunch of linky-links for references. https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2021/...Nataliya is on a Tchaikovsky buddy-read binge, and I am completely unable to deny her. This time, Dylan also joined in for the ride. His note that it seemed like a light version of Rocannon's World by LeGuin is particularly interesting, and merits a placement of it on my TBR list.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50663055-elder-race
Termination Shock;Neal Stephenson;2021;2020;708;3.83;17937;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Thriller', 'Climate Change', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Dystopia'];"A visionary technothriller about climate change. Neal Stephenson's sweeping, prescient new novel transports readers to a near-future world where the greenhouse effect has inexorably resulted in a whirling-dervish troposphere of superstorms, rising sea levels, global flooding, merciless heat waves, and virulent, deadly pandemics. One man has a Big Idea for reversing global warming, a master plan perhaps best described as ""elemental."" But will it work? And just as important, what are the consequences for the planet and all of humanity should it be applied? Ranging from the Texas heartland to the Dutch royal palace in the Hague, from the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas to the sunbaked Chihuahuan Desert, Termination Shock brings together a disparate group of characters from different cultures and continents who grapple with the real-life repercussions of global warming. Ultimately, it asks the question: Might the cure be worse than the disease?";"I read this latest ultra-near-future story of science fiction by Neal Stephenson on a road trip through the American West. We drove under smoky skies and through swirling wildfire ash. We whipped through thousands of acres of desert transformed into open-air ag factories, irrigated by water trapped by a dam that is four times the size of the big pyramid at Giza. We skirted or traversed some 7 current reservations and countless lands previously promised to and then taken back from the people who already lived there. We were still in the throes of an airborne epidemic yet the fierce individualists of flyover country murmured behind our backs when we went to get hotel coffee wearing a mask. ""Think she's gonna rob the place?"" No, old-timer, I'm just trying to keep us all alive long enough for you to finish that cigarette you're smoking indoors.SIGH.So EVERY PAGE of this rip-roaring globe-trotting totally wonkish yet completely entertaining novel about climate change (""climate change,"" tsk how have I been converted to this toothless term? It's global fucking warming, not menopause. Not that menopause isn't catastrophic in its own right) had something that pertained to my lived experience RIGHT NOW. You really ought to read it. It's a cogent way to learn about solar geoengineering, Sikh martial arts, the Dutch monarchy, copper and sulfur mining, AND the Line of Actual Control, an incredibly important thing that I didn't know anything about until I read about it in a Neal Stephenson novel and then spent 30 minutes googling -- something a character in this book does in exactly the same way some hundred pages after I did it. Talk about your near-future. You could read about these things in MIT Technology Review (https://www.technologyreview.com/2019...) or on The Bridge (https://thebridge.in/featured/gatka-t...) or you could charge your way through this book like I did.In the vernacular of fifteen years ago Internet language (me I'm going to write near-past science fiction when I retire): this is relevant to my interests.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57094295-termination-shock

Mickey7;Edward Ashton;2022;2020;296;3.75;15316;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Adult', 'Aliens', 'Thriller'];Dying isn’t any fun…but at least it’s a living.Mickey7 is an Expendable: a disposable employee on a human expedition sent to colonize the ice world Niflheim. Whenever there’s a mission that’s too dangerous—even suicidal—the crew turns to Mickey. After one iteration dies, a new body is regenerated with most of his memories intact. After six deaths, Mickey7 understands the terms of his deal…and why it was the only colonial position unfilled when he took it.On a fairly routine scouting mission, Mickey7 goes missing and is presumed dead. By the time he returns to the colony base, surprisingly helped back by native life, Mickey7’s fate has been sealed. There’s a new clone, Mickey8, reporting for Expendable duties. The idea of duplicate Expendables is universally loathed, and if caught, they will likely be thrown into the recycler for protein.Mickey7 must keep his double a secret from the rest of the colony. Meanwhile, life on Niflheim is getting worse. The atmosphere is unsuitable for humans, food is in short supply, and terraforming is going poorly. The native species are growing curious about their new neighbors, and that curiosity has Commander Marshall very afraid. Ultimately, the survival of both lifeforms will come down to Mickey7.That is, if he can just keep from dying for good.;"If I die, you can always make another me.
When I saw the premise for this book, I knew it was going on my TBR posthaste. It sounds so interesting and unlike anything I've come across before.Mickey has the most unusual job: he is expected to risk life and limb to do dangerous work on the space colony. Dying is really no big deal since they can just pump out a new clone of him imprinted with his memories and personality. When a job goes sideways and the colony thinks Mickey7 is dead, they immediately create Mickey8. But the problem is that Mickey7 is still very much alive. Now the two Mickey's are in real trouble. They can't tell anyone that there are two of him running around, for to be a multiple is considered the ultimate abomination, one from which there is no coming back.When I started this book, I had high hopes. Not only is the premise fabulous, but the writing at first glance feels fast-paced and conversational, making this an extremely easy book to get into. I was breezing through the pages, on the edge of my seat, waiting for the story to take a turn into something brilliant.I kept waiting and waiting. And then I reached the end. Welp.The problem is that the story never really goes much past the premise. In fact, most of the conflict comes down to the two Mickey's being hungry. The rest of the time is spent on flashbacks to Mickey's earlier reincarnations and digression on how other space colonies have done on different worlds. It's not that those aren't interesting, but they're just not what I was expecting.The writing style also veers a bit towards the flippant side for my taste. It's lots of slang and jargon, thrown around to make the whole thing feel both casual and authentic. But it didn't quite ring true for me. I've seen comparisons of the narrator's style to Andy Weir, but this isn't The Martian. Mark Watney solves actual problems, while Mickey mostly sounds off.Maybe my expectations were just too high. I thought this would be an insightful and thrilling story, taking me somewhere I've never been before. Instead, the whole story is pretty much the premise. It was a fast and decent read, but I can't help feel it fell short of its lofty potential.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693457-mickey7
Eyes of the Void;Adrian Tchaikovsky;2022;2020;596;4.2;14958;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure'];The Arthur C. Clarke award-winning author of Children of Time brings us the second novel in an extraordinary space opera trilogy about humanity on the brink of extinction, and how one man's discovery will save or destroy us all.After eighty years of fragile peace, the Architects are back, wreaking havoc as they consume entire planets. In the past, Originator artefacts – vestiges of a long-vanished civilization – could save a world from annihilation. This time, the Architects have discovered a way to circumvent these protective relics. Suddenly, no planet is safe.Facing impending extinction, the Human Colonies are in turmoil. While some believe a unified front is the only way to stop the Architects, others insist humanity should fight alone. And there are those who would seek to benefit from the fractured politics of war – even as the Architects loom ever closer.Idris, who has spent decades running from the horrors of his past, finds himself thrust back onto the battlefront. As an Intermediary, he could be one of the few to turn the tide of war. With a handful of allies, he searches for a weapon that could push back the Architects and save the galaxy. But to do so, he must return to the nightmarish unspace, where his mind was broken and remade.What Idris discovers there will change everything.;"“This is the salvage ship Vulture God to whoeverthefuck’s even down there. Call for Idris Telemmier, double urgent. Idris, this is Olli. You remember? Olli, your fucking captain? Being kidnapped doesn’t excuse you from turning up for duty, you skiving bastard. Idris, or Idris’s kidnappers. Say something, damn it!”
Adrian Tchaikovsky can be counted on to provide consistently good quality books at such a speed that I suspect he’s either a conglomerate of writers or a clone army — or maybe he just really likes what he does and is very good at it. No, you know what — it *must* be the clone army thing.In any case, Eyes of the Void is an excellent follow-up to last year’s British Science Fiction Award-winning Shards of Earth, fully convincing me that despite his amazing versatility Tchaikovsky really shines in science fiction realm. It’s a space opera, like its predecessor, and despite including the genre staples that give it a genre classic feel it still manages to remain clever, fresh, gripping and decidedly not silly. A ragtag crew of misfits in space, interstellar travel, wars, politics, space gangsters, alien cultists, AI — you name it — all manage to create quite a delicious science fiction concoction here. 
“Because unspace wasn’t real. And when you entered unspace, you weren’t real either. You existed only in the bubble of your own consciousness and, even if you gripped the hand of your neighbour painfully tight, as many of them did, those fingers would become empty the moment the ship dropped from the real.” “We’re basically standing at the edge of a raw wound between unspace and the real.” 
In the face of continued slow destruction of planets and lives by mysterious moon-sized Architects humanity - of fragging course! - has not banded together. Instead it’s business as usual, from petty squabbles to all-out war between humanity’s largest factions, because humans often lack the vision of the bigger picture (“The Architects weren’t only back, they were making up for lost time, losing patience with the universe.”) And our ragtag team on the scavenger ship The Vulture God, having pissed off almost anyone with any semblance of power in the first book, found temporary reprieve among the Parthenon, being viewed as traitors to the greater human race in the meantime. But the reprieve doesn’t last for long as there is not only the continued deadly menace of the Architects but also the continuing squabbles over who gets to “own” Idris Telemmier, an Intermediary whose nature allows him to pilot through Unspace as well as (almost) communicate with the Architects — but doesn’t protect him from being constantly used and kidnapped.
“He hadn’t properly asked himself what he would prefer to do. The idea that it would be relevant had never occurred to him.”————“He was the canary in the mine, and you always brought the canary. Nobody cared that the canary didn’t much enjoy its job and would maybe like to be doing something else.”
And the Originator ruins on a planet from hell may just hold enough clues to the mystery of the Architects and the universe itself. 
“Then he knew. And it wasn’t what he’d thought. He felt leaden and bitter, even as Ahab exulted that the universe had finally given up its secrets.”
Yes, it’s a middle book in the series that will not give too many answers and that sets up the events to come, but once again it wraps up its storyline nicely, all while continuing wonderful worldbuilding and interesting characters. And while it leaves me wanting more (I need all the answers about the universe, and I want them now! “42” is not a satisfying answer, dammit!) I’m very satisfied with the journey it took me on.
“He didn’t want to take the war to the Architects. He didn’t want to be any part of what might be genocide. But neither the universe nor the war was done with him yet.”

Agency;William Gibson;2020;2020;413;3.81;13316;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Audiobook', 'Time Travel', 'Thriller', 'Speculative Fiction'];"In William Gibson's first novel since 2014's New York Times bestselling The Peripheral, a gifted ""app-whisperer"" is hired by a mysterious San Francisco start-up and finds herself in contact with a unique and surprisingly combat-savvy AI.";"I never thought I would use the phrase ""tedious William Gibson novel,"" but apparently this is the version of the world we now live in. This tedious William Gibson novel is clearly a William Gibson novel: it has the effortless prose, the vivid (if occasionally inaccurate) imagery, the geek-culture namedrops, the characters who are outsiders to power and the mainstream. What it doesn't have much of is a plot, and what the characters don't have much of, by irony that may or may not be unconscious, is agency. They do almost nothing that has any impact on anything. In fact, they do almost nothing, and it's narrated at great length. The author establishes a strict alternation between two viewpoint characters: Verity, in a version of 2017 California where the US election of 2016 and the Brexit vote went the other way, and Netherton, in a post-apocalyptic future descended, quite possibly, from our version of the timeline. This strict alternation regardless of what's going on and who has the most at stake at the time, and this choice of viewpoint characters, soon begin to work against the success of the book. Both viewpoint characters are essentially passive. Verity spends most of the book as a passenger, being moved around to escape from a corrupt corporation who hired her at the start of the novel. It's never really clear to me why anyone involves Netherton in events, rather than just going direct; he's a go-between and a middleman and an observer, and the one effective thing he does (fighting off a random encounter that has no lead-up and no follow-through) is entirely by accident. Many of the chapters, particularly the Netherton ones, consist of someone, usually Netherton, repeating something we have just been shown in the previous chapter to someone else who wasn't observing at the time. (Not very far into the book, the two viewpoints connect, by a technological means of communication that's never explained in any depth, but looks to the users like VR.)The beginning is promising. Verity is hired by that dodgy corporation because of her reputation as an ""app whisperer"" to do vague things with a new alpha build, an implausibly advanced AI called Eunice. Eunice is templated on a feisty, fiercely intelligent and capable African-American woman, and is by far the most interesting character in the book; after she disappears (relatively early on), the novel immediately bogs down in exposition, pipe-laying, long descriptions of logistics (she sat here, she put her bag there, she looked at this), and people explaining things to other people that we've just been shown in the previous chapter. Once Eunice unexpectedly returns through no action of the other characters, the book wraps up rapidly, but without much involvement of the carefully-gathered group of people who are supposedly the protagonists; they have spent all their time while the world was threatened with nuclear disaster doing mostly mundane or evil-corporation-avoidance-related things, rather than working on anything to do with the threat, and the unnamed president, clearly Hillary Clinton, sorts it all out anyway with hardly any help even from Eunice - revealing that the normally pessimistic Gibson has a more optimistic view than I do about at least one thing: HRC's potential to be a great and wonderful president, rather than simply a much more competent and all-around less bad one than Trump. I got the feeling partway through that the excessive number of secondary characters with backstories that didn't seem relevant to the current story were left over from a previous novel, and indeed it seems this is a sequel to The Peripheral. I was surprised to discover, looking at the front of the book where they are listed, that I'd missed three novels by Gibson since the last one I read, so I don't know if the mediocre dullness of this one is a new development or part of a trend. Since I got a pre-release version from Netgalley, I also don't know if the couple of glitches (such as placing jungle-dwelling orangutans on the savanna, or having the very British Netherton repeatedly refer to a bowler hat by the solely American term ""derby"") will be fixed before publication; they may be. What I don't think can be fixed is the overnarration of mundane logistics that stands where a plot would normally go, or the limp and ineffectual puppets that are the viewpoint characters. Accordingly, I'm awarding this my non-prize for Most Disappointing Novel Read in 2019.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34943643-agency
Translation State;Ann Leckie;2023;2020;422;4.09;11856;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Fantasy'];"The mystery of a missing translator sets three lives on a collision course that will have a ripple effect across the stars in this powerful new novel by award-winning author Ann Leckie.Qven was created to be a Presger translator. The pride of their Clade, they always had a clear path before them: learn human ways, and eventually, make a match and serve as an intermediary between the dangerous alien Presger and the human worlds. The realization that they might want something else isn't ""optimal behavior"". I's the type of behavior that results in elimination.But Qven rebels. And in doing so, their path collides with those of two others. Enae, a reluctant diplomat whose dead grandmaman has left hir an impossible task as an inheritance: hunting down a fugitive who has been missing for over 200 years. And Reet, an adopted mechanic who is increasingly desperate to learn about his genetic roots--or anything that might explain why he operates so differently from those around him.As a Conclave of the various species approaches--and the long-standing treaty between the humans and the Presger is on the line--the decisions of all three will have ripple effects across the stars.Masterfully merging space adventure and mystery, and a poignant exploration about relationships and belonging, Translation State is a standalone story set in Leckie's celebrated Imperial Radch universe.";"So few of my usual tags make sense here. Main character of color? Check, only of course in Ann Leckie's future worlds the category hardly applies since most humans are some variety of brown and many persons are not even human. Humor? Check, except for how the existence of baby Presger Translators is Hobbesian and then some. Child abuse? See the preceding. Trans characters? Ehhh ... kind of? Only, like race, the category barely applies since in the Radch everybody is denominated female and in the other polities there are multiple gender designations none of which seem to be connected to anyone's genitals (I bet Ann Leckie would have a thing or two to say to any TERF she happened on). Come to think of it, we never learn anything about anyone's genitals even though, as Qven -- the Presger Translator who's one of the three protagonists -- puts it, several of the characters do sex. Anyway, like Leckie's other books, Translation State functions on the level of political meditation -- who is a person? what does ""human"" mean? how, if at all, do genetics and identity match up? how much does our genetic inheritance affect our actions? what choices do the seemingly powerless have, and how can they influence or change the structures of power? But God, nobody enjoys political tracts disguised as novels, so it's fortunate that Leckie's protagonists and their friends and family are so appealing, that her plots are twisty and suspenseful, and that her future worlds are so imaginative. I loved Enae, Reet, and Qven (if you don't laugh at Qven's body count during a crucial meeting, you're made of stronger stuff than I) and I stayed up way too late two nights in a row biting my nails over what would become of them. (Psst: Sphene shows up late in the action, wearing a kilt and NO GLOVES OMG!)Leckie leaves intact certain conventions with which we're familiar: Mr., Ms., and Mx. as terms of address; coffee (and of course tea); long lines at checkpoints for incoming travelers. Some of these, especially the terms of address, surprised me, but I think she's made an authorial choice to locate the strangeness and disorientation of her world in more fundamental places. Besides, you know if anything's going to be a human constant even hundreds of thousands of years from now, it'll be bureaucracy. Look out, by the way, for a nifty subversion of the arranged-marriage romance trope. Sincere thanks to NetGalley and Orbit for the ARC. I can't wait for the audiobook, and I'm crossing my fingers that Adjoa Andoh narrates it as she did Leckie's other works.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62873999-translation-state
The Book of Koli;M.R. Carey;2020;2020;416;4.01;11505;yes;['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Horror', 'Audiobook'];Beyond the walls of the small village of Mythen Rood lies an unrecognizable world. A world where overgrown forests are filled with choker trees and deadly vines and seeds that will kill you where you stand. And if they don't get you, one of the dangerous shunned men will.Koli has lived in Mythen Rood his entire life. He knows the first rule of survival is that you don't venture beyond the walls.What he doesn't know is - what happens when you aren't given a choice?The first in a gripping new trilogy, The Book of Koli charts the journey of one unforgettable young boy struggling to find his place in a chilling post-apocalyptic world.;"I'm a sucker for a post-apocalyptic novel, so when it seemed like some friends wanted to read The Book of Koli, followed by a serendipitous sale, it seemed like a good time for a flash group read. Plus, aggressive plants! And I don't mean in that annoying, never-get-that-burr-out-of-wool kind of way, or the poison-ivy-burn kind of way, but plants that actually chased down and squished people. Fun times!Oh, except Koli. Koli is not fun, as Koli is a teenage boy. One thing you can say about M.R. Carey: he writes many shades of extremely annoying characters. From Felix Castor the alcoholic wizard (the Felix Castor series); to The Boy on the Bridge, Stephen Greaves; to Koli, currently Faceless. I mean, Carey nails it. Koli is pretty much like that emotionally immature ten year-old that you know but don't want to mention, in case his mom gets pissed. He spends free time playing with the friends. He moons after his bestie, Spinner. He's unable to verbalize his feelings or thoughts to friends, family or himself; we're getting the benefit of much of this through past-lens. Despite his community having a clear-cut coming-of-age ceremony, he's given no thought to his life and what he might become. When he doesn't magically become 'special,' he is crushed, and becomes despondent. He has no solution, and only a chance encounter with a passing stranger gives him a new goal. Not one with noble purpose, mind you, but to merely take a different route to the same magical 'specialness.' Oh yes; he has emotional immaturity written all over him.""I was fifteen years old, I thought myself in love and in all respects I was as shallow as a puddle.""It's enough to make you want to shake a certain Koli, honestly. While I have to give kudos to Carey for such clear characterization, further discussion with my co-readers leads me to question Koli's developmental stage in context of his society. Undoubtedly, Carey had some real-life basis for his 15 year-old ; the trouble is that none of the 15 year-olds he knows has had to do physical labor to contribute to family and society, or has been under deadly threat if stepping beyond the perimeter of their village. However, viewed in context of the now-traditional dystopian Young-Adult set-up, as explained by karen, perhaps it makes more sense.Which is, unfortunately, where Carey lets us down. The Girl With All the Gifts was fabulous, but it was largely about character growth in an immediately post-apocalyptic world. In Koli, there is slow character growth in a somewhat puzzling and not clearly conceived world. Eventually, pieces of it of the puzzle start to come together, but it's quite late in the book, and in some ways, it makes even less sense. Our group, for instance, ended up quite puzzled over the time lapse. We ended up thinking it was a couple hundred years lapse, but in a Reddit thread, Carey states, ""the books are set in a post-apocalyptic world, at least a century or so after the collapse of our global civilisation, that has reverted to a more or less medieval way of life. Climate breakdown has left the world scarred, but the scientific interventions meant to save it have done even more harm.""The parts that are interesting are the supporting characters, Ursala and Monono. Monono's slang speech is particularly entertaining and provides a lot of in-jokes for the reader. I actually enjoyed Monono a great deal, and interestingly, she goes through her own kind of evolution as well. She becomes a strangely empowered little being, providing a solid counterpoint to Koli, and I look forward to what she will do in the future.“Then what you were feeling was monono aware. The sadness that’s deep down inside beautiful things. The pain and suckiness of everything having a shelf life.""My sense was that Carey was a 'pantser' writer (versus a 'planner'), and further reading on the thread confirmed it. Koli originally was a 'Koli and Cup' magic tale, which explains so well why the tech, the society and the language drift all are so random. I don't hate it, but the beginning of the story is slow enough that the build of the society nagged at me as I read. What it really needed is some plot to move it along and distract me (along the lines of Station Eleven), but it isn't until over a third in that tension starts building, and halfway before leaving the village. I can see where this might truly be a trilogy (or one book broken into three?) rather than three installments of a life (like Murderbot).I think this may have been a time when the company made the book a little more enjoyable. Though I was a bit lukewarm on the book, Monono and my co-readers made it special, so I'll be going on to the next.Links to the reddit, etc on the blog post Sunday.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51285749-the-book-of-koli

It explores queer relationships and queer feelings, capitalism and accountability, labor and love, all with a bouncing sense of humor and a commitment to the strange.When an elderly customer at a Swedish big box furniture store—but not that one—slips through a portal to another dimension, it's up to two minimum-wage employees to track her across the multiverse and protect their company's bottom line. Multi-dimensional swashbuckling would be hard enough, but those two unfortunate souls broke up a week ago.To find the missing granny, Ava and Jules will brave carnivorous furniture, swarms of identical furniture spokespeople, and the deep resentment simmering between them.

Not the fun, page-turning romp about two exes who have to track an elderly woman through the multiverse after IKEA's maze-like interior punches a whole through space-time that I signed up for, but still okay. The plot plods along and the characters could emote more effusively, but the book's biggest strength lies in its razor-sharp critique of capitalism and the subpar treatment of retail workers.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44081573-finna

All she knows is that somewhere out there, beyond the horizon, she has a sister named Kay, and it’s up to Cee to cross the ocean and find her.In a world apart, 16-year-old STEM prodigy Kasey Mizuhara lives in an eco-city built for people who protected the planet―and now need protecting from it. With natural disasters on the rise due to climate change, eco-cities provide clean air, water, and shelter.

Logic says that her sister must be dead. But nevertheless, she decides to retrace Celia’s last steps. Where they’ll lead her, she does not know. Her sister was full of secrets.

Hunt the Stars;Jessie Mihalik;2022;2020;419;4.03;10397;yes;['Romance', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Adult', 'Aliens'];Octavia Zarola would do anything to keep her tiny, close-knit bounty hunting crew together—even if it means accepting a job from Torran Fletcher, a ruthless former general and her sworn enemy. When Torran offers her enough credits to not only keep her crew afloat but also hire someone to fix her ship, Tavi knows that she can’t refuse—no matter how much she’d like to.With so much money on the line, Torran and his crew insist on joining the hunt. Tavi reluctantly agrees because while the handsome, stoic leader pushes all of her buttons—for both anger and desire—she’s endured worse, and the massive bonus payment he’s promised for a completed job is reason enough to shut up and deal.But when they uncover a deeper plot that threatens the delicate peace between humans and Valoffs, Tavi suspects that Torran has been using her as the impetus for a new war. With the fate of her crew balanced on a knife’s edge, Tavi must decide where her loyalties lie—with the quiet Valoff who’s been lying to her, or with the human leaders who left her squad to die on the battlefield. And this time, she’s put her heart on the line.The critically acclaimed author of Polaris Rising takes readers on an exciting journey with the start of her brand-new series about a female bounty hunter and the man who is her sworn enemy.;ive been craving a fun and easy going sci-fi read and this totally hit the spot.it reminded me a lot of ‘aurora rising,’ just with adult characters instead of teens - theres a mission in space and a crew forced to work together that becomes a found family. my only critique is the first half of the book is pretty slow paced and primarily exposition. the actual plot itself doesnt pick up until after the 50% mark. but the characters are enjoyable to read about and i liked the world-building/set up.and even though i did have fun with this, everything ends so nicely that i dont feel an immediate desire to pick up the next book in the series. maybe i will when im craving a sci-fi book again. ↠ 4 stars;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56754734-hunt-the-stars

The only ones who can stop this from happening are the Sentinels—the recruits, exiles, and dregs of the military. At the Divide, Adequin Rake is in charge of the Argus, and she has no one besides her soldiers and her possible ace—a genius and exiled prince—in the hole: Cavalon Mercer. The Last Watch is the first book in The Divide series by J.S. Dewes, and it has been garnering a lot of super positive receptions from readers. Honestly, from the premise alone, this sounds like The Night Watch from A Song of Ice and Fire, but in space. And that sounds incredibly intriguing to me. But two aspects prevented me from enjoying it further.The first issue I had with The Last Watch was characterizations. I personally found the novel to be lacking in this department. I never once felt like I cared for Adequin Rake, Cavalon Mercer, or anybody else. They’re the drivers that steer the vehicles of the story, but they remain strangers to me from beginning to the end. It’s unfortunate, but a slightly more focus on characterizations and motivations in the first half of the novel would’ve boosted my reading experience so much. Seriously, the actions and pacing in the second half were superbly done. It’s a very subjective critic, I know that many readers have voiced that they loved Rake and Cavalon. For me, I wish I felt more invested in the characters for me to genuinely care about the struggles they’re dealing with.The second issue was that I felt that there needed to be more elaboration on world-building and background. A suspension of disbelief was sorely needed, and this didn’t happen once or twice; it occurred multiple times throughout the entire novel. Many times I actually considered DNFing this book; the pacing was too slow in the first half of the novel, and slow-paced novels are novels that I usually loved, but in this case, there weren’t any characters I felt invested in. Because of this, the reading became a struggle.As I said in the beginning, I do honestly believe that The Last Watch would work incredibly well as a sci-fi movie, and I hope it gets a movie adaptation one day. There were some truly—technically—magnificent scenes, and it was a shame I couldn’t enjoy them as much as I hoped because I couldn’t care about the characters. Also, please do not take my review for this novel fully to heart; I strongly suggest you give it a try for yourself if you love sci-fi/space opera or story with a band of misfits doing their best to save humanity. Plus, The Last Watch has been gaining a lot of good reviews, and I’m most likely just fell a bit on the unpopular opinion side here. It wasn’t a bad book for me, but it was okay, and it could’ve been more. I am very much a character-driven reader, and The Last Watch, to me, felt entirely plot-driven.You can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)The quotes in this review were taken from an ARC and are subject to change upon publication.You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons on Patreon for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Ben, Blaise, Devin, Diana, Dylan, Edward, Ellen, Gary, Hamad, Helen, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Lufi, Melinda, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Sarah, Seth, Shaad, Summer, Wendy, Zoe.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53205794-the-last-watch
Ascension;Nicholas Binge;2023;2020;344;3.58;9973;no;['Science Fiction', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];A mind-bending speculative thriller in which the sudden appearance of a mountain in the middle of the Pacific Ocean leads a group of scientists to a series of jaw-dropping revelations that challenge the notion of what it means to be human.An enormous snow-covered mountain has appeared in the Pacific Ocean. No one knows when exactly it showed up, precisely how big it might be, or how to explain its existence. When Harold Tunmore, a scientist of mysterious phenomena, is contacted by a shadowy organization to help investigate, he has no idea what he is getting into as he and his team set out for the mountain.  The higher Harold’s team ascends, the less things make sense. Time moves differently, turning minutes into hours, and hours into days. Amid the whipping cold of higher elevation, the climbers’ limbs numb and memories of their lives before the mountain begin to fade. Paranoia quickly turns to violence among the crew, and slithering, ancient creatures pursue them in the snow. Still, as the dangers increase, the mystery of the mountain compels them to its peak, where they are certain they will find their answers. Have they stumbled upon the greatest scientific discovery known to man or the seeds of their own demise?  Framed by the discovery of Harold Tunmore’s unsent letters to his family and the chilling and provocative story they tell, Ascension considers the limitations of science and faith and examines both the beautiful and the unsettling sides of human nature.;"If you ever read this, tell others. Don’t come here. Don’t come here.
The problem with this book, I feel, is it is just a tad too cheesy and ridiculous for speculative fiction. I found it more palatable when I told myself it was horror.Ascension definitely works better as a horror-- monstrous creatures in the night, minds being taken over by mystical forces, religious themes, campy twists --but I came in expecting something akin to Sylvain Neuvel's Sleeping Giants so I was disappointed.Also, the epistolary format is usually one I enjoy, but it did not work for me here. I couldn't quite buy into Harold sitting down to write these exceptionally detailed letters in between being pursued by various mountain horrors. And it bothered me that he was addressing his young niece in them-- would he really include all the ""fucks"" and references to making love to his wife? It was one more thing that ruined my suspension of disbelief.Then there were the extensive flashbacks, which bored me. I'm sure they were there to break up the monotony of mountain trek, run from the monsters, trek trek, run from the monsters, but I really didn't care that much.I already mentioned the ""campy twist"" above, but I really feel the need to emphasise how much this made me cringe. When Harold realises the truth, it's made into a big sinister aha moment, but it was just sort of funny. Their companion Neil Amai's name spells I am alien backwards.None of this was helped by the fact that ""The Climb"" by Miley Cyrus came into my head at the start of the ascension and the more I read, the more the book seemed to parody the lyrics.

The Paradox Hotel;Rob Hart;2022;2020;336;3.54;9109;no;['Science Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Time Travel', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook'];An impossible crime. A detective on the edge of madness. The future of time travel at stake.January Cole’s job just got a whole lot harder.Not that running security at the Paradox was ever really easy. Nothing’s simple at a hotel where the ultra-wealthy tourists arrive costumed for a dozen different time periods, all eagerly waiting to catch their “flights” to the past.Or where proximity to the timeport makes the clocks run backward on occasion—and, rumor has it, allows ghosts to stroll the halls.None of that compares to the corpse in room 526. The one that seems to be both there and not there. The one that somehow only January can see.On top of that, some very important new guests have just checked in. Because the U.S. government is about to privatize time-travel technology—and the world’s most powerful people are on hand to stake their claims.January is sure the timing isn’t a coincidence. Neither are those “accidents” that start stalking their bidders.There’s a reason January can glimpse what others can’t. A reason why she’s the only one who can catch a killer who’s operating invisibly and in plain sight, all at once.But her ability is also destroying her grip on reality—and as her past, present, and future collide, she finds herself confronting not just the hotel’s dark secrets but her own.;"The Paradox Hotel by Rob HartParadox Hotel detective, January Cole. is Unstuck. Because she worked as security for the U.S. government's time travel organization for years, traveling to various time periods to thwart people who try to alter the present and future by changing past events, her mental state is degrading. With increasing frequency, January is finding herself in past and future moments and she is unable to control when these ""skips"" happen. She won't admit to her boss that she is in Stage 2 of being Unstuck but instead claims she can continue to do her job while in Stage 1. Soon she'll be in Stage 3 and that is lights out for January, she'll be comatose and unable to take care of herself. My favorite character in this story is Ruby, January's hacked drone who has been allowed to develop a snarky personality due to January hacking it. The book is full of characters, way too many characters, with hotel employees, four trillionaires, who are in a bidding war to take the time travel enterprise private, the minions of the trillionaires, ""ghosts"", and the hotel visitors. Add in that January is experiencing past, present, and future events and things are pretty confusing. It's bad enough that January is having these ""skips"" but something is also very wrong with the time-travel technology and the present timeline. Creatures from the various time periods are showing up in the present timeline, the master clock is malfunctioning, someone is trying to kill off the trillionaires, and the security video and other hotel tech has been hacked. On top of all of that, January's boss wants her gone from the hotel because her state of mind is interfering with her decision making skills. Oh yes, and there is a huge snow storm that traps everyone in the hotel, with not enough rooms and with super rich tourists making impossible demands. Despite how confusing things were in the first part of the book, I thought I was keeping up pretty well. Sure, I didn't understand half of what was going on but once we get to the climatic show down scenes, I was lost. After I finished the book and tried to work through what had happened at the end, I realized that I couldn't remember what had happened because we aren't shown that pivotal scene. Yes, January is an unreliable narrator but I need the story to be more cohesive for me to be satisfied with the end result.

Her friend and fellow Lady Astronaut Nicole Wargin is thrilled to be one of those pioneer settlers, using her considerable flight and political skills to keep the program on track. But she is less happy that her husband, the Governor of Kansas, is considering a run for President.;4.5 StarsWith each new installment, the Lady Astronauts series just gets better and better. I enjoyed the first two books, but I absolutely loved this third novel. Despite coming from similarly privileged white backgrounds, Nicole was very different than the character than Alma. Nicole was independent and self assured in a way that Alma was not. While this is a character focused series, there was a lot of action in this third volume. The saboteur plot created a mystery that was made even more interesting by being set on the moon. I always appreciate the author's dedication to writing accurate historical and scientific information. I recommend reading the section at the end of the book where the author describes the real science and historical events behind this story.This story tackled so many important topics from vaccinations and infertility. I particularly liked the representation of disordered eating recovery, which was depicted realistic without ever being triggering. I found so much of my life experience in this novel, which only made me love it even more.Needless to say, I absolutely recommend this  series but readers should start back at the beginning with The Calculating Stars in order to fully understand the characters and story.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52381417-the-relentless-moon
The Doors of Eden;Adrian Tchaikovsky;2020;2020;609;3.87;8528;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'LGBT', 'Mystery', 'Adult'];Lee’s best friend went missing on Bodmin Moor, four years ago. She and Mal were chasing rumours of monsters when they found something all too real. Now Mal is back, but where has she been, and who is she working for?When government physicist Kay Amal Khan is attacked, the security services investigate. This leads MI5’s Julian Sabreur deep into terrifying new territory, where he clashes with mysterious agents of an unknown power ­who may or may not be human. And Julian’s only clue is some grainy footage ­– showing a woman who supposedly died on Bodmin Moor.Khan’s extradimensional research was purely theoretical, until she found cracks between our world and countless others. Parallel Earths where monsters live. These cracks are getting wider every day, so who knows what might creep through? Or what will happen when those walls finally come crashing down...;"ARC provided by the publisher—Tor UK—in exchange for an honest review.4.5/5 starsChildren of Time has won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 2016, and Children of Ruin won the “best novel of the year” in The British Science Fiction Association Award a few days ago. Tchaikovsky’s newest work, The Doors of Eden, will definitely continue to win him more prestigious SFF awards in the future.Tchaikovsky has written a LOT of books, and I’ve read only Children of Time and Children of Ruin prior to reading this book. This upcoming statement may not mean too much, but The Doors of Eden triumphed over both Children of Time and Children of Ruin; this novel is, to me, undoubtedly the best book by Tchaikovsky that I’ve read so far.

“We’re here and they trust us.” Mal chuckled. “It’s a million-to-one long shot, and these two desperate lesbians can save the world. Perfect action movie material.” 

Four years ago, Lee and Mal—lovers, and young cryptid hunters—went looking for the Birdmen on Bodmin Moor. Only Lee came back from this hunt; Mal vanished. But four years later, in the present timeline, Lee suddenly receives a phone call from someone that sounded exactly like Mal. What exactly happened that day on the moors that caused Mal’s disappearance? Where has she been for the past four years? These are a very small set of questions that teases the large-scale adventures contained within this standalone. When I first started The Doors of Eden, I didn’t expect that the story would end up reaching the grand scale of events it conceived. What started as a simple disappearance story, eventually leads to parallel worlds, timelines, and worlds-changing conflicts. I guess this shouldn’t have come as a surprise; this is Tchaikovsky, after all. And Tchaikovsky did give us hints and information about in the prologue and interludes that the story would end up becoming this big. But wow, the story executions were really well done.Evolution, biology, diversity, time, science, history, are some of the central themes of The Doors of Eden. I’m not a scientist, but I got the sense that the novel was very well-researched, and most importantly, this book isn’t only about science; it also has heart and emotions. Tchaikovsky uses six—and one interlude narrator—POV to tell this story of exploration, spectacle, and danger. Although half of the main characters took longer than I preferred for me to click with, all the main characters—three of them are LGBT characters, for those who want to know—were fleshed out characters; I found Lee and Mal to be the fastest for me to feel invested in, but I grew to care for the other characters as well the more I progressed through the book. In a way, The Doors of Eden is a large-scale standalone adventure about the fascination with time, worlds, science, cooperation, and saving the world. However, if you’ve read Children of Time or Children of Ruin, you’ll notice that both of those books focus on cooperation as its utmost significance of topic; this applies to The Doors of Eden, too, and I loved it.

 “When you told people they were the inheritors of the world, none of them imagined sharing.” 

The book also felt very well-researched; every “what if” scenario displayed in this book showed that Tchaikovsky took a lot of care to make sure that he gets his world-building right. He kinda has to, the story he’s trying to tell here would be filled with plot holes. The ending—specifically the last 100 pages— was insane and quite frankly superbly written. That’s all I’m gonna say on this; read and find out for yourself. There’s no stopping Tchaikovsky. At the rate and quality of storytelling he produces, he’s guaranteed to win awards annually. The Doors of Eden is an imaginative, wonderful, and cracking adventure filled with hope and excitement. Need to hear more? I’ll close this review with what Tchaikovsky himself has to say about this book:“From a young age I’ve been fascinated by the idea of deep time, the millions of years of life that passed before ever a human eye opened to examine the world. I’ve been fascinated, too, by all the many ‘What if?’ scenarios inherent in that span of time. I’ve been inspired by books like Stephen J. Gould’s Wonderful Life and Dougal Dixon’s After Man, looking at the process of evolution and asking ‘Did it have to go this way?’The Doors of Eden takes the evolutionary world-building I used for Children of Time and Children of Ruin and applies it to all the ‘What ifs’ of the past. It’s a book that feeds on a lot of my personal obsessions (not just spiders*). The universe-building is perhaps the broadest in scope of anything I’ve ever written. At the same time, The Doors of Eden is a book set in the here and now, and even though there’s more than one ‘here and now’ in the book, I spent most of a summer trekking around researching locations like a film producer to try and get things as right as possible. Sometimes, when you plan a journey into the very strange, it works best if you start somewhere familiar.Writing the book turned into a very personal journey, for me. It’s the culmination of a lot of ideas that have been brewing away at the back of my mind, and a lot of obsessions that have had hold of me for decades. I have quite the trip in store for readers, I hope.”—Adrian Tchaikovsky on The Doors of EdenLastly, do remember that this is Tchaikovsky’s book, you might as well prepare yourself to meet terrifying creatures. And spiders.Official release date: 4th August 2020You can order the book from: Amazon UK | Amazon US | Book Depository (Free shipping)The quotes in this review were taken from an ARC and are subject to change upon publication.You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons on Patreon for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Devin, Hamad, Joie, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48643567-the-doors-of-eden
Eversion;Alastair Reynolds;2022;2020;304;3.98;8491;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fantasy'];From the master of the space opera comes a dark, mind-bending adventure spread across time and space, where Doctor Silas Coade is tasked with keeping his crew safe as they adventure across the galaxy in search of a mysterious artifact.In the 1800s, a sailing ship crashes off the coast of Norway. In the 1900s, a Zepellin explores an icy canyon in Antarctica. In the far future, a spaceship sets out for an alien artifact. Each excursion goes horribly wrong. And on every journey, Dr. Silas Coade is the physician, but only Silas seems to realize that these events keep repeating themselves. And it's up to him to figure out why and how. And how to stop it all from happening again.;"“A ship is a dream of whispers, the dead man said. Whispers and dreams. So I dreamed.”
I’ve been familiar with Alastair Reynolds through his epic high-tech Revelation Space universe. Well, this is nothing like that. This starts more like if “Moby Dick” (but an interesting version of it) had a literary baby with “Groundhog Day” while cheating on Jules Verne — but don’t worry, there will still be science fiction to come, although certainly not as space opera. But you still get to travel through time and space, on sailboats and steamboats and dirigibles and spaceships. The plot is a puzzle and a quest and an adventure, and even if a savvy reader manages to figure out what’s going on before the reveals, it’s still very much worth it and very clever. Nothing is as it seems.And I loved it.Alastair Reynolds is a very good writer. There is something crisply precise about his writing, even when stylized along the 19th century lines with a steampunk flavoring and a set of what seem to be alternate realities, all converging into a story that makes sense despite initial touch of confusion. It’s odd and weird and compelling, a story of denial and acceptance, friendship and hard ethical choices. A mind unraveling under pressure, forced to make choices that cause pain no matter how you look at that. Humanity, personhood, self-delusion, the question of what being alive means — all this is touched upon and is unexpectedly poignant.I loved it. And I’m certainly planning to catch up with Reynolds’ back catalog since he seems to be consistently good.4.5 stars.——————Thanks to NetGalley and Orbit Books for providing me with a digital ARC in exchange for an honest review.——————Also posted on my blog.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58727132-eversion

The next time Nia's ship arrives, Kaeda convinces her to take the boy, sending with him the small flute of which he's enamored, the very same flute Nia had gifted Kaeda when he himself was a small boy.We are then taken back in time to get to know Fumiko Nakajima, one of earth's most brilliant scientists. It is Fumiko who helped humans leave a dying earth by designing space worlds for them to inhabit and who in effect helped colonise the galaxies. I loved her character and Nia's. I loved that the two main characters were not just strong, intelligent women, but minorities as well. Nia is Black and Fumiko is lesbian. Hell yeh! And thankfully there weren't any stereotypes attached to either of these characters.I won't write more about the plot; you can read the book's synopsis to learn more - or the book itself which is what I would recommend.  I'll just add that the story is a mystery of sorts, a love story of sorts, a centuries-long saga spanning many galaxies and star systems. There is love and hate and revenge and an evil corporation. There are deep friendships and old enemies. And at its heart this is a story of family, the people we are most connected to whether or not we share blood, of the people we always long to return to. The prose is gorgeous. Exquisite. From page one I was entranced. There is not one thing I did not like about this book and that says a lot. I don't even care that there wasn't much science in this though normally I am disappointed with science fiction sans science. I wish I could give this 10 stars instead of 5. It is a masterpiece and Simon Jimenez is an author I will be eagerly awaiting another novel by. Incredible. Absolutely incredible.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45422268-the-vanished-birds

Tennal, like all neuromodified “readers,” is a security threat on his own. But when controlled, readers are a rare asset. Not only can they read minds, but they can navigate chaotic space, the maelstroms surrounding the gateway to the wider universe.Conscripted into the military under dubious circumstances, Tennal is placed into the care of Lieutenant Surit Yeni, a duty-bound soldier, principled leader, and the son of a notorious traitor general. Whereas Tennal can read minds, Surit can influence them. Like all other neuromodified “architects,” he can impose his will onto others, and he’s under orders to control Tennal by merging their minds.Surit accepted a suspicious promotion-track request out of desperation, but he refuses to go through with his illegal orders to sync and control an unconsenting Tennal. So they They fake a sync bond and plan Tennal's escape.Their best chance arrives with a salvage-retrieval mission into chaotic space―to the very neuromodifcation lab that Surit's traitor mother destroyed twenty years ago. And among the rubble is a treasure both terrible and unimaginably powerful, one that upends a decades-old power struggle, and begins a war.Tennal and Surit can no longer abandon their unit or their world.

If you're primarily an SF reader you'll probably think it has a lot of romance. I'd categorise this one as slightly more on the SF side of the SF/Romance border.

To her, these initials have always stood for Artificial Organism. AO has never really felt...natural, and that's putting it lightly. Her parents spent most of the days before she was born praying for her peaceful passing because even in-utero she was wrong. But she lived. Then came the car accident years later that disabled her even further. Yet instead of viewing her strange body the way the world views it, as freakish, unnatural, even the work of the devil, AO embraces all that she is: A woman with a ton of major and necessary body augmentations. And then one day she goes to her local market and everything goes wrong.Once on the run, she meets a Fulani herdsman named DNA and the race against time across the deserts of Northern Nigeria begins. In a world where all things are streamed, everyone is watching the reckoning of the murderess and the terrorist and the saga of the wicked woman and mad man unfold. This fast-paced, relentless journey of tribe, destiny, body, and the wonderland of technology revels in the fact that the future sometimes isn't so predictable. Expect the unaccepted.;A novel that is once meditative and riveting. AO is a Nigerian woman with cybernetic body parts who is forced on the run after a violent incident. She heads into the desert running away from the life she knew and in that great unknown she meets DNA, a desert-dwelling herdsman who is also running from something. Together they must find a way to defend themselves against all kinds of threats and their journey is intriguing, perilous, emotional and powerful. AO and DNA are interesting characters and AO is well-developed. As she evolves over the course of the novel, I was increasingly invested in her fate.

Station Eternity;Mur Lafferty;2022;2020;457;3.7;6703;yes;['Mystery', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Space', 'Audiobook', 'Adult'];Amateur detective Mallory Viridian’s talent for solving murders ruined her life on Earth and drove her to live on an alien space station, but her problems still follow her in this witty, self-aware novel that puts a speculative spin on murder mysteries, from the Hugo-nominated author of Six Wakes.From idyllic small towns to claustrophobic urban landscapes, Mallory Viridian is constantly embroiled in murder cases that only she has the insight to solve. But outside of a classic mystery novel, being surrounded by death doesn’t make you a charming amateur detective, it makes you a suspect and a social pariah. So when Mallory gets the opportunity to take refuge on a sentient space station, she thinks she has the solution. Surely the murders will stop if her only company is alien beings. At first her new existence is peacefully quiet...and markedly devoid of homicide.But when the station agrees to allow additional human guests, Mallory knows the break from her peculiar reality is over. After the first Earth shuttle arrives, and aliens and humans alike begin to die, the station is thrown into peril. Stuck smack-dab in the middle of an extraterrestrial whodunit, and wondering how in the world this keeps happening to her anyway, Mallory has to solve the crime—and fast—or the list of victims could grow to include everyone on board…;"Station Eternity by Mur LaffertyIt's not too far into the future and Earth has had First Contact which leads humans to meeting several species, all who are more advanced and less ""watery"" than humans. Most of these species can have a symbiotic relationship with another species and even their space ships are alive. It seems that these new beings can come and go to our planet but humans aren't allowed the same freedom, probably because they are less advanced than the other species. Since she was young, murders have happened around Mallory Viridian. She's connected to them in some way, and she is the only one who can solve them. This gives her a not so good reputation and after about the fourteenth murder she escapes to an alien space station where she will be the only one of two humans (oops, make that one of three humans). Still, being so far away from earth, with just three humans but lots of other species, will give Mallory peace and probably prevent more murders from happening. But when a human shuttle almost arrives at the space station, threatening to ruin Mallory's almost exile from humans, the space station, the shuttle, and Mallory's life explode into chaos. What ensures was extremely hard for me to follow, especially since we see things from a lot different POVs. Beings, whose names we have come to know through Mallory or other characters, aren't called by their names by characters that don't know them and I would get very confused about who was being discussed. I'd also get confused when certain beings were talking to each other. Yes, there are communications problems between the less advanced humans, the other beings, and the translation modules but I do wish things weren't so confusing for me. Amongst the chaos, distrust, the murder of the non human ""host"" of the ship, and a lot of other death, I had trouble connecting to the characters. I did best with the humans since I could usually understand what they were talking about except that each of them seemed to have one or more secrets so they weren't forthcoming about their pasts and their motivations. Overall, this seems to be a murderous bunch and no one is safe, especially since the station is in the process of having a mental and physical breakdown. This murder mystery is just too complex and chaotic for me to understand very well.

The enigmatic Investigator Mossa follows his trail to Valdegeld, home to the colony’s erudite university—and Mossa’s former girlfriend, a scholar of Earth’s pre-collapse ecosystems.Pleiti has dedicated her research and her career to aiding the larger effort towards a possible return to Earth.

Humanity, having wrecked Earth, has moved to a gas giant, where people live on platforms off great planet-spanning rails. It's a wonderful concept, delivered vividly, and I loved the gaslamp-fantasy feel of the university and the trains rattling around the loops. We also have a lovely f/f Holmes and Watson, the not-good-at-feels investigator Mossa and the academic Pleiti, her college ex-girlfriend. A magnificently imaginative setting, a nicely developed and satisfyingly resolved mystery, a beautifully understated central romance, and a lot of thought-provoking ideas make this an immensely satisfying read.

The Spare Man;Mary Robinette Kowal;2022;2020;368;3.75;6453;no;['Mystery', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Space', 'Audiobook', 'Adult'];Tesla Crane, a brilliant inventor and an heiress, is on her honeymoon on an interplanetary space liner, cruising between the Moon and Mars. She’s traveling incognito and is reveling in her anonymity. Then someone is murdered and the festering chowderheads who run security have the audacity to arrest her spouse. Armed with banter, martinis and her small service dog, Tesla is determined to solve the crime so that the newlyweds can get back to canoodling—and keep the real killer from striking again.;"A locked spaceship murder mystery with an obscenely rich heiress on her honeymoon and chapters starting with cocktail recipes. A lot of money and glitz and alcohol, and rich people being rich. Yeah. It’s a beach read in space to which I’m apparently indifferent.It’s not fun when the satisfaction of seeing the protagonist intimidate the bad guys gets immediately ruined when you realize that the intimidation is accomplished through money and social status and basically screaming “Do you know who I am?!” in the most entitled privileged fashion without any doubt that it will work. Because money bullies everyone. Because for every obstacle in her way Tesla has a solution of either (1) tip too much, (2) show off her supposedly adorable dog, (3) speak condescendingly to those “below” her on the social ladder and (4) intimidate her way into getting what she wants while (5) demanding to speak to the manager. She expects the world to bend to her influence — and it always does. So whether Tesla is in the right or not, I just was hoping to see that smug self-satisfaction wiped off her extra-rich face once and for all. 

In the middle of a murder investigation my heart just doesn’t bleed if this Tesla lady gets downgraded to a room that’s not a suite and gets subpar cocktails. Oh, and I’m that stone-hearted bitch that does not immediately go all “awwwwww” no matter how cute the protagonist’s dog is. I’m a pet rock person, ok? I’m immune to literary dog cuteness. (Also, it’s one of those books where if you’re not immediately going gaga over a dog running towards you then you’re probably a killer or an accomplice, and my natural response to strange dogs - caution and not blind trust in the “the puppy doesn’t bite” reassurance - would have made me suspect number one). Oh, and while we are on dog subject, Tesla really messes with the protocol for service dogs, and it seems habitual and annoying.
 “It did make me pause to think, because she is correct that anyone who is not charmed by that absurdly cute wee doglet is somewhat suspect.”Yup, I was right.After the first few pages I was hoping it’d be a parody of the lifestyle of the rich and famous, but it seems to be pretty seriously done. But it turns out that my tolerance of hanging out with rude spoiled privileged judgmental people who bask in the security of their gagillions of currency units is limited. I would have preferred a viewpoint of someone working on that luxury spaceship, talking crap about the spoiled patrons. And I would have preferred for the mystery to be solved with brains and not status-based intimidation. (And while I’m at it, would be nice if the rich couple did not screw with the investigation by an actually competent professional just because they can).
 “I know you make an effort to be conscious of your privilege, but … you’re doing a lot of running roughshod over people right now.” “They arrested you. They beat you.” Her cheeks were hot with embarrassment or anger, and she stalked away from him to the vanity. “That’s what privilege is for. Fighting people who are abusing their power.”Except that you’re doing just that yourself, the abuse of power. Hypocrite much?2 irritated stars.——————Also posted on my blog.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55077658-the-spare-man
The Road to Roswell;Connie Willis;2023;2020;399;3.74;6099;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Romance', 'Aliens', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy'];A delightful novel about alien invasions, conspiracies, and the incredibly silly things people are willing to believe—some of which may actually be true—from the Nebula and Hugo award-winning author of Blackout and All ClearWhen level-headed Francie arrives in Roswell, New Mexico, for her college roommate’s UFO-themed wedding—complete with a true-believer bridegroom—she can’t help but roll her eyes at all the wide-eyed talk of aliens, which obviously don’t exist. Imagine her surprise, then, when she is abducted by one.Odder still, her abductor is far from what the popular media have led her to expect, with a body like a tumbleweed and a mass of lightning-fast tentacles. Nor is Francie the only victim of the alien’s abduction spree. Before long, he has acquired a charming con man named Wade, a sweet little old lady with a casino addiction, a retiree with a huge RV and a love for old Westerns, and a UFO-chasing nutjob who is thoroughly convinced the alien intends to probe them and/or take over the planet.But the more Francie gets to know the alien, the more convinced she becomes that he’s not an invader. That he’s in trouble and she has to help him. Only she doesn’t know how—or even what the trouble is. Part alien-abduction adventure, part road trip saga, part romantic comedy, The Road to Roswell is packed full of Men in Black, Elvis impersonators, tourist traps, rattlesnakes, chemtrails, and Close Encounters of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth kind. Can Francie, stuck in a neon green bridesmaid’s dress, save the world—and still make it back for the wedding?;3.5 starsAt its best, The Road to Roswell is a fun, madcap alien road trip. But at its worst, its page after page of endless dialogue.I’m serious. That’s pretty much all the book is. And even though the dialogue is entertaining – Connie Willis is a clever and witty lady – there’s not much else sandwiched between it to give the story substance.But Roswell does have its moments. As the adorable alien, Indy, snatches up one innocent bystander after another, forcing them to join his road-trip quest, you can’t help but smile in amusement. It’s a ragtag group he gathers, and Francie and Wade and all the other sidekicks are just as charming as Indy. The story itself is appealing, too, because it has something for everyone: adventure, romance, humor, and heart.I only wish Willis had put more into the narrative to occupy my mind. Dialogue is important, sure, but when it’s the only thing an author gives me, the book feels long and I tire of the nonstop talking in my head.I’ll be back for Book #2, though, since Willis does a good job of NOT wrapping things up. No way will I miss out on more Indy and the gang.My sincerest appreciation to Connie Willis, Del Rey, and NetGalley for the digital review copy.

The Terraformers;Annalee Newitz;2023;2020;338;3.36;5816;no;['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Speculative Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Queer'];Destry is a top network analyst with the Environmental Rescue Team, an ancient organization devoted to preventing ecosystem collapse. On the planet Sask-E, her mission is to terraform an Earthlike world, with the help of her taciturn moose, Whistle. But then she discovers a city that isn't supposed to exist, hidden inside a massive volcano. Torn between loyalty to the ERT and the truth of the planet's history, Destry makes a decision that echoes down the generations.Centuries later, Destry's protege, Misha, is building a planetwide transit system when his worldview is turned upside-down by Sulfur, a brilliant engineer from the volcano city. Together, they uncover a dark secret about the real estate company that's buying up huge swaths of the planet―a secret that could destroy the lives of everyone who isn't Homo sapiens. Working with a team of robots, naked mole rats, and a very angry cyborg cow, they quietly sow seeds of subversion. But when they're threatened with violent diaspora, Misha and Sulfur's very unusual child faces a stark choice: deploy a planet-altering weapon, or watch their people lose everything they've built on Sask-E.;"2.5 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2023/02/03/...I wanted to like The Terraformers a lot more than I did. Needless to say, the premise, having been compared to the works of Becky Chambers and Martha Wells, immediately caught my attention. However, when taken as a whole, the execution of the novel made it a challenging one to embrace.The story first starts by following Destry, a top network analyst working for the Environmental Rescue Team on the Earth-like planet Sask-E. Vat-grown specifically to perform her job, Destry’s duties include patrolling the surface of the planet overseeing terraforming efforts while riding on a bio-robotic moose mount named Whistle. So far, so awesome. But then Destry and her colleagues stumble upon a city hidden deep inside a volcano—a city that, if discovered by her superiors, would have deadly repercussions for everyone o Sask-E. Caught at a crossroads, Destry ultimately makes a choice that will ripple across generations and change everything for better or worse.Skip forward then to hundreds of years later, the focus suddenly switches to a whole new direction. This first time jump was what started me down the path of disillusionment, realizing that not everything is as good as I believed it to be. It didn’t help that the author made me care about the characters and the scenario in the introduction, creating entire lives and histories, only to then turn around and pull the rug from under me, snatching me away from all the things I’d inevitably grown attached to. How rude!Up to this point, the story had sensation of being heavily stage-managed, nothing really occurring organically, instead relying on character tropes and feel-good cliches—which wasn’t exactly a negative point against it. In fact, the vibes worked quite well for the lighthearted Wayfarers-type atmosphere and tone the novel was trying to establish. But the problem again arose with the abrupt and unceremonious way we were ripped from the first timeline, essentially hitting a reset button, and I was decidedly NOT as patient and forgiving the second time around. Almost immediately, characterization took a nosedive; for the rest of the book, I struggled to connect with anyone else for they all came across as either an embodiment of idealized goodness or pure depravity with no middle ground.The tragedy of course is that The Terraformers contains much deeper ideas about environmental conservation, the concept of intelligence and what defines it, along with other such thought-provoking themes—even if the narrative sometimes goes about it in some goofy ass ways. Also, when they weren’t completely nonsensical, some of the messages in the book were laid on a bit too thick for my tastes. Still, in the end, none of it mattered anyway, because all of it was lost in the noise.I honestly believe I would have enjoyed this novel more had it not been so frustrating. There were moments that truly shone, such as the first third of the book. Then there were the world-building elements involved, like the terraforming processes and engineered creatures, which were all very fascinating. The first section featuring Destry would have made an excellent standalone novella, for instance, or it could have been expanded into a more impactful novel. Instead, what The Terraformers ended up being was more like a collection of ideas cobbled together without a plot or focus to drive it. What ultimately made this book a middle-of-the-road read for me was its failure to pull it all together coherently, or for a overarching story to fully materialize. Rated 2.5 stars for potential unrealized.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784471-the-terraformers

Soon a sinister mystery unfolds aboard the gigantic vessel, one that will have repercussions for the entire system—from the scheming politicians of Lagos station, to the colony planet Bloodroot, to other far-flung systems, and indeed to Earth itself.;"It’s disappointing when the book starts with so much promise, but by the end you are just slogging through, constantly checking to see when it will finally be over.Tade Thompson captured my attention with his Rosewater series, and I welcomed this more overt science fiction venture of his, set in space on a giant starship. (I love giant starships — I mean, who doesn’t???)
 “Nobody trained her for this. Astronaut training anticipates everything one can reasonably expect to come across. A killing spree is not reasonable. A murderer on board is not reasonable.And the murderer is still on the ship.”
The set-up is great — a “locked room” murder mystery set on a spaceship. Michelle “Shell” Campion is the first mate to the Captain AI on the starship Ragtime that ferries a thousand passengers in suspended animation to the colony planet Bloodroot. (No, I’m not sure why the names are so odd, but there’s also a mention of the failed colony Nightshade). But when Shell wakes up in the orbit of Bloodroot, she finds out that the AI is mostly out of commission and there’s trouble (and a wolf) on board:
“The disposal unit is thirty minutes away. As soon as Shell enters, she sees the problem.The entire space is filled with the chopped-up bodies of passengers.” Joined by Fin, a Bloodroot “repatriator” (basically he send aliens back to their spacetime dimension or something), and his “Artificial” Salvo, and later by a couple of people from the nearby space station Lagos, Shell is trying to figure out what the hell happened here — and as the things on the ship go terribly awry, they switch their priorities to mere survival. And yes, there just may be a rogue AI, but less obviously telegraphed than this set-up suggests.
“If personhood can be contemplated, why not malfunctioning personhood?”
There was quite a bit of fun to be had here, with this set-up. And indeed for the first third I pretty much loved it all. Rather than a locked room mystery in space it became more of a haunted house in space, and I got a kick out of the creepy vibe and the breakneck speed with pretty relentless pacing that feels deliberately urgent, and clipped short scenes that matched the clipped “staccato” narration (to borrow my buddy reader Dylan’s phrasing here). 
“So many ways to die on the Ragtime, so little time.”
——————But the strong start started to fizzle out as the book progressed.I love complex stories and ideas, and Thompson definitely does not shy away from introducing more and more plot threads even well into the second half of the story — but in order to be truly successful with that you need to be able to still remain focused. What this story suffers from, however, is unfocused execution, with plot threads sometimes making a messy tangle rather than a well-constructed pattern. It often seemed to be a bit of a literary casserole concocted of bits of everything, even oversalted too-lumpy potatoes.
“Salvo says, “Who are we fighting?”“Space pirates,” says Shell. “Lagos space pirates. Mutants hiding in the service ducts. Diseased Earthmen hiding in service ducts. Rogue AIs. Fucking Ragtime’s robots. I don’t know, take your pick. We were just knocked out of the sky by a demon AI that possessed our ship.”“Um, are we worried that we’ve seeded experimental organisms into this biosphere?” says Joké.“I can’t worry about that right now,” says Shell.“That’s how it happens, you know. Nobody worries until it’s too late,” says Joké.”
 —————— 
Some more annoyances, in no particular order:- The aliens — I found the reveal quite disappointing, and Joké annoyed the daylights out of me with her endless magical whimsy and “Um” utterances.- The wolf — for all the buildup, what did it matter? But it does look good on the cover.- Fin and Joké — at the breakneck speed of the plot I just fail to see any grounds for any meaningful connection, except that apparently flirting with Shell got her nowhere, so she turned to the next human not related to her.- The ultimate goal of the rogue AI? Yeah, I’m underwhelmed as well.- The random half a page of dream demon sex among lava — yes, that’s straight out of Rosewater playbook.- The characters are not quite fleshed out, and besides Shell I could not care much if they lived or died — even Salvo who got the short stick in the whole story.- Oh, and Shell — it really wasn’t Ragtime’s fault any more than yours, so get off your high horse.—————And so by the time we reached the last third of the book I realized that I don’t really care much about how it ends, and “why’s” and “how’s” of the initial plot ended up mostly irrelevant. I liked the ambiguity of the interpretation of the supposed antagonist’s actions (Shell cannot view him in the positive light regardless of the motives or justification of his initial plan because the ultimate carrying out of that plot led to the carnage of the innocents) but it did not outweigh the overall feeling of tired indifference about the outcome as my interest slowly waned by the end. And when it all ended up a bit unfinished, I did not care all that much.So instead for rogue AI try  Murderbot books; for truly weird aliens try Embassytown; for weird stuff on a starship try Non-Stop; for a better Tade Thompson book with more demon sex try Rosewater.2.5 stars, rounding up down - because a few days later I’m even more irritated by it than I was when I finished it.——————Buddy read with Carol, Dylan and Stephen.";https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57007657-far-from-the-light-of-heaven
