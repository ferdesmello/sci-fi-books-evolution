Brave New World;Aldous Huxley;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World;1932;3.99;1901472;['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'School'];"Aldous Huxley's profoundly important classic of world literature, Brave New World is a searching vision of an unequal, technologically-advanced future where humans are genetically bred, socially indoctrinated, and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian ruling order–all at the cost of our freedom, full humanity, and perhaps also our souls. “A genius [who] who spent his life decrying the onward march of the Machine” (The New Yorker), Huxley was a man of incomparable talents: equally an artist, a spiritual seeker, and one of history’s keenest observers of human nature and civilization. Brave New World, his masterpiece, has enthralled and terrified millions of readers, and retains its urgent relevance to this day as both a warning to be heeded as we head into tomorrow and as thought-provoking, satisfying work of literature. Written in the shadow of the rise of fascism during the 1930s, Brave New Worldd likewise speaks to a 21st-century world dominated by mass-entertainment, technology, medicine and pharmaceuticals, the arts of persuasion, and the hidden influence of elites. ""Aldous Huxley is the greatest 20th century writer in English."" —Chicago Tribune"

Clarke of Last and First Men. This masterpiece of science fiction by British philosopher and writer Olaf Stapledon (1886–1950) is an imaginative, ambitious history of humanity's future that spans billions of years. Together with its follow-up, Star Maker, it is regarded as the standard by which all earlier and later future histories are measured.The protagonist of this compelling novel is humanity itself, stripped down to sheer intelligence. It evolves through the ages: rising to pinnacles of civilization, teetering on the brink of extinction, surviving onslaughts from other planets and a decline in solar energy, and constantly developing new forms, new senses, and new intellectual abilities. From the present to five billion years into the future, this romance of humanity abounds in profound and imaginative thought."

Weinbaum originally published in the July 1934 issue of Wonder Stories. It was Weinbaum's second published story (in 1933 he had sold a romantic novel, The Lady Dances, to King Features Syndicate under the pseudonym Marge Stanley), and remains his best known. It was followed four months later by a sequel, ""Valley of Dreams."" These are the only stories by Weinbaum set on Mars. Early in the 21st century, nearly twenty years after the invention of atomic power and ten years after the first lunar landing, the four-man crew of the Ares has landed on Mars in the Mare Cimmerium. A week after the landing, Dick Jarvis, the ship's American chemist, sets out south in an auxiliary rocket to photograph the landscape. Eight hundred miles out, the engine on Jarvis' rocket gives out, and he crash-lands into one of the Thyle regions. Rather than sit and wait for rescue, Jarvis decides to walk back north to the Ares. Just after crossing into the Mare Chronium, Jarvis comes across a tentacled Martian creature attacking a large birdlike creature. He notices that the birdlike Martian is carrying a bag around its neck, and recognizing it as an intelligent being, saves it from the tentacled monstrosity. The rescued creature refers to itself as Tweel. Tweel accompanies Jarvis on his trip back to the Ares, in the course of which it manages to pick up some English, although Jarvis is unable to make any sense of Tweel's language. At first, Tweel travels in tremendous, city-block-long leaps that end with its long beak buried in the ground, but upon seeing Jarvis trudge along, walks beside him. Upon reaching Xanthus, a desert region outside the Mare Cimmerium, Jarvis and Tweel find a line of small pyramids tens of thousands of years old made of silica bricks, each open at the top. As they follow the line, the pyramids slowly become larger and newer. By the time the pyramids are ten feet high, the travelers reach the end of the line and find a pyramid that is not open at the top. As they watch, a creature with gray scales, one arm, a mouth and a pointed tail pushes its way out of the top of the pyramid, pulls itself several yards along the ground, then plants itself in the ground by the tail. It starts exhaling bricks from its mouth at ten-minute intervals and using them to build another pyramid around itself. Jarvis realizes that the creature is silicon-based rather than carbon-based; neither animal, vegetable nor mineral, but a little of each. The strange combination of a creature produces the solid substance silica and builds itself in with the by-product, then sleeps for an unknown length of time. As the two approach a canal cutting across Xanthus, Jarvis is feeling homesick for New York City, thinking about Fancy Long, a woman he knows from the cast of the Yerba Mate Hour show. When he sees Long standing by the canal, he begins to approach her, but is stopped by Tweel. Tweel takes out a gun that fires poisoned glass needles and shoots Long, who vanishes, replaced by one of the tentacled creatures that Jarvis rescued Tweel from at their first meeting. Jarvis realizes that the tentacled creature, which he names a dream-beast, lures its prey by projecting illusions into their minds."

The next, he is whirling through the firmament, and perhaps the most remarkable of all science fiction journeys has begun.Even Stapledon's other great work, LAST AND FIRST MEN, pales in ambition next to STAR MAKER, which presents nothing less than an entire imagined history of life in the universe, encompassing billions of years.

In a loveless world, he dared to love the woman of his choice. In an age that had lost all trace of science and civilization, he had the courage to seek and find knowledge. But these were not the crimes for which he would be hunted. He was marked for death because he had committed the unpardonable sin: He had stood forth from the mindless human herd. He was a man alone. He had rediscovered the lost and holy word—I.""I worship individuals for their highest possibilities as individuals, and I loathe humanity, for its failure to live up to these possibilities."" —Ayn Rand"

A cipher. A disaffected, vaguely idealistic politician in a nameless media-driven modern state where representative politics has dwindled to the corrupt transaction of business as usual and a new foreign war is always breaking out. One night Gifford and his followers seize some radio stations and broadcast a call for freedom—a rebellion that is immediately put down by the government and whose motive will remain forever obscure. Even so, it leads to twenty years of war.A paranoid tour de force of political noir, Clark Gifford’s Body skips back and forth in time, interspersing newspaper clippings and court transcripts with the reactions and reminiscences of the politicians, generals, businessmen, journalists, waiters, and soldiers who double as the actors and the chorus in a drama over which, finally, they have no control. Who here is leading? Who is being led? Fearing’s novel is a pseudo-documentary of a world given over to pseudo-politics and pseudo-events, a prophetic glimpse of the future as a poisonous fog.“I have not developed the habit of reading thrillers, but I have read enough of them to know that from now on Mr. Fearing is my man.”–The New Yorker

Conan the Cimmerian stared out over the aching desolation and involuntarily drew the back of his powerful hand over his blackened lips. He stood like a bronze image in the sand, apparently impervious to the murderous sun, though his only garment was a silk loin-cloth, girdled by a wide gold-buckled belt from which hung a saber and a broad-bladed poniard. On his clean-cut limbs were evidences of scarcely healed wounds.At his feet rested a girl, one white arm clasping his knee, against which her blond head drooped. Her white skin contrasted with his hard bronzed limbs; her short silken tunic, low-necked and sleeveless, girdled at the waist, emphasized rather than concealed her lithe figure.Conan shook his head, blinking. The sun's glare half blinded him. He lifted a small canteen from his belt and shook it, scowling at the faint splashing within.The girl moved wearily, whimpering.""Oh, Conan, we shall die here! I am so thirsty!""The Cimmerian growled wordlessly, glaring truculently at the surrounding waste, with outthrust jaw, and blue eyes smoldering savagely from under his black tousled mane, as if the desert were a tangible enemy.He stooped and put the canteen to the girl's lips.""Drink till I tell you to stop, Natala,"" he commanded.She drank with little panting gasps, and he did not check her. Only when the canteen was empty did she realize that he had deliberately allowed her to drink all their water supply, little enough that it was.Tears sprang to her eyes. ""Oh, Conan,"" she wailed, wringing her hands, ""why did you let me drink it all? I did not know--now there is none for you!""""Hush,"" he growled. ""Don't waste your strength in weeping.""Straightening, he threw the canteen from him.""Why did you do that?"" she whispered.More In The 'Conan' Stories Series by ADB Publishing(The Original) The Phoenix on the Sword (1932)(The Original) The Scarlet Citadel (1933)(The Original) The Tower of the Elephant (1933)(The Original) Black Colossus (1933)(The Original) The Slithering Shadow (1933) (This Book)(The Original) The Pool of the Black One (1933)(The Original) Gods of the North (1934)(The Original) Rogues in the House (1934)(The Original) Shadows in the Moonlight (1934)(The Original) Queen of the Black Coast (1934)(The Original) The Devil in Iron (1934)(The Original) The People of the Black Circle (1934)(The Original) A Witch Shall be Born(1934)(The Original) Jewels of Gwahlur (1935)(The Original) Beyond the Black River (1935)(The Original) Shadows in Zamboula (1935)(The Original) Red Nails (1936)(The Original) The Hour of the Dragon (novel) (1936)(The Original) The Hyborian Age (1938)"

He is well known for having created the character Conan the Cimmerian, a literary icon whose pop-culture imprint can be compared to such icons as Tarzan of the Apes, Sherlock Holmes, and James Bond. Voracious reading, along with a natural talent for prose writing and the encouragement of teachers, conspired to create in Howard an interest in becoming a professional writer. One by one he discovered the authors that would influence his later work: Jack London and Rudyard Kipling. It's clear from Howard's earliest writings and the recollections of his friends that he suffered from severe depression from an early age. Friends recall him defending the act of suicide as a valid alternative as early as eighteen years old, while many of his stories and poems have a suicidal gloom and intensity that seem prescient in hindsight, describing such an end not as a tragedy but as a release from hell on earth.

Befriended by a local cat-man, he becomes acquainted in all aspects of cat-life: he learns to speak Felinese, masters cat-poetry, and appreciates the narcotic effects of the reverie leaf – their food staple. But curiosity turns to despair when he ventures further into the heart of the country and the culture, and realizes that he is witnessing the bleak decline of a civilization. Cat Country, Lao She's only work of science fiction, is both a dark, dystopian tale of one man's close encounter with the feline kind and a scathing indictment of a country gone awry.

Beaucoup de livres pour un sujet aussi crucial, mais dans le lot peu de chefs-d’oeuvre... Quinzinzinzili, ce roman au titre improbable, est pourtant de ceux-là, ses rares lecteurs n’en démordent pas, qui s’étonnent toujours de son ironie visionnaire, de son pessimisme halluciné et de ses trouvailles géniales. Publié en 1935, il a été imaginé par Régis Messac (1893-1945), considéré comme l’un des précurseurs du genre, et nous entraîne après le cataclysme, à la suite du dernier des adultes, témoin stupéfait de la renaissance du genre humain : sous ses yeux désabusés, un groupe d’enfants réinvente une Humanité dont l’Histoire a disparu. Et Messac, qui sait que la Civilisation est mortelle, nous offre le spectacle d’une poignée de gosses en train de lui régler son compte... Stupéfiant, Quinzinzinzili renaît et devrait susciter l’admiration de ceux qui croient davantage aux vertus des Lettres qu’à celles de l’Homme. Formidable précurseur, Régis Messac, né en 1893, fils d’instituteur, qui deviendra enseignant, il est le premier Français à s’être intéressé de près au « roman de détection » — appellation d’époque du polar — , en le portant sur les bancs de l’université avec une thèse qui fait date, « Le »Detective novel« et l’influence de la pensée scientifique », rédigée à son retour d’un long séjour en Amérique du Nord. Auteur prolifique sur une courte période, habile à manier l’anticipation et la chronique sociale, il s’était très tôt rebellé contre un système (on lui doit un pamphlet À bas le latin !) qui le marginalisera. Blessé à la guerre, il est un pacifiste convaincu. Il a une intense activité de critique (il écrit les premiers essais littéraires sur la S.F.), de traducteur et de romancier durant les années 30. Gagné par un pessimisme acide, il imagine des contre-utopies : Quinzinzinzili (1935), La Cité des Asphyxiés (1937) ou le posthume Valcrétin indiquent que rien de l’avenir « messacien » n’est souriant. Motivés par la provocation dont il espère qu’elle conduira à un soubresaut moral (« Où est le bonheur ? Dans l’accord avec son milieu. Si nous vivons parmi les Crétins, soyons crétins. »), ses récits présentent une vue panoramique de sociétés futures ou parallèles. Arrêté par les Allemands en 1943, déporté « Nacht und Nebel », il disparaît en Allemagne en 1945.

Heinlein comes a long-lost first novel, written in 1939, introducing ideas and themes that would shape his career and define the genre that is synonymous with his name. July 12, 1939: Perry Nelson is driving along the palisades when another vehicle swerves into his lane, a tire blows out, and his car careens off the road and over a bluff. The last thing he sees before his head connects with the boulders below is a girl in a green bathing suit, prancing along the shore. When he wakes, the girl in green is a woman dressed in furs, and the sun-drenched shore has been replaced by snowcapped mountains. The woman, Diana, rescues Perry from the bitter cold and takes him to her home to rest and recuperate. Later they debate the cause of the accident, for Diana is unfamiliar with the concept of a tire blowout and Perry cannot comprehend snowfall in mid-July. Then Diana shares with him a vital piece of the date is now January 7, the year 2086. When his shock subsides, Perry begins an exhaustive study of global evolution over the past 150 years. He learns, among other things, that a United Europe was formed; the military draft was completely reconceived; banks became publicly owned and operated; and in the year 2003, two helicopters destroyed Manhattan in a galvanizing act of war. But education brings with it inescapable truths--the economic and legal systems, the government, and even the dynamic between men and women remain alien to Perry, the customs of the new day continually testing his mental and emotional resolve. Yet it is precisely his knowledge of a bygone era that will serve Perry best, as the man from 1939 seems destined to lead his newfound peers even further into the future than they could have imagined. A classic example of the future history that Robert Heinlein popularized during his career, For Us, the Living marks both the beginning and the end of an extraordinary arc comprising the political, social, and literary crusading that is his legacy."

The Hopkins Manuscript;R.C.

It was wonderfully acted and produced, prompting us to search out the author's other work. R C Sherriff (1896-1975) had served in WW1; when he returned to his job as an insurance clerk he wrote plays for his local amateur dramatic club and, eventually, Journey's End, based on his letters home from the Front. During the 1930s he worked in Hollywood, writing screenplays for films such as Goodbye Mr Chips (1933) and The Four Feathers (1938); meanwhile he wrote novels, including A Fortnight in September (1931), which Persephone Books will publish in 2006, and a 1939 catastrophe novel 'written' by 'Edgar Hopkins'.I n The Hopkins Manuscript we watch through his eyes as the moon veers off course, draws slowly closer to the earth, and finally crashes into it on May 3rd 1946. Because it falls into the Atlantic much of humanity survives – only to generate new disasters. But this is not science fiction in the mode of H G Wells's The War of the Worlds; it is a novel about human nature.The 'manuscript' was named after its 'author', a retired Hampshire schoolmaster whose greatest interest in life is his Bantam hens; rather self-important and lacking much sense of humour, Edgar Hopkins nevertheless emerges as an increasingly sympathetic and credible character, the ordinary man with whom we very much identify as Sherriff describes the small Hampshire village trying to prepare itself in its last days. In Journey's End he evoked the trench experience as he had lived it; in The Hopkins Manuscript he describes the catastrophe as he might have lived it.But the book is also a superbly written novel in its own right, one which we are sure readers will find as unforgettable as any of Persephone Books' other titles. We defy anyone not to be overwhelmed by the scene when the villagers staunchly play a last game of cricket by the light of the moon that 'hung like a great amber, pock-marked lamp above a billiard-table, so vast and enveloping that the little white-clad cricketers moved without shadows to their appointed places on the field.'So how did 'the destruction of the Western civilisation' happen?  In 1945 (and there is a wonderful irony that, writing in 1939, Sherriff anticipated that our civilisation might be destroyed then) scientists discovered, during an eclipse of the sun, that the moon was twelve seconds late in its arrival and had drawn nearer to the earth by 3,583 miles; subsequent observations showed that it was continuing to approach at a speed increasing steadily by eight miles a day. Disaster had become inevitable.R C Sherriff made the scientific aspect of The Hopkins Manuscript strangely plausible even though, as Michael Moorcock writes in his Preface, 'he did not believe that there was any immediate likelihood of the moon crashing into the Earth.  We write such books not because we are convinced that they describe the future, but because we hope they do not.' Nonetheless, Sherriff's writing is so convincing that we have added a scientific explanation of the events in the book; this was written by the Big Bang scientist George Gamow for a 1963 US reprint.The reason The Hopkins Manuscript was reprinted then was because of the near-catastrophe of the Cuban Missile Crisis the year before; the previous reprint had been in 1958, at the height of the world's desperate anxieties about the H-Bomb; and the original publication was in the spring of 1939 when many believed that, once war was declared, Hitler would destroy civilisation as they knew it. And the 2005 reprint? The largest threat facing mankind today is global warming. The Hopkins manuscript can be read as a gripping and extremely interesting novel in its own right; but also as a parable of the possibly catastrophic effects of climate change."

Troska patřila na přelomu třicátých a čtyřicátých let k oblíbené četbě mladé generace. Ne nadarmo se J. M. Troskovi začalo říkat ,,český Julius Verne"". Jeho početné romány navazovaly na tradici verneovek a rozvíjely některé základní motivy z románů populárního Francouze, jak je konečně patrné už i z názvu naší trilogie.První díl tohoto dobrodružného a fantastického vyprávění o geniálním kapitánu Nemovi, nazvaný Nemova říše seznámí nejdříve čtenáře s dvojicí českých techniků - inž. Holanem, tvůrcem nezničitelného holanitu, materiálu, který se výborně hodí zejména na stavbu lodí a ponorek, a jeho přítelem inž. Farinem, vynálezcem paprsků smrti a vynikajícím odborníkem v oboru elektřiny. Oba přátelé jsou odhodláni sestrojit ponorku a vydat se v jejích útrobách na výzkum mořského dna. Vypraví se tedy na pustý ostrov kdesi za jižním polárním kruhem a tam v klidu hodlají realizovat svůj záměr. Takřka před začátkem plavby postihne ostrov ničivá sněhová bouře, v níž se ztratí inž. Farin spolu s dalším účastníkem výpravy prof. Rogerem. Oba postižení se za dramatických okolností dostanou do fantastické podzemní říše kapitána Nema, kde mají možnost seznámit se nejen s úžasnými technickými vymoženostmi a samotným kapitáneme Nemo, ake i stát se jeho spolupracovníky. Zatímco Farin a Roger cestují podzemní říší, připravuje inž. Holan svoji plavbu. Těsně před vyplutím bere nad ní záštitu sám kapitán Nemo, který prostřednictvím dokonalé techniky řídí plavbu ponorky, jíž propůjčil čestný název Nautilus, k cíli její cesty, k legendární Atlantidě. Jejím nalezením a vzrušujícími dobrodružstvími při průzkumu končí Nemova říše, první díl populární trilogie Kapitán Nemo, jejímž vydáním splácíme dluh našemu čtenáři i dluh ,,českému Juliu Vernovi"", spisovateli J.

Podmořským tunelem pluje Nautilus až do Grónska, jedné z Nemových pozemských řídících stanic, svěřené domněle zahynuvšímu polárnímu badateli Roaldu Amundsenovi. A tu do vědeckého pozorování zasahují události, ohrožující světový mír: Farinův přístroj s paprsky smrti je ukraden a jeho vynálezce zavražděn.

Jejich bdělý ochránce kapitán Nemo, který ze své podzemní říše sleduje plavbu lodi Kamako až na Sumatru a je svědkem nelidského činu Farinových vrahů, včas odvrátí tragické rozuzlení: neobyčejně přesným zásahem svého ,,meteoritu"" - tajemným světelným zdrojem s obrovskou ničivou silou - potápí loď Kamako i její zločinnou posádku a zachraňuje Arna a Jiřího. S oběma se setkáváme ve třetím dílu trilogie, nazvaném Neviditelná armáda. Arne se v objetí robota - Nemova létajícího stroje - ocitá na místě, kam před lety zmizel jeho otec inženýr Farin, v říši geniálního vládce Nema. Seznamuje se s jeho vnučkou Nelly, jedinou ženou v podzemní říši, a brzy pracuje jako jeden z Nemových pomocníků. Nemocného Jiřího posílá Nemo inženýru Holanovi. Zdá se, že Arnova přítele čeká dlouholetý pobyt v ústavu choromyslných. Nekolik hodin strávených poblíž sopky Krakatoa stačí k tomu, aby u něho propuklo šílenství. Ale Nemo neopouští své přátele. Použije svých prostředků na zeměkouli dosud neznámých a uzdraví Jiřího. Později mu umožní setkání s Arnem a tak získává dalšího spolupracovníka a ochránce světového míru. Farinovi paprsky už nejsou žádným tajemstvím. Neznámému evropskému vynálezci se podařil stejný objev jako kdysi inženýru Farinovi a účinky smrtících paprsků jsou známy generálskému štábu jisté mocnosti. Aby zabránil blížící se katastrofě, ničí Nemo vynálezcův přístroj. Ale síly připravující novou válku jsou stále nebezpečné. Nemo, teď už spoolečně s Arnem a Jiřím, se rozhoduje k novému, tentokrát rozhodujícímu zákroku. Když nepomáhá první výstraha - zničení nepřátelské flotily, nastupuje jeho neviditelná armáda."

The descendants of the Taberners have farmed the land through the centuries, and to the Taberners of the present day comes Penelope, their great-niece, a sensitive, imaginative girl, who is aware of other layers of time. With her awakened vision she sees people of the past move in their daily tasks among those of the present, and behind the contented life of the household of Cicely and Barnabas Taberner she finds the old tragedy of Anthony Babington and his plot to save Mary, Queen of Scots, being re-enacted. The farm kitchen where Penelope sits with her great-aunt and great-uncle is the home of those others who once lived there. Their desires and fears, their courage and strength enter the girl's mind; their voices float up from the garden and she is caught up into their life. Time is annihilated, and she lives in the closing years of the sixteenth century remembering little of her modern life, until she returns from her traveling in time bearing the anxieties and dreams of the other world. The life of two widely separated times in history - the Elizabethan and the present - goes on simultaneously, each invisible to the other. And only Penelope can pierce the veil, sharing the tumultuous experiences of the Babington family three hundred years ago."

Moore created Jirel, ruler of Joiry, in reaction to the beefy total-testosterone blood-and-thunder tales of '30s pulp magazines, but Jirel is no anti-Conan. She's a good Catholic girl, stubbornly purposeful, relentless in pursuit of enemies or vengeance, hard-boiled and a little stupid, and cannot be distracted by mere physical attractiveness. Indeed, in Jirel's world, beauty = decadence = corruption.

It is a place of frozen wastes, desolation and things best left forgotten. Presented here is the tale of William Dyer, a professor from Miskatonic University and the leader of an ill-fated expedition to that remote and forlorn continent. Recorded in a series of letters, Dyers tells a scarcely believable tale full of anomalous and often horrific events.Dreadful secrets lie beneath the ice, waiting to be discovered. Strange, cyclopean structures squat amidst the mountains towering in the distance, promising only madness to those who dare to explore their alien architecture. The Dyer Expedition ventures further than any other before them, and ultimately pays the price for it.H.P. Lovecraft’s At the Mountains of Madness, first published in 1936, is one of the greatest classics of American horror literature. The most ambitious story Lovecraft ever wrote, it has served as a source of inspirations for filmmakers and authors in the decades since his death. This is the first volume of two.François Baranger, an illustrator who has previously worked in film and games, was fascinated early on by Lovecraft’s creatures and visions which populated the darkest recesses of fantasy. Having previously illustrated The Call of Cthulhu to great acclaim, this book is his most ambitious so far.See volume 2 here.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails."

On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.

Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now…Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, The Handmaid's Tale is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and tour de force."

Slaughterhouse-Five (Paperback);Kurt Vonnegut Jr.;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4981.Slaughterhouse_Five;1969;4.1;1392058;['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'War', 'Literature', 'Novels'];Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it.  Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.
