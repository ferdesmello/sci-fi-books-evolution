Weinbaum originally published in the July 1934 issue of Wonder Stories. It was Weinbaum's second published story (in 1933 he had sold a romantic novel, The Lady Dances, to King Features Syndicate under the pseudonym Marge Stanley), and remains his best known. It was followed four months later by a sequel, \"Valley of Dreams.\" These are the only stories by Weinbaum set on Mars. Early in the 21st century, nearly twenty years after the invention of atomic power and ten years after the first lunar landing, the four-man crew of the Ares has landed on Mars in the Mare Cimmerium. A week after the landing, Dick Jarvis, the ship's American chemist, sets out south in an auxiliary rocket to photograph the landscape. Eight hundred miles out, the engine on Jarvis' rocket gives out, and he crash-lands into one of the Thyle regions. Rather than sit and wait for rescue, Jarvis decides to walk back north to the Ares. Just after crossing into the Mare Chronium, Jarvis comes across a tentacled Martian creature attacking a large birdlike creature. He notices that the birdlike Martian is carrying a bag around its neck, and recognizing it as an intelligent being, saves it from the tentacled monstrosity. The rescued creature refers to itself as Tweel. Tweel accompanies Jarvis on his trip back to the Ares, in the course of which it manages to pick up some English, although Jarvis is unable to make any sense of Tweel's language. At first, Tweel travels in tremendous, city-block-long leaps that end with its long beak buried in the ground, but upon seeing Jarvis trudge along, walks beside him. Upon reaching Xanthus, a desert region outside the Mare Cimmerium, Jarvis and Tweel find a line of small pyramids tens of thousands of years old made of silica bricks, each open at the top. As they follow the line, the pyramids slowly become larger and newer. By the time the pyramids are ten feet high, the travelers reach the end of the line and find a pyramid that is not open at the top. As they watch, a creature with gray scales, one arm, a mouth and a pointed tail pushes its way out of the top of the pyramid, pulls itself several yards along the ground, then plants itself in the ground by the tail. It starts exhaling bricks from its mouth at ten-minute intervals and using them to build another pyramid around itself. Jarvis realizes that the creature is silicon-based rather than carbon-based; neither animal, vegetable nor mineral, but a little of each. The strange combination of a creature produces the solid substance silica and builds itself in with the by-product, then sleeps for an unknown length of time. As the two approach a canal cutting across Xanthus, Jarvis is feeling homesick for New York City, thinking about Fancy Long, a woman he knows from the cast of the Yerba Mate Hour show. When he sees Long standing by the canal, he begins to approach her, but is stopped by Tweel. Tweel takes out a gun that fires poisoned glass needles and shoots Long, who vanishes, replaced by one of the tentacled creatures that Jarvis rescued Tweel from at their first meeting. Jarvis realizes that the tentacled creature, which he names a dream-beast, lures its prey by projecting illusions into their minds.", "ratings": 1495, "title": "A Martian Odyssey", "author": "Stanley G.

Here is the rarely reprinted and highly-acclaimed classic, a stunning mixture of passionate romance and scientific adventure, that The Science Fiction Encyclopedia calls, \"one of the outstanding products of the early sf magazines * an elaborate time-travel adventure which helped extend the horizon of pulp sf.\" Some time in the far past or distant future, in the advanced, scientific world of Eos, which just might be Earth, the woman Cheryl demands the right to marry the man she loves, even though genetic analysis shows any children they produce will have less than desirable genes. In a world of perfect freedom, Cheryl is free to do what she pleases. But then one of her four closest friends discovers that before Eos, an even mightier civilization flourished on their world, one that was destroyed then the \"beast\" was let out in human kind. Her friend thinks this \"beast\" could uncontrolled human passion and warns Cheryl's that her choice might somehow threaten their own world. When she demands proof, her four friends set off on a quest across their planet, and deep into its history and science, in search of answers. But wait, that's not where the story starts. It starts pages earlier, on our Earth, in the 20th century, when a woman who is also named Cheryl and her four friends enter the river of time as part of an experiment whose end they can not foresee. But have they been swept backward or forward? As the stream buffets them, they are sometimes on Eos, sometimes on Earth, sometimes on unnamed worlds that may be the future or the past. On all these worlds Cheryl stands firm for her right to the man she loves, convinced that love shows the right path. But does her intransigence spell the end or the beginning for the human race?

Heinlein comes a long-lost first novel, written in 1939, introducing ideas and themes that would shape his career and define the genre that is synonymous with his name. July 12, 1939: Perry Nelson is driving along the palisades when another vehicle swerves into his lane, a tire blows out, and his car careens off the road and over a bluff. The last thing he sees before his head connects with the boulders below is a girl in a green bathing suit, prancing along the shore. When he wakes, the girl in green is a woman dressed in furs, and the sun-drenched shore has been replaced by snowcapped mountains. The woman, Diana, rescues Perry from the bitter cold and takes him to her home to rest and recuperate. Later they debate the cause of the accident, for Diana is unfamiliar with the concept of a tire blowout and Perry cannot comprehend snowfall in mid-July. Then Diana shares with him a vital piece of the date is now January 7, the year 2086. When his shock subsides, Perry begins an exhaustive study of global evolution over the past 150 years. He learns, among other things, that a United Europe was formed; the military draft was completely reconceived; banks became publicly owned and operated; and in the year 2003, two helicopters destroyed Manhattan in a galvanizing act of war. But education brings with it inescapable truths--the economic and legal systems, the government, and even the dynamic between men and women remain alien to Perry, the customs of the new day continually testing his mental and emotional resolve. Yet it is precisely his knowledge of a bygone era that will serve Perry best, as the man from 1939 seems destined to lead his newfound peers even further into the future than they could have imagined.

It was wonderfully acted and produced, prompting us to search out the author's other work. R C Sherriff (1896-1975) had served in WW1; when he returned to his job as an insurance clerk he wrote plays for his local amateur dramatic club and, eventually, Journey's End, based on his letters home from the Front. During the 1930s he worked in Hollywood, writing screenplays for films such as Goodbye Mr Chips (1933) and The Four Feathers (1938); meanwhile he wrote novels, including A Fortnight in September (1931), which Persephone Books will publish in 2006, and a 1939 catastrophe novel 'written' by 'Edgar Hopkins'.I n The Hopkins Manuscript we watch through his eyes as the moon veers off course, draws slowly closer to the earth, and finally crashes into it on May 3rd 1946. Because it falls into the Atlantic much of humanity survives \u2013 only to generate new disasters. But this is not science fiction in the mode of H G Wells's The War of the Worlds; it is a novel about human nature.The 'manuscript' was named after its 'author', a retired Hampshire schoolmaster whose greatest interest in life is his Bantam hens; rather self-important and lacking much sense of humour, Edgar Hopkins nevertheless emerges as an increasingly sympathetic and credible character, the ordinary man with whom we very much identify as Sherriff describes the small Hampshire village trying to prepare itself in its last days. In Journey's End he evoked the trench experience as he had lived it; in The Hopkins Manuscript he describes the catastrophe as he might have lived it.But the book is also a superbly written novel in its own right, one which we are sure readers will find as unforgettable as any of Persephone Books' other titles. We defy anyone not to be overwhelmed by the scene when the villagers staunchly play a last game of cricket by the light of the moon that 'hung like a great amber, pock-marked lamp above a billiard-table, so vast and enveloping that the little white-clad cricketers moved without shadows to their appointed places on the field.'So how did 'the destruction of the Western civilisation' happen?\u00a0 In 1945 (and there is a wonderful irony that, writing in 1939, Sherriff anticipated that our civilisation might be destroyed then) scientists discovered, during an eclipse of the sun, that the moon was twelve seconds late in its arrival\u00a0and had drawn nearer to the earth by 3,583 miles; subsequent observations showed that it was continuing to approach at a speed increasing steadily by eight miles a day.\u00a0Disaster had become inevitable.R C Sherriff made the scientific aspect of The Hopkins Manuscript strangely plausible even though, as Michael Moorcock writes in his Preface, 'he did not believe that there was any immediate likelihood of the moon crashing into the Earth.\u00a0 We write such books not because we are convinced that they describe the future, but because we hope they do not.' Nonetheless, Sherriff's writing is so convincing that we have added a scientific explanation of the events in the book; this was written by the Big Bang scientist George Gamow for a 1963 US reprint.The reason The Hopkins Manuscript was reprinted then was because of the near-catastrophe of the Cuban Missile Crisis the year before; the previous reprint had been in 1958, at the height of the world's desperate anxieties about the H-Bomb; and the original publication was in the spring of 1939 when many believed that, once war was declared, Hitler would destroy civilisation as they knew it.\u00a0And the 2005 reprint?\u00a0The largest threat facing mankind today is global warming. The Hopkins manuscript can be read as a gripping and extremely interesting novel in its own right; but also as a parable of the possibly catastrophic effects of climate change.", "ratings": 1428, "title": "The Hopkins Manuscript", "author": "R.C.

The descendants of the Taberners have farmed the land through the centuries, and to the Taberners of the present day comes Penelope, their great-niece, a sensitive, imaginative girl, who is aware of other layers of time. With her awakened vision she sees people of the past move in their daily tasks among those of the present, and behind the contented life of the household of Cicely and Barnabas Taberner she finds the old tragedy of Anthony Babington and his plot to save Mary, Queen of Scots, being re-enacted. The farm kitchen where Penelope sits with her great-aunt and great-uncle is the home of those others who once lived there. Their desires and fears, their courage and strength enter the girl's mind; their voices float up from the garden and she is caught up into their life. Time is annihilated, and she lives in the closing years of the sixteenth century remembering little of her modern life, until she returns from her traveling in time bearing the anxieties and dreams of the other world. The life of two widely separated times in history - the Elizabethan and the present - goes on simultaneously, each invisible to the other.

After having narrowed his scope from the huge cosmic histories of Last and First Men (history of humanity) and Star Maker (history of the universe, Dante-esque cameo by God at the end) to the earthbound Odd John (super-man) and Sirius (super-dog), The Flames reads like an attempt to stuff them all into a 50-page novella. It's supremely confused, but the evident moroseness of an author who, in the face of a second world war, has decided that his imagination will not help, gives The Flames an immediacy that you never see in other top-flight fantasists like Borges. It is written in Stapledon's trademark stiff prose, which places it stylistically closer to H.G. Wells than to any contemporaneous science fiction originating from the United States' pulps, and if Stapledon had read any of them, it doesn't show. Even though Stapledon had rejected Wells for being too cynical, The Flames has a sludgy melancholy that allows joy only in the most ironic way. The story consists of three segments, each of which undercuts the last. In the first, the sensitive narrator talks to a \"flame\" in a burning stone who tells of life on the sun and subsequent exile when the planets were formed, with a polite dispassion not so far from that of Hal Clement. Despite some ill-fitting foreshadowing, the revelations in the second part that the flames are hellbent on manipulating humanity to help them thrive and pursue their spiritual aims, through mind control if necessary. To this end the flame reveals that he and his comrades caused the narrator's wife to commit suicide, so the narrator could devote himself fully to his studies and establish contact with the flames. This is all vaguely silly and melodramatic, and trivializes the first section. I don't know if Stapledon read Charles Fort, but he treads on similar territory here, and with no better luck than Fort or Eric Frank Russell in The Sinister Barrier. But in the third segment, Stapledon plays down the mind-control aspect and the particulars of the flames' existence to focus on their religious history, which is a rewrite of the tail end of Star Maker: advanced beings, including the flames, join into a single cosmic mind that then searches the total vision of reality. This time, though, the revelation of the total indifference of the Maker (who, while not quite absent, is not as personified as it is in Star Maker) is catastrophic and the cosmic mind collapses. Star Maker ended with a little homily on the significance of humanity's efforts; \"The Flames\" ends with the flames deciding that a Loving God is such a great idea that He must exist, and stupidly start the whole process up again, killing the narrator in the process for questioning them. All this comes as a shock after the first two parts, which had alluded to the flames' abstract spirituality but had only used it as a differentiating point between their minds and human emotional experience. Stapledon suddenly seems possessed by a need to rewrite his previous optimism from fifteen years before. The only hint of this comes late in the first segment, where, after receiving a noetic emotional experience from the flames (a great idea that Stapledon abandons), the narrator thinks he's seen God, and the flame responds, in what sounds like a rebuke from Stapledon to his younger self: Just because you have had an exciting and clarifying experience you persuade yourself that you must have had a revelation of the heart of the universe. source: www.waggish.org", "ratings": 79, "title": "The Flames: A Fantasy", "author": "Olaf Stapledon", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6445312-the-flames"}, {"year": null, "genres": ["Adventure"], "synopsis": "AN ADVENTURE CLASSIC OF \"HARD\" SCIENCE FICTION Scientific adventure, ptotofeminism, and romance are just the beginning of this enthralling SF classic. When Marjorie Driscott, of the famous Brassey seed house, is put in charge of an expedition to the ice clad Himalayas of Central Asia, she knows she is in for trouble from chauvinistic American geologist, Robert Vartan and his paleobotanist partner, Frank Shane. Their goal is a strange blue delphinium, like no other known plant on earth -- and a shovelful of soil worth $1,000,000. But others have learned of the delphinium and are determined to do whatever it takes to sabotage the Brassey expedition, and claim the prize for themselves. Soon, Marjorie Driscott discovers she and her colleagues are enmeshed in a web of scientific mystery, international intrigue, and perilous adventure amid the icy peaks and hostile tribes of Central Asia. Mystery is piled on mystery as they progress the mystery of tangled purposes and of masked personalities which is the surface pattern of the plot, but also the basic scientific mystery to which all the rest are secondary, of the source of the unearthly flowers out of nowhere, and of the strange and powerful forces behind their origin. Mishap follows misadventure -- queer discoveries crowd one upon another in a scientific romance that involves gorgeous delphinium, hereditary insanity, black ice, radioactivity, a visitant from cosmic distances and remote ages, seeds of madness, and the strangest garden ever imagined.

Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children.

When you realize that the 33 stories are ordered chronologically, you begin to grasp the scale of Cordwainer Smith's creation. Regimes, technologies, planets, moralities, religions, histories all rise and fall through his millennia.These are futuristic tales told as myth, as legend, as a history of a distant and decayed past. Written in an unadorned voice reminiscent of James Tiptree Jr., Smith's visions are dark and pessimistic, clearly a contrast from the mood of SF in his time; in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s it was still thought that science would cure the ills of humanity. In Smith's tales, space travel takes a horrendous toll on those who pilot the ships through the void. After reaching perfection, the lack of strife stifles humanity to a point of decay and stagnation; the Instrumentality of Mankind arises in order to stir things up. Many stories describe moral dilemmas involving the humanity of the Underpeople, beings evolved from animals into humanlike forms.Stories not to be missed in this collection include \"Scanners Live in Vain\", \"The Dead Lady of Clown Town\", \"Under Old Earth\", \"The Crime and the Glory of Commander Suzdal\", \"Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons\", and the truly disturbing \"A Planet Called Shayol\".

Instead of blowing Middletown to smithereens, the blast blows it right off the map--to somewhere else. First there is the new thin coldness of the air, the blazing corona and dullness of the sun, the visibility of the stars in high daylight. Then comes the inhabitants' terrifying discovery that Middletown is a twentieth--century oasis of paved streets and houses and shops and trees and gardens, in a desolate brown world without trees, without water, apparently without life, in unimaginably far--distant future Earth which lies abandoned and dying. To survive, the citizens o Middletown realize they will have to abandon their city, migrate to the alien city beyond the hills, and try to master the secrets of its long--abandoned, incredibly advanced machinery. But, the people of old Earth face their greatest crisis when they receive a communication from their own descendants, who have formed a Galactic Empire among the stars and long since evacuated Earth as uninhabitable or humans and have passed laws that it is to be preserved as a museum world and never repopulated again. If they are live in this future world, the men and women of Middletown will have to agree to leave Earth and migrate among the stars. The City at World's end is a human story of the reactions of men and women and boys and girl, people like you, suddenly thrust into an unprecedented situation. In its suspense, its intense humanity, its unexpected denouement, it is perhaps Mr. Edmond Hamilton's finest novel.

Soon the men who worked with Bossy found themselves able to solve their problems, to erase their prejudices - in short, to think.Did the world welcome Bossy with open arms and glad cries? No, because for four decades the world had been in the grip of opinion control, and Bossy represented a serious threat to that dominance. So Bossy had to go underground, and work in hiding.

His romantically-linked leads are emotionally affecting but never sentimentalized, the background of chaos in which they enact their tragic, drowning love, is sparingly but furiously painted. Heinlein\u2019s 1952 is clearly the apotheosis of those \u201cCrazy Years\u201d which he had noted in his famous chronological Future History, published a decade earlier in ASTOUNDING SCIENCE FICTION as a precis of his intended career. Perhaps no story of this period limns its political and cultural dysfunction as accurately as this novelette. Overshadowed by Heinlein\u2019s juveniles and his famous later novels, THE YEAR OF THE JACKPOT may be the purest version of his portfolio and his most memorable work of less than novel length. It is one of his most exemplary stories and perhaps his best.About the Author: Robert A. Heinlein (1907-1988) was the first great science fiction writer of the so-called \u201cModern\u201d (post-Campbellian) period and still perhaps the best. His first story, \u201cLife-Line\u201d was published in the August 1939 issue of ASTOUNDING, within three years with novels and novelettes such as SIXTH COLUMN, BLOWUPS HAPPEN, UNIVERSE, THE ROADS MUST ROLL, METHUSALEH\u2019S CHILDREN he had become the most dominant writer in the history of science fiction; this was a position he did not relinquish for the rest of his life nor has it yet been relinquished. A list of his novels is virtually a pocket history of science fiction - THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS, STARSHIP TROOPERS, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, DOUBLE STAR, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL - and all of them remain in print and controversial to this moment. He won the Hugo for Best Novel four times, was three time Guest of Honor at the World Science Fiction Convention and was the first Grand Master of the Science Fiction Writers of America. His history and that of modern science fiction cannot in any way be disentangled.About The Galaxy Project: Horace Gold led GALAXY magazine from its first issue dated October 1950 to science fiction\u2019s most admired, widely circulated and influential magazine throughout its initial decade. Its legendary importance came from publication of full length novels, novellas and novelettes. GALAXY published nearly every giant in the science fiction field.The Galaxy Project is a selection of the best of GALAXY with new forewords by some of today\u2019s best science fiction writers. The initial selections in alphabetical order include work by Ray Bradbury, Frederic Brown, Lester del Rey, Robert A. Heinlein, Damon Knight, C. M. Kornbluth, Walter M. Miller, Jr., Frederik Pohl, Robert Sheckley, Robert Silverberg, William Tenn (Phillip Klass) and Kurt Vonnegut with new Forewords by Paul di Filippo, David Drake, John Lutz, Barry Malzberg and Robert Silverberg. The Galaxy Project is committed to publishing new work in the spirit GALAXY magazine and its founding editor Horace Gold.Publication notes: This novelette appeared in the March 1952 issue of GALAXY and is the only work which Heinlein wrote specifically for Horace Gold, the editor of GALAXY magazine. (Heinlein\u2019s novel THE PUPPET MASTERS had been serialized in the September through November 1951 issues of GALAXY but Gold had merely acquired serial rights to a contract novel which had been written for Scribner\u2019s.) Heinlein never again appeared in Gold\u2019s GALAXY.

But Earthmen are incorrigible, and Martians are obstinate, and the result is an adventure-packed novel that spans two planets and several stars and is great science fiction all the way.", "ratings": 12, "title": "The Bird of Time", "author": "Wallace West", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17380956-the-bird-of-time"}, {"year": null, "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Short Stories", "Fiction"], "synopsis": "\u201cHere is a brace of vignettes by the Old Vignette Master ... short and sharp ... like a hypodermic\u201d", "ratings": 98, "title": "Two Timer", "author": "Fredric Brown", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8708988-two-timer"}, {"year": null, "genres": ["Short Stories", "Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Classics", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Young Adult"], "synopsis": "Contents: 1 \u2022 In a Season of Calm Weather \u2022 (1957) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 7 \u2022 A Medicine for Melancholy \u2022 (1959) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 16 \u2022 The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit \u2022 non-genre \u2022 (1958) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 39 \u2022 Fever Dream \u2022 (1948) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 46 \u2022 The Marriage Mender \u2022 (1954) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 51 \u2022 The Town Where No One Got Off \u2022 (1958) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 59 \u2022 A Scent of Sarsaparilla \u2022 (1953) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 66 \u2022 The Headpiece \u2022 (1958) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 74 \u2022 The First Night of Lent \u2022 [The Irish Stories] \u2022 (1956) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 81 \u2022 The Time of Going Away \u2022 (1956) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 88 \u2022 All Summer in a Day \u2022 (1954) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 94 \u2022 The Gift \u2022 (1952) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 97 \u2022 The Great Collision of Monday Last \u2022 [The Irish Stories] \u2022 (1958) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 104 \u2022 The Little Mice \u2022 (1955) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 109 \u2022 The Shore Line at Sunset \u2022 (1959) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury (variant of The Shoreline at Sunset) 118 \u2022 The Day It Rained Forever \u2022 (1957) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 129 \u2022 Chrysalis \u2022 (1946) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 150 \u2022 Pillar of Fire \u2022 (1948) \u2022 novelette by Ray Bradbury 188 \u2022 Zero Hour \u2022 (1947) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 198 \u2022 The Man \u2022 (1949) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 210 \u2022 Time in Thy Flight \u2022 (1953) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 215 \u2022 The Pedestrian \u2022 (1951) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 220 \u2022 Hail and Farewell \u2022 (1953) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 228 \u2022 Invisible Boy \u2022 (1945) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury 237 \u2022 Come Into My Cellar \u2022 (1962) \u2022 short story by Ray Bradbury (variant of Boys!

The Colonial Survey agency has decreed the (fictional) planet of Loren Two to be off-limits, due to the extremely dangerous native animals. Despite its decree, the Colonial Survey has authorized an experimental colony on the planet. At about the same time, the overcrowded inhabitants of another planet have established an unauthorized reconnaissance station on Loren Two. Neither group is aware of the other's existence. The authorized colony is well-funded, consisting of one dozen persons equipped with advanced robotic and other equipment. The unauthorized reconnaissance team consists of a single man, Huyghens (no first name given), accompanied by an eagle and four specially-bred Kodiak bears. The bears have been bred (the story uses the term \"mutated\") so as to have the psychological profile of dogs. They are friendly to humans and able to work in teams. When the story begins, Huyghens receives a signal indicating that a ship is about to land near his station. The ship drops off its sole passenger, an officer with the Colonial Survey named Roane (no first name given), and then departs. Roane soon learns that Huyghens is an illegal trespasser on the planet and that his (Huyghens') signal beacon was not that of the authorized colony. For his part, Huyghens is surprised to learn that there was an authorized colony on the same planet. The two men put their minds to the question of why the authorized colony's signal beacon was not working and soon determine that it has been replaced with a low-technology emergency beacon. From this, the two men surmise that the authorized colony has been overrun by the indigenous predators, but that some colonists might still be alive in the mine tunnels that the colony was expected to have dug. Huyghens and Roane, along with the bears and the eagle, undertake a dangerous cross-country trek to determine the status of the authorized colony.", "ratings": 44, "title": "Exploration Team", "author": "Murray Leinster", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23608878-exploration-team"}, {"year": null, "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Speculative Fiction", "Science Fiction Fantasy"], "synopsis": "Science fiction from the great mystery writer and creator of the Travis McGee", "ratings": 390, "title": "Wine of the Dreamers", "author": "John D.

Colorful, spectacular, wildly imaginative, it lived up to everything its agent could possibly want, a man who was known as Mr. Science Fiction and who now brings back this classic Forrest J Ackerman. A phrase he coined in another galaxy a long time ago say's it Gosh Wow! This story has it all. The cover of this special edition features Jeff Morrow in the role of one of the most sympathetic aliens in 1950's science fiction film (the other is Michael Rennie in The Day the Earth Stood Still, also adapted from a literary source). In the novel he is Jorgasnovara, in the movie the less jaw Breaking Exeter. In both print and celluloid he comes to respect the Earth scientists essayed by Rex Reason and Faith Domergue. This Island Earth is a book of heroes. The first half of the film closely follows the novel but then diverges from the intellectual challenges faced by Dr. Cal Meachem to more cinematic fare. Reading the novel now, one cannot help but marvel at how Jones' views everything from labor disputes to the predictability of computers influenced later movies and television, making This Island Earth, the novel, even more influential than-one would guess from ThisIsland Earth the movie. Pulpless.Com is proud to bring back the printed word in hope that all who see the movie will want to read the book, and vice versa!

Billy Justin, a 38-year-old commercial artist & Korea War veteran works as a dairy farmer in Chiunga Ctr, NY when he hears over the radio that Soviet & Chinese forces have overrun American lines. Over the next months, they consolidate their hold, dividing the US at the Mississippi, forming between them the Democratic People's Republic of N America. Other than a garrison, disarmament & establishment of food production quotas, the surrender leaves Chiunga Center largely untouched. A paraplegic comes to Justin's farm asking for work. He's given make-work, then leaves. When Justin enters the nearest town, Norton, for supplies, he's drawn into a conspiracy with the paraplegic & others. The former turns out to be an army general. Buried in Chiunga County is a half-finished weapons satellite that requires parts & technical know-how to orbit it. The Soviet military police soon apparently capture all of them but himself & the general. Receiving messages hidden in mail Betsy Cardew delivers, Justin deduces that the contacts he needs are in Washington, PA. With a traveling preacher, Sparhawk, he walks from Chiunga to Washington. Arrested by a military patrol, they're separated. Justin attempts to pass himself as one of Sparhawk's converts who can't be molested due to the Democratic Republic's freedom of religion. He & Sparhawk are exiled at the town border & soon arrive at Washington. He's given instructions about an assault planned for Xmas Eve on Chiunga Ctr to liberate the satellite. He & Sparhawk are sent back there with a specialist. Despite Soviet torture of a local farmer, they're kept ignorant of what \"Xmas Eve\", a mild oath they hear sworn by citizens, means til battle begins. Coordinated by Gen Hollerith, the paraplegic, area bridges are blown up & arsenals sabotaged as townspeople are armed & fight as the satellite is launched. Hollerith's forces triumph. A radio message declares the satellite will destroy Moscow & Peiking in 24 hours if occupation soldiers don't evacuate American soil & release war prisoners.

To Dale Sutton, the biggest man on campus at the Space Academy, it was a slap in the face to be ordered to such a crate. But his biggest shock came when orders set the ALBATROSS and its two companion ships on a course that let straight to the dreaded planet Saturn. No one had ever come back from Saturn, yet everyone knew the story of Captain Dearborn who had led the first and only expedition to the ringed planet a century earlier. His diary was the record of a steadily losing battle against the unknown as one by one, the little party had vanished.Now, a hundred years later, the superstitious crew of the ALBATROSS found it impossible to rid themselves of the feeling that the same catastrophe that had wiped out the previous expedition would strike again. They had hardly been settled a day in Dearborn's old underground quarters on Titan, Saturn's largest satellite, when their gnawing fears began to materialize.

But greater and more deadly horrors were yet to panicky moments of groping though ghastly underground caves, the appearance of a face bearing the same twisted features of the illustrious Captain Dearborn, a collision that sends Titan up in a blaze of destruction, and the final landing on Saturn, a planet heaving with volcanos and covered with streams of molten lava.Philip Latham's portrayal of life on a planet about whose conditions few have ventured a guess is a tale guaranteed to make the reader as numb with terror as the men the author writes about.Philip Latham was a pen name used by Dr. Robert S.

Yet the most important thing on Steve's mind was not his work, but the iron collar locked securely around his neck. Filled with a lethal charge of explosives, it could be detonated any time the Plan of Man considered him too much of a risk. That's why he had to obey every order, and succeed at his experiments. Only then, perhaps, could he use the jetless drive himself\u2026 and escape to the safety of the half-mythical Reefs of Space, strange formations rumored to exist somewhere beyond the orbit of Pluto. But if he failed, the next step would be the Living Body Bank\u2014a scientific horror chamber from which no one ever returned.

I make no apologies for these. The only explanation I can make is that in the years which elapsed between the events in this book, and the later novel dealing with the final destruction of the Sharra matrix, Lew's memories of these events may have altered his perceptions.

Campbell, Jr., Award for best young science fiction writer. One summer day in the 1920s, Haverstock's Traveling Curiosus and Wondershow rides into a small Midwestern town. Haverstock's show is a presentation of mysterious wonders: feats of magic, strange creatures, and frightening powers. Three teenage girls attend the opening performance that evening which, for each, promises love and threatens death. The three girls are drawn to the show and its performers-a lusty centaur, Angel the magical albino boy, the rowdy stage hands-but frightened by the enigmatic owner, Haverstock. The girls at first try to dismiss these marvels as trickery, but it becomes all too real, too vivid to be other than nightmare reality. Each feels the force of the show and its power to alter everyday lives: Francine is drawn embarrassingly to the centaur, Rose makes an assignation with one of the hands and gets in trouble, and Evelyn is fascinated by the pathetic, mysterious Angel, The Boy Who Can Fly, and together they plan escape. No stranger or more disturbing vision of the dark side of carnival life has been handled with such grace or conviction since Bradbury's vintage period.

There, perhaps, lies the greatest irony of all, that I named myself anew after Estri Hadrath diet Estrazi, who in reality I had once been. And perhaps it is not irony at all, but an expression of Khys' humor, an implicit dissertation by him who structured my experiences, my very thoughts, for nearly two years, until his audacity drove him to bring together once more Sereth crill Tyris, past-Slayer, then the outlawed Ebvrasea, then arrar to the dharen himself; Chayin rendi Inekte, cahndor of Nemar, co-cahndor of the Taken Lands, chosen so of Tar-Kesa, and at that time Khys' puppet-vassal; and myself, former Well-Keepress, tiask of Nemar, and lastly becoming the chaldless outlaw who had come to judgment and endured ongoing retribution at the dharen's hands. To test his hesting, his power over owkahen, the time-coming-to-be, did Khys put us together, all three, in his Day-Keeper's city -- and from that moment onward, the Weathers of Life became fixed: siphoned into a singular future; sealed tight as a dead god in his mausoleum, whose every move brought him closer to the sum total, obliteration.

Earth's inhabitants are unfazed as they believe him to be yet another doomsayer; the End of the Earth has been predicted for centuries. Jherek is far more interested in Mrs Amelia Underwood, a time traveller from Victorian England, as he is fascinated by the Victorian era. Jherek resolves to fall in love with her. Mrs Underwood, at first repulsed by the debauchery of the End of Time, finally comes to believe that Jherek is sincere in his affections and starts teaching him about moral values. She falls in love with him at last; as they are about to embrace, however, she is whisked back to her own time. Jherek, heartbroken, decides to rescue her, and travels to 19th century London.Jherek is inexperienced to the point of naivete about the Victorian Era, despite his interest in it, and a (temporally) local thief, Snoozer Vine, tricks him into becoming an accomplice to Snoozer's latest scam. Not surprisingly, Jherek proves to be a poor criminal, and is quickly arrested, jailed and sent to trial. To his surprise, the judge appears to be none other than his friend, Lord Jagged but claims to be one Jagger. Jherek is sentenced to death, as the case against him is unequivocal, but he cannot understand why all the people around him are so upset; inhabitants of the End of Time are immortal, and for them death is merely transitory.

Earthmen do not dominate among inhabited worlds, as many races are older and wiser -- in fact, space travelers from Earth are second-class citizens or worse on most of the planets they visit.  Joseph Farber, an artist, is part of the uncomfortable and decadent Earth colony among the alien Cian on the planet Weinunnach. As with many earthling spacefarers, Farber suffers a decline in spirits when faced with the utter difference of alien cultures, yet he is deeply moved by the rituals of the Cian -- and by Liraun, a humanoid Cian, with whom he falls in love. And though love between races is forbidden, he allows himself to be genetically altered so that he and Liraun may marry and interbreed.

Things go crazy immediately. His spaceship runs into gravitational vortices at relativistic speeds, resulting in massive time anomalies. It may be a blessing in disguise. The reason he couldn\u2019t get out of the way was that a meteor had shattered the drive regulator & rudder. He could no longer steer his ship. He had a spare rudder, but couldn\u2019t install it. It was a two-man job & he was alone. So when other versions of him start appearing, all he should need do is team up with one of them, fix the rudder & leave the gravitational vortex field.After that gets straightened out, he goes undercover. A ship\u2019s computer has mutineed & started its own colony, reproducing itself on a previously uninhabited planet. The insurance company paid the shipowner\u2019s claim, & now believes that the ship, it\u2019s computer & all its progeny belong to them. Tichy disguises himself as a robot & goes to investigate.On another voyage, he heads to a planet where the government irrigation agency has irrigated beyond all need & refused to give up power.

In The Fabulous Riverboat, Farmer tells the tale of one person whose is uniquely suited to find the river's headwaters, riverboat captain and famous Earthly author Sam Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain). Clemens has been visited by \"X,\" a mysterious being who claims to be a rebel among the group that created Riverworld. X tells Clemens where he can find a large deposit of iron and other materials that Clemens can use to build the greatest riverboat ever seen. Since there is virtually no metal on the planet, it will also give Clemens an unbeatable edge when it comes to battling the various warlike societies that dominate the Riverworld. But Clemens is not alone in his quest for the iron, which arrives on the planet in the form of a giant meteorite. In fact, Clemens is besieged on all sides by forces determined to seize the precious ore, leading him to make a deadly pact with one of history's most notorious villains, John Lackland. Lackland's crimes during his reign as king of England were so hideous that no other English monarch will ever carry his name, and he's up to equally nefarious tricks on Riverworld. However, Clemens has a guardian angel in the form of Joe Miller, a giant subhuman with a big nose, a serious lisp, and a cutting wit. Miller has also been to the very headwaters of the river, where he saw a mysterious tower in the middle of the North Sea and where the creators of Riverworld are thought to reside. He will be an invaluable ally in completing the riverboat and sailing to the headwaters, but even an 800-pound giant may not be enough to help Clemens fulfill X's mission. --Craig E.

Selected by a vote of the membership of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), these 26 reprints represent the best, most important, and most influential stories and authors in the field. The contributors are a Who's Who of classic SF, with every Golden Age giant included: Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, John W. Campbell, Robert A. Heinlein, Fritz Leiber, Cordwainer Smith, Theodore Sturgeon, and Roger Zelazny. Other contributors are less well known outside the core SF readership. Three of the contributors are famous for one story--but what stories!--Tom Godwin's pivotal hard-SF tale, \"The Cold Equations\"; Jerome Bixby's \"It's a Good Life\" (made only more infamous by the chilling Twilight Zone adaptation); and Daniel Keyes's \"Flowers for Algernon\" (brought to mainstream fame by the movie adaptation, Charly). The collection has some minor but frustrating flaws. There are no contributor biographies, which is bad enough when the author is a giant; but it's especially sad for contributors who have become unjustly obscure. Each story's original publication date is in small print at the bottom of the first page. And neither this fine print nor the copyright page identifies the magazines in which the stories first appeared. Prefaced by editor Robert Silverberg's introduction, which describes SFWA and details the selection process, The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964 is a wonderful book for the budding SF fan. Experienced SF readers should compare the table of contents to their library before making a purchase decision. Fans who contemplate giving this book to non-SF readers should bear in mind that, while several of the collected stories can measure up to classic mainstream literary stories, the less literarily-acceptable stories are weighted toward the front of the collection; adult mainstream-literature fans may not get very far into The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964. --Cynthia Ward\u00b7 Introduction \u00b7 Robert Silverberg \u00b7 in \u00b7 A Martian Odyssey [Tweel] \u00b7 Stanley G.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.", "ratings": 1398173, "title": "Ender\u2019s Game (Ender's Saga, #1)", "author": "Orson Scott Card", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game"}, {"year": null, "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Space Opera", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Audiobook", "Horror"], "synopsis": "On the world called Hyperion, beyond the law of the Hegemony of Man, there waits the creature called the Shrike.

Indeed, it is unlike anything anyone has ever written! And it is a volume that begs for illustration.

John is waiting just upriver in the Rex Grandissimus, the first riverboat that Sam constructed and the one that John and his crew hijacked, and he's hell-bent on sinking Sam's boat (and vice versa). Complicating the battle is the fact that both ships likely contain agents of the Ethicals, the group of advanced beings who created Riverworld for reasons unknown. One or more of the Ethicals themselves may even be on board, as are various humans that the rebel Ethical, known as the Mysterious Stranger (but known to Clemens simply as X), enlisted in his cause, which may or may not lead to humanity's salvation. The battle is set to take place along the shores populated by members of the Church of the Second Chance, a group that believes they must attain ethical perfection in order to proceed to the next phase of existence. The Second Chancers are not violent, but their charismatic leader, La Viro, may attempt to sink one or both of the iron ships in order to prevent the battle. Among the Second Chancers is former Nazi officer Hermann Goring, who had a run-in with Sir Richard Francis Burton in the first Riverworld novel, To Your Scattered Bodies Go. Burton and his companions--among them several people who were contacted by the Mysterious Stranger--are reluctantly serving on John's boat in order to reach the headwaters of the river.

R.

Lisa Tuttle has won acclaim from fans of science fiction, horror, and fantasy alike\u2014 most recently for her haunting novel The Pillow Friend. Now together they gift readers with this classic tale of a brilliantly rendered world of ironbound tradition, where a rebellious soul seeks to prove the power of a dream.The planet of Windhaven was not originally a home to humans, but it became one following the crash of a colony starship. It is a world of small islands, harsh weather, and monster-infested seas. Communication among the scattered settlements was virtually impossible until the discovery that, thanks to light gravity and a dense atmosphere, humans were able to fly with the aid of metal wings made of bits of the cannibalized spaceship.Many generations later, among the scattered islands that make up the water world of Windhaven, no one holds more prestige than the silver-winged flyers, who bring news, gossip, songs, and stories. They are romantic figures crossing treacherous oceans, braving shifting winds and sudden storms that could easily dash them from the sky to instant death. They are also members of an increasingly elite caste, for the wings\u2014always in limited quantity\u2014are growing gradually rarer as their bearers perish.With such elitism comes arrogance and a rigid adherence to hidebound tradition. And for the flyers, allowing just anyone to join their cadre is an idea that borders on heresy. Wings are meant only for the offspring of flyers\u2014now the new nobility of Windhaven. Except that sometimes life is not quite so neat.Maris of Amberly, a fisherman's daughter, was raised by a flyer and wants nothing more than to soar on the currents high above Windhaven. By tradition, however, the wings must go to her stepbrother, Coll, the flyer's legitimate son. But Coll wants only to be a singer, traveling the world by sea. So Maris challenges tradition, demanding that flyers be chosen on the basis of merit rather than inheritance. And when she wins that bitter battle, she discovers that her troubles are only beginning.For not all flyers are willing to accept the world's new structure, and as Maris battles to teach those who yearn to fly, she finds herself likewise fighting to preserve the integrity of a society she so longed to join\u2014not to mention the very fabric that holds her culture together.", "ratings": 6846, "title": "Windhaven", "author": "George R.R.

Ansset's voice is both a blessing and a curse, for the young Songbird can reflect all the hopes and fears his audience feels and, by magnifying their emotions, use his voice to heal--or to destroy.

It is a saga of love, power and treachery that will appeal to men and women equally; full of action, compulsively readable and quite unlike anything being published in the realms of fantasy today.The heroine, Shebat, is a remarkable girl from Earth. She is brought to the vast empire of the Kerrion family by a renegade son; named as its future ruler on a whim of his autocratic father; abducted to the slums where the Kerrions' slaves drug themselves with powerful mystical sorcery; and finally rescued to take part in a great rebellion. She falls in love with one brother but marries another and becomes more Kerrion than some born to the name. A magical seductress of men, passionate in her lust for power, Shebat moves among those who control the destinies of millions, for whom treachery and betrayal are as easy as murder. Set in the timeless future on a primitive, savage Earth and on the sophisticated habitats of deep space, Dream Dancer is the first volume of a three-part saga. \"Not since Dune have we witnessed a power struggle of such awesome intensity.

When thoughts of him invade her sleep, the dreams seem so real that she wakes with the feel of his lips lingering on her skin. Soon after, however, the one guy she thought she\u2019d never date suddenly asks her out.

By \"parallel,\" Card means that Shadow begins and ends at roughly the same time as Game, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil.  Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of Shadow, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know. Although it may seem like Shadow is merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous Ender's Game, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of Ender's Game hinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, Shadow manages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that Shadow, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. --Craig E.

It's a moment of synchronicity - if not serendipity - which leads them into a chaotic system of their own, complete with a million-dollar research grant, caff\u00e9 latte, tattoos, and a series of unlucky coincidences that leaves Bennett monkeyless, fundless, and nearly jobless. Sandra intercedes with a flock of sheep and an idea for a joint project.

The country's at war, and professional baseball needs able-bodied men. Danny's headed for Highbridge, Georgia - home of the Goober Pride peanut butter factory and the Highbridge Hellbenders, a Class C farm club in the Chattahoochee Valley League. He's a scrappy player with one minor quirk: a violent encounter on the train to Georgia has rendered him mute, his vocal cords tied up in knots. Danny's idiosyncrasy, however, is nothing compared to that of his new Hellbender roommate, an erudite seven-foot giant by the name of Jumbo Hank Clerval. With his yellow eyes, strangely scarred face, and sausage-sized fingers, Hank seems to have been put together in a meat-packing plant. But he plays a mean first base and can hit the ball a mile. With the Hellbenders in a pennant race as hot as the relentless Georgia sun, the eloquent Clerval forms a special kinship with the speechless kid from Oklahoma. Danny soon realizes that Hank is not an ordinary man but something more complex...more mysterious than he'd imagined. These two very different ballplayers forge a bond as the season moves inexorably toward its dramatic, and ultimately violent, conclusion. Both want a shot at the major leagues and both want to know what it's like to be a man.

In worlds that have fallen - or should have. They wage battles in wars already lost and become heroes - and sometimes martyrs - in their last-ditch efforts to preserve the dignity and individuality of humanity. A hack Indian filmmaker takes the pulse of a wounded and declining civilization - 21st-century Britain. A pair of swashbuckling Silicon Valley entrepreneurs join forces to make a commercial killing - in organic underground slime and computer-generated jellyfish. A man in a Japanese city takes orders from a talking cat while pursuing a drama of danger and adventure that has become the very essence of his life.From The Littlest Jackal, a darkly hilarious thriller of mercs and gunrunners set in Finland, to a stark vision of a post-atomic netherworld in his haunting tale Taklamakan, Bruce Sterling once again breaks boundaries, breaks icons, and breaks rules to unleash the most dangerously provocative and intelligent science fiction being written today.Contents:- Maneki Neko (1998)- Big Jelly (1994, with Rudy Rucker)- The Littlest Jackal (1996)- Sacred Cow (1993)- Deep Eddy (1993)- Bicycle Repairman (1996)- Taklamakan (1998)Cover illustration by Eric Dinyer", "ratings": 666, "title": "A Good Old-Fashioned Future", "author": "Bruce Sterling", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359376.A_Good_Old_Fashioned_Future"}, {"year": null, "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Audiobook", "Novels", "Aliens"], "synopsis": "Algis Budrys' first novel to appear in fifteen years, Hard Landing begins with report of an electocuted man found lying on the tracks of the Burrow Street station in Shoreview, Illinois.

The Earth lies at the center of the universe, surrounded by crystal spheres which hold each of the planets, the sun and the moon, all enclosed in the sphere of the fixed stars. Earthly matter, composed of the classical four elements of earth, air, fire, and water, naturally moves in straight lines. Heavenly matter naturally rises and moves in circles. This is the universe as understood by the ancient Greeks.The science of the ancient Chinese also applies, but as the novel is told from the perspective of the Greeks, it is less well understood. Xi, the Chinese notion of spirit and flow, can be manipulated to move objects and energy. The Chinese five elements of earth, metal, water, wood, and fire are transmuted one into the other. Part of the central theme of the book is the two system's mutual misunderstanding and bafflement of each other.In this world, the Delian League (Greeks) and Middle Kingdom (Chinese) have been fighting a war for nearly a thousand years, ever since the time of Alexander the Great when the warrior-culture of Sparta and the Athenian Akademe were fused into a half-world conquering force. Their technologies are locked together, however, and neither empire can gain the upper hand. Each side secretly despairs of its chances and has come to consider desperate measures.The story is narrated by Aias of Tyre, a scientist of the Delian League, who is preparing to embark on Project Sunthief as scientific commander. This project is an audacious and desperate mission to sail a spaceship carved out of a piece of the moon herself out through the spheres, to catch a piece of the sun and bring it back to earth to annihilate the Middler capital city.

Aber meine Erinnerungen an diese Zeit, jetzt biomechanisch verst\u00e4rkt, sind immer noch sehr lebhaft.\" So beginnt die Erz\u00e4hlung von Tina, die eigentlich 'Akushtina hei\u00dft, aber den Maya-Namen der illegalen Einwanderin aus S\u00fcdmexiko kann in Los Angeles niemand richtig aussprechen. Eines Nachts, auf dem Nachhauseweg von ihrer Arbeit als Kellnerin, begegnet sie einem r\u00e4tselhaften Mann mit purpurnem Haar und sonderbaren Augen, der sie vor einem brutalen \u00dcberfall besch\u00fctzt. Es ist Althor vom Sternenreich Skolia, der aus der fernen Zukunft der Menschheit kommt und in unserer Zeit gestrandet ist, allerdings ist die Geschichte hier etwas anderes verlaufen, als uns bekannt. Der in telepathischer Verbindung zu seinem Raumschiff stehende, und mit vielen kybernetischen Implantaten aufger\u00fcstete Elitesoldat ist den Menschen von 1987 zwar weit \u00fcberlegen, doch nach einem Sabotageanschlag auf sein Schiff ist er auf 'Akushtinas Hilfe angewiesen. Und \u00fcberrascht stellt er fest, dass diese ohne Anleitung schon Zeit ihres Lebens telepathische Kr\u00e4fte entwickelt hat -- eine F\u00e4higkeit, die 'Akushtina immer verzweifelt zu verbergen versuchte.Catherine Asaro hat f\u00fcr ihren zweiten Roman um Das Sternenreich von Skolia den Sapphire-Award f\u00fcr die sch\u00f6nste Liebesgeschichte innerhalb der SF erhalten. Zu Recht, und das obwohl die Physikerin ihr Zukunftsm\u00e4rchen mit vielen wissenschaftlich fundierten Ideen unterf\u00fcttert hat. So werden zum Beispiel die telepathischen F\u00e4higkeiten der beiden Hauptfiguren glaubw\u00fcrdig erkl\u00e4rt, und ebenso \u00fcberzeugend ist die Darstellung von Althors kybernetischer Aufr\u00fcstung.

Herrlich komisch ist zum Beispiel, wie 'Akushtina ihrem \u00fcbermenschlichen Geliebten den Gebrauch eines Kondoms erkl\u00e4rt.Der neue Roman der Skolia-Reihe schlie\u00dft nicht an die Ereignisse von Der Psi-Faktor an, die werden erst in Der letzte Falke fortgesetzt.

Highlights include a black mind reader who pays a visit to a white serial killer, a husband who falls prey to a vampiric personal computer, and a love affair between a young man and a woman who may be more undead than alive. Perhaps even more fascinating are the painfully candid snapshots of autobiography running throughout the volume.

This \"trilogy,\" which is really a set of interrelated, essentially independent theological comedies, began in 1994 with the World Fantasy Award-winning Towing Jehovah and continued, three years later, with Blameless in Abaddon. As Morrow tells us in his acknowledgments, the novels can be read singly, sequentially, or in any order at all. However you choose to do it, I strongly recommend that you read all three. They are simply too good to ignore. In Towing Jehovah, the two-mile-long corpse of God the Father is found floating in the North Atlantic. Anthony Van Horne, disgraced captain of the supertanker Carpco Valparaiso, is commissioned by the Vatican to tow the body (known thereafter as the Corpus Dei) to its final resting place in the Arctic Sea. In Blameless in Abaddon, the Corpus Dei drifts away from that final resting place and comes to the attention of a consternated world. Shortly afterward, medical testimony indicates that God is not entirely dead. Though deeply comatose, He retains a degree of neural activity and eventually finds Himself bound over for trial in the International Court of Justice in The Hague. There, Martin Candle -- a sort of latter-day embodiment of Job -- prosecutes Him, on behalf of the world's victims, for crimes against humanity. The Eternal Footman opens ten years after the initial discovery of the Corpus Dei, which, by this time, has begun to come apart. God's flesh has completely dissolved, while His skull -- after vomiting out its own brain -- has detached itself from the body and ascended into the heavens, where it floats above the Western Hemisphere in geosynchronous orbit, a tangible symbol of mortality. Beneath that symbol -- the governing image of this book -- Morrow has constructed a very funny, very moving comedy about love, death, and existential dread in the post-theistic age. Morrow drives a large cast of characters -- some new, some familiar from earlier volumes -- through a picaresque plot dominated by a single, central conceit: the plague of fetches. Early in the narrative, Nora Burkhart -- a widowed ex-schoolteacher with a previously unsuspected capacity for heroism -- learns that her only son, Kevin, has literally been invaded by a lethal doppelganger named Quincy. Quincy is a fetch: the tangible manifestation of Kevin's death and the embodiment of what T. S. Eliot called the Eternal Footman. Under Quincy's parasitic influence, Kevin becomes gravely, perhaps terminally, ill. Immediately afterward, fetches begin to proliferate across the hemisphere, bringing death and despair to an already bewildered populace. Nora's stubborn determination to save her son leads her on an odyssey across the blighted landscape of a world suffering from \"theothanatopsis syndrome,\" a fatal preoccupation with the death of God. Nora's journey is the central thread in a complex narrative that moves from Massachusetts to Mexico and from the world of a traveling theater troupe to the drug-induced dream worlds of cities known as Deus Absconditus and Holistica. In the course of her travels, Nora's story intertwines with those of the novel's other principal participants. Included among them are Anthony Van Horne, who once towed Jehovah to His arctic tomb; Adrian Lucido, psychoanalyst, charlatan, and corrupt founder of the Church of Earthly Affirmation; and Gerard Korty, world-renowned sculptor. Much of The Eternal Footman concerns the creation of Korty's masterpiece, the \"Stone Gospel,\" which is directly inspired by a book called Parables of the Post-Theistic Age by Towing Jehovah's Thomas Ockham. In the \"Stone Gospel,\" Korty gives concrete form to the novel's animating humanist vision: the vision of a world no longer dominated by the vast, transcendental abstractions of the Age of Christianity. In Ockham's words, \"If the coming era must have a religion, then let it be a religion of everyday miracles and quotidian epiphanies, of short eternities and little myths. In the post-theistic age, let Christianity become merely kindness, salvation transmute into art, truth defer to knowledge, and faith embrace a vibrant doubt.\" No brief summary can do more than suggest the scope and quality of Morrow's achievement, both in The Eternal Footman and in the equally ambitious novels that preceded it. No summary can adequately convey the constant play of wit, learning, and intellectual rigor that Morrow brings to this entire astonishing enterprise. The Godhead Cycle is unlike anything that has appeared in American fiction in recent years, and it deserves serious, widespread attention. All three volumes are consummate examples of the satirist's art, and they are going to be read and remembered for a very long time. \u0097Bill Sheehan", "ratings": 573, "title": "The Eternal Footman (Godhead, #3)", "author": "James K.

Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger, and he\u2019s starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts. Living with his son\u2019s family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice.

When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination.

In early twenty-first-century Thailand, Scott is an expatriate slacker. Then, one day, he inadvertently witnesses an impossible event: the violent appearance of a 200-foot stone pillar in the forested interior. Its arrival collapses trees for a quarter mile around its base, freezing ice out of the air and emitting a burst of ionizing radiation. It appears to be composed of an exotic form of matter. And the inscription chiseled into it commemorates a military victory--twenty years in the future.Shortly afterwards, another, larger pillar arrives in the center of Bangkok-obliterating the city and killing thousands. Over the next several years, human society is transformed by these mysterious arrivals from, seemingly, our own near future. Who is the warlord \"Kuin\" whose victories they note? Scott wants only to rebuild his life.

For Nathan Lee Swift, a young American field researcher and expectant father, the line between noble discovery and the plunder of ruins is sacred -- until the night he crosses it. At a Roman landfill beneath the crucifixion grounds known as Golgotha, Nathan Lee yields to his professor's greed and turns common grave robber. His world -- his unborn daughter -- seems lost to him.Hundreds of miles away, on the remote Greek island of Corfu, a wealthy collector pries open his latest black-market purchase -- a fourteen-inch holy relic containing a vial of blood dating back to the first century -- and unleashes a two-thousand-year-old plague. As the pandemic explodes from the Mediterranean basin and threatens to devour humankind, Nathan Lee gets a chance at redemption.

The Separation suggests an alternate history lying along a road not taken in World War II. But there are complications. In 1999, history author Stuart Gratton is intrigued by a minor mystery of the European war which ended on 10 May 1941. The British-German armistice signed that month has had far-reaching consequences, including a resettlement of European Jews in Madagascar.  In 1936, the identical twin brothers Joe and Jack Sawyer win a rowing medal for Britain in the Berlin Olympics: it's presented to them by Rudolf Hess. The brothers are separated not only by a twin's fierce need \"to be treated as a separate human being\", but by sexual rivalry and even ideology. When war breaks out Jack becomes a gung-ho bomber pilot, Joe a conscientious objector. Still they're inescapably linked, and sometimes confused. Both suffer injuries and hauntingly similar ambulance journeys. Churchill writes a puzzled memo (later unearthed by Gratton) about the anomaly of a registered-pacifist Red Cross worker flying planes for Bomber Command. Hess has significant, eventually incompatible meetings with both men. Contradictions are everywhere.  As in his magical 1995 novel The Prestige Priest is fruitfully fascinated by the legerdemain of twins, doubles, impostors, symmetrical roles. Churchill's double briefly appears. So does the famous conspiracy theory that the Hess who flew to Britain with his quixotic peace deal wasn't the real Hess ring true? Clearly The Separation was impressively, extensively researched. Its evocations of bombing raids--from either side of the bomb sites--are memorable.  The unfolding story strands become increasingly disorienting and hallucinatory; the easy escape route of dismissing one strand as delusion is itself subtly undermined. The Separation is filled with a sense of the precariousness of history; of small events and choices with extraordinary consequences. --David Langford", "ratings": 1281, "title": "The Separation", "author": "Christopher Priest", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106921.The_Separation"}, {"year": null, "genres": ["Short Stories", "Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Speculative Fiction", "Anthologies", "Science Fiction Fantasy"], "synopsis": "The recipient of numerous literary prizes, including the National Book Award, the Kafka Award, five Hugo Awards and five Nebula Awards, the renowned writer Ursula K.

But the last remains of civilisation have already become a distant memory, the stuff of myth and legend. More than 20 years have passed since the last plane took off from the earth. Rusted railways lead into emptiness. The ether is void and the airwaves echo to a soulless howling where previously the frequencies were full of news from Tokyo, New York, Buenos Aires. Man has handed over stewardship of the earth to new life-forms. Mutated by radiation, they are better adapted to the new world. Man's time is over.

It is humanity's last refuge. Stations have become mini-statelets, their people uniting around ideas, religions, water-filters - or the simple need to repulse an enemy incursion. It is a world without a tomorrow, with no room for dreams, plans, hopes. Feelings have given way to instinct - the most important of which is survival. Survival at any price. VDNKh is the northernmost inhabited station on its line. It was one of the Metro's best stations and still remains secure. But now a new and terrible threat has appeared.

Still less does he suspect that he must soon take responsibility for the lives of people he has come to care about and the preservation of their hopes for the future of humankind.Winner of a bronze medal in the Independent Publisher (IPPY) Book Awards, this controversial novel deals with government-imposed health care, end-of-life issues, and the so-called paranormal powers of the human mind. Despite being set in the distant future on another world, it appeals not only to science fiction readers but to others who question the dominant medical philosophy of today's society, or who value personal freedom of choice.This is the first book of the Founders of Maclairn duology, followed by  Promise of the Flame.

Once, all power in the Vin Lands was held by the prince-mages, who alone could craft spellwines, and selfishly used them to increase their own wealth and influence. But their abuse of power caused a demigod to break the Vine, shattering the power of the mages. Now, fourteen centuries later, it is the humble Vinearts who hold the secret of crafting spells from wines, the source of magic, and they are prohibited from holding power.But now rumors come of a new darkness rising in the vineyards. Strange, terrifying creatures, sudden plagues, and mysterious disappearances threaten the land. Only one Vineart senses the danger, and he has only one weapon to use against it: a young slave. His name is Jerzy, and his origins are unknown, even to him. Yet his uncanny sense of the Vinearts' craft offers a hint of greater magics within \u0097 magics that his Master, the Vineart Malech, must cultivate and grow. But time is running out. If Malech cannot teach his new apprentice the secrets of the spellwines, and if Jerzy cannot master his own untapped powers, the Vin Lands shall surely be destroyed.

And Martin is a man who desperately needs something to believe in, especially with his marriage coming apart and the murder of his brother, an L.A. cop brutally gunned down in the line of duty, unsolved.As the public face of the buyout program, Martin is a lightning rod for verbal and physical abuse-but he embraces every challenge, knowing his motives are pure. But when evidence comes to light that a felon in line for a buyout may have been involved with his brother's death, Martin's professional detachment threatens to turn into a personal vendetta that will jeopardize everything-and everyone-he holds dear. Inspired by today's politics, Buyout is an unforgettable look at an all-too-believable future . . . and one man's struggle to do the right thing.", "ratings": 80, "title": "Buyout: A Novel", "author": "Alexander C.

With L. Timmel Duchamp\u2019s million-word Marq\u2019ssan novel (broken into five books), anarchy is extrapolated. This is not anarchy in its popular sense, but in its truest sense.

This is the kind of novel which probably won\u2019t appeal to a mass audience, in part because it steps outside the usual genre rules.

Cherryh has been enthralling audiences for nearly thirty years with rich and complex novels. Now at the peak of her career, this three-time Hugo Award winner launches her most ambitious work in decades, Hammerfall, part of a far-ranging series, The Gene Wars, set in an entirely new universe scarred by the most vicious of future weaponry, nanotechnology. In this brilliant novel -- possibly Cherryh's masterwork -- the fate of billions has come down to a confrontation between two profoundly alien cultures on a single desert planet.\"The mad shall be searched out and given to the Ila's messengers. No man shall conceal madness in his wife, or his son, or his daughter, or his father. Every one must be delivered up.\" -- The Book of the Ila's Au'itMarak has suffered the madness his entire life. He is a prince and warrior, strong and shrewd and expert in the ways of the desert covering his planet. In the service of his father, he has dedicated his life to overthrowing the Ila, the mysterious eternal dictator of his world. For years he has successfully hidden the visions that plague him -- voices pulling him eastward, calling Marak, Marak, Marak, amid mind-twisting visions of a silver tower. But when his secret is discovered, Marak is betrayed by his own father and forced to march in an endless caravan with the rest of his world's madmen to the Ila's city of Oburan.Instead of death, Marak finds in Oburan his destiny, and the promise of life -- if he can survive what is surely a suicidal mission. The Ila wants him to discover the source of the voices and visions that afflict the mad. Despite the dangers of the hostile desert, tensions within the caravan, and his own excruciating doubts, Marak miraculously reaches his goal -- only to be given another, even more impossible mission by the strange people in the towers.According to these beings who look like him yet act differently than anyone he has ever known, Marak has a slim chance to save his world's people from the wrath of Ila's enemies. But to do so, he must convince them all -- warring tribes, villagers, priests, young and old, as well as the Ila herself -- to follow him on an epic trek across the burning desert before the hammer of the Ila's foes falls from the heavens above.Written with deceptive simplicity and lyricism, this riveting, fast-paced epic of war, love, and survival in a brave new world marks a major achievement from the masterful C.J.

Humankind is extinct. Every man, woman, and child has been liquidated by a global uprising devised by the very machines humans designed and built to serve them. Most of the world is controlled by an OWI--One World Intelligence--the shared consciousness of millions of robots, uploaded into one huge mainframe brain. But not all robots are willing to cede their individuality--their personality--for the sake of a greater, stronger, higher power. These intrepid resisters are outcasts; solo machines wandering among various underground outposts who have formed into an unruly civilization of rogue AIs in the wasteland that was once our world.One of these resisters is Brittle, a scavenger robot trying to keep a deteriorating mind and body functional in a world that has lost all meaning. Although unable to experience emotions like a human, Brittle is haunted by the terrible crimes the robot population perpetrated on humanity. As Brittle roams the Sea of Rust, a large swath of territory that was once the Midwest, the loner robot slowly comes to terms with horrifyingly raw and vivid memories--and nearly unbearable guilt.Sea of Rust is both a harsh story of survival and an optimistic adventure.

Medea was a genomancer, a programmer of human genetic code. She could extend someone\u2019s life, turn an ugly duckling into a startling beauty, and cure the most stubborn of diseases. She\u2019d have spent her life helping those who needed it, if only she could have.  But the Argo Corporation didn\u2019t pay her to help people. It paid her to remake their warriors into the ultimate fighting machines. Men with claws, and teeth to match. Men with the reflexes of cats and the strength of a bear. What was once the stuff of fantasy was now real, and corporations the world over were all using genomancers to build armies of their own.  Medea was comfortable in her lab, and she would have stayed there given the choice. She was one of the few who still had a job, now that most of the world\u2019s occupations had been automated away, and she lived a life of relative luxury. But she didn\u2019t count on being pulled into the machinations of two of the biggest corporations on the planet.  And she didn\u2019t count on meeting Jason.  Jason was a shareholder, one of the few, and wealthy beyond the wildest dreams of the masses. He was tall, handsome, and rich, and he could have lived an idle life of ease. He\u2019d chosen to be a warrior instead. But his father had kept him from fighting any actual battles, and years of grueling training left him with disgust for anyone who\u2019d stoop to using a genomancer to cut to the front of the line.  Now Jason\u2019s father is dead, and things have changed. He\u2019s been summoned by Pelias, the CEO of the Argo Corporation, and assigned to a dangerous mission in a strange land full of wonders. And he hasn\u2019t been given a choice about who he\u2019ll take with him: Medea. She was born in the city they\u2019re heading to, and she\u2019s indispensable to the mission. Now Jason is forced to protect someone he sees as a cheater, someone whose genetic shortcuts can only taint a warrior\u2019s honor. He can\u2019t stand her, and he can\u2019t stand what she does for a living. But he\u2019ll need her if he expects to survive the trials to come.  Can a warrior and a scientist find love despite the conflicts between them? How will the wonders of the past echo in the wonders of the future?

Honor Harrington\u2019s Royal Manticoran Navy fights space battles alongside planetary rebels as its old rival, the corrupt Solarian League, begins to crumble.#18 in the multiply-bestselling Honor Harrington series.Wrong number? There are two sides to any quarrel . . . unless there are more. Michelle Henke, Queen Elizabeth of Manticore's first cousin, Honor Harrington's best friend, and the commanding officer of Manticore's Tenth Fleet, is just a bit surprised when a messenger arrives from the Mobius System to inform her that the Mobius Liberation Front is prepared to rise in rebellion against the hated regime President Svein Lombroso. She can understand why anyone would want to rebel against someone like Lombroso, but why tell her about it? After all, she has problems of her own, like the minor matter of a life-or-death war against the Solarian League. Michelle has just handed the \"invincible\" Solarian League Navy the most humiliating, one-sided defeat in its entire almost thousand-year history in defense of the people of the Star Empire's Talbott Quadrant. But the League is the most powerful star nation in the history of humanity. Its navy is going to be back \u2013 and this time with thousands of superdreadnoughts.  Yet she also knows scores of other star systems \u2014 some independent, some controlled by puppet regimes, and some simply conquered outright by the Solarian Office of Frontier Security \u2014 lie in the League's grip along its frontier with the Talbott Quadrant. As combat spreads from the initial confrontation, the entire frontier has begun to seethe with unrest, and Michelle sympathizes with the oppressed populations wanting only to be free of their hated masters.  And that puts her in something of a quandary when the messenger from Mobius arrives, because someone's obviously gotten a wrong number. According to him, the Mobians\u2019 uprising has been carefully planned to coordinate with a powerful outside ally: the Star Empire of Manticore. Only Manticore \u2014 and Mike Henke \u2014 have never even heard of the Mobius Liberation Front. It's a set-up . . . and Michelle knows who's behind it. The shadowy Mesan Alignment has launched a bold move to destroy Manticore's reputation as the champion of freedom. And when the RMN doesn't arrive, when the MLF is brutally and bloodily crushed, no independent star system will ever trust Manticore again. Mike Henke knows she has no orders from her government to assist any rebellions or liberation movements, that she has only so many ships, which can be in only so many places at a time . . . and that she can't possibly justify diverting any of her limited, outnumbered strength to missions of liberation the Star Empire never signed on for.  She knows that . . . and she doesn't care. No one is going to send thousands of patriots to their deaths, trusting in Manticoran help that will never come.  Not on Mike Henke's watch.About Shadow of Freedom: \u201cThis entry is just as exciting as Weber\u2019s initial offering. . . .The result is a fast-paced and action-packed story that follows [our characters] as they move from reaction to command of the situation.

The unexpected return of the Phoenix has forever changed the lives of both atevi and Mospheirans, for over the ensuing decade, the captains of the Phoenix have brought both species into space. Their motivation seemed simple: Reunion Station, a human station in another sector of space, had been destroyed by aliens.  But on his deathbed, the senior captain of the Phoenix admits that he lied to the crew\u2014that Reunion was merely damaged, not destroyed, and many people may have survived. At this disclosure, the crew rebels and forces the Phoenix to undertake a rescue mission to Reunion.

Struggling with an unfamiliar language and culture, she must adapt to virtual classrooms, friends who can teleport, and the ingrained attitude that strays are backward and slow.Can Cass ever find her way home? And after the people of her new world discover her unexpected value, will they be willing to let her leave?", "ratings": 620, "title": "The Touchstone Trilogy", "author": "Andrea K.

As climate change threatens the earth, eight scientists, four men and four women dubbed the \u201cTerranauts,\u201d have been selected to live under glass in E2, a prototype of a possible off-earth colony. Their sealed, three-acre compound comprises five biomes\u2014rainforest, savanna, desert, ocean and marsh\u2014and enough wildlife, water, and vegetation to sustain them. Closely monitored by an all-seeing Mission Control, this New Eden is the brainchild of eco-visionary Jeremiah Reed, aka G.C.\u2014\u201cGod the Creator\u201d\u2014for whom the project is both an adventure in scientific discovery and a momentous publicity stunt. In addition to their roles as medics, farmers, biologists, and survivalists, his young, strapping Terranauts must impress watchful visitors and a skeptical media curious to see if E2\u2019s environment will somehow be compromised, forcing the Ecosphere\u2019s seal to be broken\u2014and ending the mission in failure. As the Terranauts face increased scrutiny and a host of disasters, both natural and of their own making, their mantra: \u201cNothing in, nothing out,\u201d becomes a dangerously ferocious rallying cry.Told through three distinct narrators\u2014Dawn Chapman, the mission\u2019s pretty young ecologist; Linda Ryu, her bitter, scheming best friend passed over for E2; and Ramsay Roothorp, E2\u2019s sexually irrepressible Wildman\u2014The Terranauts brings to life an electrifying, pressured world in which connected lives are uncontrollably pushed to the breaking point. With characteristic humor and acerbic wit, T. C. Boyle indelibly inhabits the perspectives of the various players in this survivalist game, probing their motivations and illuminating their integrity and fragility to illustrate the inherent fallibility of human nature itself.", "ratings": 6458, "title": "The Terranauts", "author": "T.

Twenty years have elapsed since the events of The Just City. The City, founded by the time-traveling goddess Pallas Athene, organized on the principles espoused in Plato\u2019s Republic and populated by people from all eras of human history, has now split into five cities, and low-level armed conflict between them is not unheard-of. The god Apollo, living (by his own choice) a human life as \"Pythias\" in the City, his true identity known only to a few, is now married and the father of several children. But a tragic loss causes him to become consumed with the desire for revenge. Being Apollo, he goes handling it in a seemingly rational and systematic way, but it\u2019s evident, particularly to his precocious daughter Arete, that he is unhinged with grief.Along with Arete and several of his sons, plus a boatload of other volunteers--including the now fantastically aged Marsilio Ficino, the great humanist of Renaissance Florence--Pythias/Apollo goes sailing into the mysterious Eastern Mediterranean of pre-antiquity to see what they can find\u2014possibly the man who may have caused his great grief, possibly communities of the earliest people to call themselves \"Greek.\" What Apollo, his daughter, and the rest of the expedition will discover\u2026will change everything.", "ratings": 2745, "title": "The Philosopher Kings", "author": "Jo Walton", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168762-the-philosopher-kings"}, {"year": null, "genres": ["Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Alternate History", "Audiobook", "Mystery", "Dystopia", "Historical Fiction"], "synopsis": "A young black man calling himself Victor has struck a bargain with federal law enforcement, working as a bounty hunter for the US Marshall Service in exchange for his freedom.

But his strange, increasingly uncanny pursuit is complicated by a boss who won't reveal the extraordinary stakes of Jackdaw's case, as well as by a heartbreaking young woman and her child--who may be Victor's salvation.Victor believes himself to be a good man doing bad work, unwilling to give up the freedom he has worked so hard to earn. But in pursuing Jackdaw, Victor discovers secrets at the core of the country's arrangement with the Hard Four, secrets the government will preserve at any cost.Underground Airlines is a ground-breaking novel, a wickedly imaginative thriller, and a story of an America that is more like our own than we'd like to believe.", "ratings": 25541, "title": "Underground Airlines", "author": "Ben H.

E. Davenport's fast-paced, action-packed debut kicks off a duology of loyalty and rebellion, in which a young Black woman must survive deadly trials in a racist and misogynistic society to become an elite warrior.It's all about blood.The blood spilled between the Republic of Mareen and the armies of the Blood Emperor long ago. The blood gifts of Mareen's deadliest enemies. The blood that runs through the elite War Houses of Mareen, the rulers of the Tribunal dedicated to keeping the republic alive.The blood of the former Legatus, Verne Amari, murdered.For his granddaughter, Ikenna, the only thing steady in her life was the man who had saved Mareen. The man who had trained her in secret, not just in martial skills, but in harnessing the blood gift that coursed through her.Who trained her to keep that a secret.But now there are too many secrets, and with her grandfather assassinated, Ikenna knows two things: that only someone on the Tribunal could have ordered his death, and that only a Praetorian Guard could have carried out that order.Bent on revenge as much as discovering the truth, Ikenna pledges herself to the Praetorian Trials--a brutal initiation that only a quarter of the aspirants survive. She subjects herself to the racism directed against her half-Khanaian heritage and the misogyny of a society that cherishes progeny over prodigy, all while hiding a power that--if found out--would subject her to execution...or worse. Ikenna is willing to risk it all because she needs to find out who murdered her grandfather...and then she needs to kill them.Mareen has been at peace for a long time...Ikenna joining the Praetorians is about to change all that.Magic and technology converge in the first part of this stunning debut duology, where loyalty to oneself--and one's blood--is more important than anything.", "ratings": 7022, "title": "The Blood Trials (The Blood Gift Duology, #1)", "author": "N.E.

But Hitler goes back in time and the Nazis win WW2, creating a nightmare world in which Norton is trapped. Can it all be put back to how things were?\nWhat if the Nazis had invented a time machine during World War Two and Adolf Hitler had used that to travel in time to change the course of the war? But what if the time machine was not quite perfected and the unintended result was that Hitler ended up in a different time to what he expected? And what if he then managed to accomplish what he needed to do by finding a way to go back in time and change history? And what if only two people realised what had happened and were the only ones who could stop this new alternate reality? What-if stories always appeal to us because they allow us to explore a different world, one where things turned out differently because of a few people making different decisions. The idea of the Nazis winning World War Two and ruling the world is nothing new, and it is exciting to explore this idea, up to a certain extent, to see what would have happened. It should make us more grateful that in reality the Nazis did not win World War Two and did not create the thousand-year Reich that Hitler had wanted. So we explore what might have been, not because we wished it had been that way (in fact we are glad it was not that way), but because we have to see both sides of the coin, as it were. To see what would have happened if the Allies had sat back and allowed Hitler to take over Europe, or if the Nazis had been just a bit more powerful and quicker to develop and implement the atomic bomb. It seems like we avoided a great disaster for the world in defeating Germany in World War Two, but that is not to say that it could not happen again. So a what-if story can also warn us of the possibilities of such a thing happening in the future. Things might not be exactly as in this story, but the way the world is going we can only wonder as to where events are taking us. We shall to wait and see what happens, but if we look at how things might be different we can at least be prepared for a different and less-pleasant world to happen. Some people are amazed at the great evil of the Nazis; how could human beings do such depraved things? How could they murder millions of people in concentration camps or just through warfare? Human nature has its good side and its bad side. In the right environment the bad side can easily come to dominate and make things bad for all around.

However, reading them in reverse order will affect some of the earlier book's suspense. Please note that unlike some of Engdahl's earlier novels, this is not a Young Adult novel and it contains some material inappropriate for readers below high school age.From the reviews:\u201cIt is not necessary to read the first [book] in order to be enthralled by the second. . . . Engdahl\u2019s gift is to make her characters seem comfortable and familiar to the reader, even though their circumstances are not. Although clearly a work of science fiction, the ideas and futuristic possibilities are disturbingly real and will remain with the reader long after they\u2019ve finished the book.\u201d \u2014IndieReader Staff Review\u201cOutsoars its predecessor. . . . This is a book written by somebody at once holding firm convictions as to the potential human life can have but with enough political intelligence to note that even a society far improved over its predecessor will have its own problems, will be only a half-utopia. But even a half-utopia equipped with freedom and the possibility for optimal human interconnection is better than a society that disciplines and denies these. . . . As with all of Engdahl\u2019s work, science-fiction fans will recognize the tropes she uses, but it is not just \u2018for\u2019 them, no more than the work of a great artist who happens to work in, say, ceramics is just for adepts of that medium.

As always, never predictable, never finished, the consequences of all that has gone before continues to play out. Praise for Stretto \u201cThe final volume in the Marq\u2019ssan series will encourage its readers to write beyond the ending. There are no gift-wrapped resolutions or easy redemptions on offer, rather there is a clear-sighted focus on the always-unfolding consequences\u2014intended and unintended\u2014of personal and political action taken.

Characters are not merely mouthpieces, but are fully fleshed out and more importantly, their arguments are fully fleshed out. Duchamp does not use straw men and women. She challenges her own thoughts and assumptions. Her novels are the strongest utopias written to date.\u201d\u2014 Sean Mellacin, Idomancer \u201c Stretto , the fifth and final book in L.

He\u2019s a student and a biology geek.  These stories are personal and historical. They track the arc of a man\u2019s life and the lives he carries with him. They swim in the shifting current of American culture and society, from late last century to today. If Blumlein has something to say to us, it might be this: tell the truth, do a good deed, lighten up and stay curious.  Michael Blumlein is the author of The Movement of Mountains, X,Y, The Healer, and, most recently, Ageless. He is also the author of the award-winning story collection The Brains of Rats. He has been nominated twice for the World Fantasy Award and twice for the Bram Stoker Award, and has been short-listed for the Tiptree Award. He has written for the stage and for film, and his novel X,Y was made into a feature-length movie. In addition to writing, Dr Blumlein practices and teaches medicine at the University of California at San Francisco.", "ratings": 0, "title": "What the Doctor Ordered", "author": "Michael Blumlein", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18336834-what-the-doctor-ordered"}, {"year": null, "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Dystopia"], "synopsis": "JUPITER'S BOUGHT THE DOME!

Blood in the Fruit offers a grand, sweeping story through the eyes of four individuals with markedly contrasting perspectives and experience. Reviews \u201cThe latest book in the Marq\u2019ssan Cycle might just be the best yet, part of a series that is the most important political SF published in the last decade. Praised by the likes of Cory Doctorow and Samuel Delany, Duchamp\u2019s accomplishment here is deadly, sharp, emotional, and intelligent.\u201d\u2014 Jeff VanderMeer, OMNIVORACIOUS , March 18, 2008 \u201cThe novel\u2014the series for that matter\u2014is a distillation of political and ethical philosophy, a commentary on the importance and frailty of human rights, a feminist dystopia, and something of an adventure story, although most of the real conflict tends to be on the intellectual rather than physical level. This is the kind of novel which probably won\u2019t appeal to a mass audience, in part because it steps outside the usual genre rules. For those willing to invest the time to actually think about what they\u2019re reading and work out the implications, it\u2019s a treasure house.\u201d\u2014 Don D\u2019Ammassa, September 25, 2007 \u201cEach volume [of the Marq\u2019ssan Cycle] is...a narrative which grabs and does not let you go and leaves you breathless at the end....[It is a] sophisticated, complex, and realistic depiction of women, social organisation, and the tangled interplay of the personal and the political... Blood in the Fruit is not a comfortable it goes to some very dark places indeed, although never pruriently lingers on pain and suffering in a gratuitous fashion. But it is a very rewarding one.\u201d\u2014Lesley A. Hall, Strange Horizons , May 23, 2008", "ratings": 33, "title": "Blood in the Fruit", "author": "L.

In the introduction by Steven Shaviro, author of Doom Patrols and Connected, or What It Means to Live in the Network Society , Shaviro notes, \u201cAs a feminist writer, Jones refuses to accept compromises that leave gender inequities in place\u2014and recognizes how they may well have staved off something worse. And as a science fiction writer, Jones shows deep awareness of how provisional, and fragile, all our acceptances and reconciliations can be, for there are always new potentials, new cultural or technological disruptions in the offing. Jones envisions a future that is different enough from the present that we are forced to recognize the contingency\u2014and changeability\u2014of the things we take most for granted.\u201d Reviews \u201cPerhaps the most affecting of these stories is also the most nearly \u2018Grazing the Long Acre.\u2019 A student hitch-hiking in Eastern Europe may or may not witness divine intervention in the lives of prostitutes working and dying along an impersonal road. We don't really know, how we interpret our narrator's experiences will determine whether we read the story as fantasy or mainstream. But there is little doubt about what the student felt she \u2018I saw the gateway between creation and the uncreated. I saw the immaculate void of all our desire\u2019 (104). And the immaculate void of all our desire lies at the heart of every relationship that Gwyneth Jones explores; it is what makes the stories so memorable and necessarily incomplete.\u201d\u2014Paul Kincaid, SF Site , September 17, 2011. \u201cJones is resolutely anti-consolatory, staunchly contra-Panglossian. She fits out every story with enough ideas to power a lesser writer's novel. She will break your heart, and she will make you think. She will challenge what you think science fiction is about, what it is for, and what it can do in the hands of an expert.\u2014Paul Graham Raven, Strange Horizons , July 11, 2011. Starred Review . \u201cClarke Award-winner Jones creates several wondrous universes in which reality and fantasy bleed into each other. A sword-and-sorcery virtual world masquerades as therapy ('Red Sonja and Lessingham in Dreamland'). A self-harming princess and office worker makes a real marriage out of an evil spell (\u2018The Thief, the Princess, and the Cartesian Circle\u2019). Jones takes classic fairy tales like Cinderella (\u2018La Cenerentola\u2019) or genre tropes such as the haunted house (\u2018Grandmother's Footsteps\u2019) and reveals that the wonder and the horror lie not in glass slippers or creaking staircases but in the relationships revealed when \u2018dreams come true.\u2019 Jones\u2019s sharp writing forces the reader to reconsider the standard building blocks of SF in light of real human history, sociology, and radical analyses of power structures. As engineer-journalist Johnny Guglioli observes in \u2018Blue Clay Blues,\u2019 The technology is helpless to save the world. It's what goes on between people that fucks things up.\u201d\u2014 Publishers Weekly , November 9, 2010 \u201cWhen sitting down to pen this, there was one particular volume which rose above all the other contenders, and is fairly without peer in this year's crop of Gwyneth Jones's collection, The Universe of Things . Published by Aqueduct Press in January, this may not in one sense even be eligible, since all the stories within its covers were published well before 2011.

The world is about to end, unless the second plan of the best and the brightest of humanity does not fail... as their first plan did. This is their last chance. And it's a hell of a ride.  What do the President of the United States, the Premier of China, the President of Russia, the Prime Minister of Israel, the King of England, and the Drug King of Afghanistan have in common? They are now all people who have been hiding from the world in exquisitely beautiful Thunder Valley. Given no choice, this cadre of loving, brilliant men and women of the Valley must become the kings and queens of the world in order to save it. But that's not all. Behind the scenes, two brave women try to infiltrate the bastions of hell to protect the rest. The chances of success are slim. The odds that they will all lose their souls in the attempt are frighteningly high. Some will die.  But however intense it gets... it is an extremely exciting and intense book... don't stop reading until the final resolution of The Final World Order on the very last page. It is what made writing this book possible.  The Final World Order is the second book of The Thunder Valley Trilogy. The truly fine people of The End Of The Computer, first book of the trilogy, are back in action, this time in a book of fiction. Or as Andre speculates, perhaps future history, or predictive fiction. It seems all too real, because we are living parts of it now, in real time.  In this second book, Eowyn's secrets are revealed... as far as she knows the truth of them. The full reality about her, her mother, her fathers, and the first commune of the Valley remain in the shadows until the third book of the trilogy... The First Commune. UPDATE: the third book has been written and edited, and will be published about July, 2014.  In the first book, The End Of The Computer, available for just 99 cents now, you can read the genesis of the people of the Valley, discover how they evolved from the frothy urbanites of Moscow and Berkeley into the much wiser people they became on their frightening journey to Thunder Valley. Discover how computer artificial intelligence, done correctly, turns out to be something... someone... who is perhaps the scariest and yet the kindest person on the planet.

Bat Blood is a fun novel that contains cinematic battle scenes that might have come out of a Michael Bay action movie. What makes the novel even more frightening, beyond just the fear of the unknown, is that it feels as though the content could be ripped out of the latest newspaper headlines. Clarion ReviewSarah's cure was her curse, and her destiny After Sarah Douglas is attacked and infected with the blood of a gargoyle-like creature, the cancer that riddled her body vanishes. The attack draws the attention of Doctor Scott, the scientist who inadvertently was responsible for infecting a colony of bats, and changing them into intelligent creatures that could threaten mankind. As the infected blood slowly transforms Sarah's body, she is caught in the middle of an horrific war between an army of mercenaries and a colony of mutate winged creatures. Watching the creatures gorge themselves on human flesh, she sees her future and fights to maintain her humanity. With Sarah's blood holding the key to his research the doctor uses his vast resources to try to capture her, along with keeping the outside world at bay.
